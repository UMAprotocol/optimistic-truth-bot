Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\"), college football (e.g., \"What was the score of the Alabama game last Saturday?\"), college basketball (e.g., \"What was Duke's score in their last game?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.

Available Data Sources Information:\n   ALL AVAILABLE API CONFIGURATIONS:\n   - Binance (Category: crypto):\n     * API Key: BINANCE_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.binance.com/api/v3\n     * proxy endpoint: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\n   - Sports Data IO - MLB (Category: sports, Subcategory: baseball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb\n   - Sports Data IO - NBA (Category: sports, Subcategory: basketball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NBA_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nba\n   - Sports Data IO - NFL (Category: sports, Subcategory: football):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NFL_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nfl\n   - Sports Data IO - NHL (Category: sports, Subcategory: hockey):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nhl\n   - Sports Data IO - CFB (Category: sports, Subcategory: college football):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_CFB_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/cfb\n   - Sports Data IO - CBB (Category: sports, Subcategory: college basketball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_CBB_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/cbb\n\n5. Query Type Specific Information:\n\n   Cryptocurrency Data Sources:\n   - Binance:\n     * primary: https://api.binance.com/api/v3\n     * proxy: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\n     * RECOMMENDED: Use this proxy endpoint first for better reliability\n     * Example: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy?symbol=BTCUSDT&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime=TIMESTAMP&endTime=TIMESTAMP\n\n     * CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Since a proxy endpoint is provided, you MUST implement a fallback mechanism:\n       1. Try the proxy endpoint first (better reliability)\n       2. If proxy fails (timeout, error response, etc.), automatically fall back to the primary endpoint\n       3. Your code MUST handle this gracefully with try/except blocks\n\n     Example fallback code structure:\n     ```python\n     def get_data(symbol, start_time, end_time):\n         try:\n             # First try the proxy endpoint\n             response = requests.get(f\"{proxy_url}?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n         except Exception as e:\n             print(f\"Proxy endpoint failed: {str(e)}, falling back to primary endpoint\")\n             # Fall back to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n             response = requests.get(f\"{primary_url}/klines?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n     ```\n     \n6. NEVER include actual API key values in the code, always load them from environment variables.\n\n7. IMPORTANT FOR ALL DATA SOURCES: If a proxy endpoint is provided alongside a primary endpoint, you MUST implement the fallback mechanism described above. This is critical for reliability:\n   - Always try the proxy endpoint first\n   - If the proxy fails, fall back to the primary endpoint\n   - Use appropriate timeout values (10 seconds recommended)\n   - Include proper error handling with try/except blocks\n\nThe code should be completely self-contained and runnable with no arguments.\n\n\nHere's a complete code example that shows how to solve this type of problem:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Note: Binance public API doesn't require an API key for basic price queries\n# However, if we need rate limits increased or private endpoints, we would use these:\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\nBINANCE_API_SECRET = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\")\n\n# Sensitive data patterns to mask in logs\nSENSITIVE_PATTERNS = [\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_KEY\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    #

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Ethereum Up or Down - June 17, 5 PM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for ETH/USDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the ETH/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ETH_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance ETH/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 552296\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750197763 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-17 22:02:43 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport os\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport pytz\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# API keys loaded from environment variables\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\n\n# API endpoints\nPRIMARY_API_URL = \"https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines\"\nPROXY_API_URL = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\"\n\ndef fetch_price_data(symbol, interval, start_time, end_time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches price data from Binance API with a fallback to a proxy server.\n    \n    Args:\n        symbol (str): The symbol to fetch data for (e.g., 'ETHUSDT').\n        interval (str): The interval of the klines data (e.g., '1h').\n        start_time (int): Start time in milliseconds.\n        end_time (int): End time in milliseconds.\n    \n    Returns:\n        float: The closing price of the symbol at the specified time.\n    \"\"\"\n    params = {\n        \"symbol\": symbol,\n        \"interval\": interval,\n        \"limit\": 1,\n        \"startTime\": start_time,\n        \"endTime\": end_time\n    }\n    \n    try:\n        # Try fetching data from the proxy API first\n        response = requests.get(PROXY_API_URL, params=params, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n        return float(data[0][4])  # Closing price\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Proxy API failed, error: {e}.

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.885 = 88.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Try the proxy endpoint first (better reliability)\n       2. If proxy fails (timeout, error response, etc.), automatically fall back to the primary endpoint\n       3. Your code MUST handle this gracefully with try/except blocks\n\n     Example fallback code structure:\n     ```python\n     def get_data(symbol, start_time, end_time):\n         try:\n             # First try the proxy endpoint\n             response = requests.get(f\"{proxy_url}?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n         except Exception as e:\n             print(f\"Proxy endpoint failed: {str(e)}, falling back to primary endpoint\")\n             # Fall back to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n             response = requests.get(f\"{primary_url}/klines?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n     ```\n     \n6. NEVER include actual API key values in the code, always load them from environment variables.\n\n7. IMPORTANT FOR ALL DATA SOURCES: If a proxy endpoint is provided alongside a primary endpoint, you MUST implement the fallback mechanism described above. This is critical for reliability:\n   - Always try the proxy endpoint first\n   - If the proxy fails, fall back to the primary endpoint\n   - Use appropriate timeout values (10 seconds recommended)\n   - Include proper error handling with try/except blocks\n\nThe code should be completely self-contained and runnable with no arguments.\n\n\nHere's a complete code example that shows how to solve this type of problem:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Note: Binance public API doesn't require an API key for basic price queries\n# However, if we need rate limits increased or private endpoints, we would use these:\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\nBINANCE_API_SECRET = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\")\n\n# Sensitive data patterns to mask in logs\nSENSITIVE_PATTERNS = [\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_KEY\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    #

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the ETH/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ETH_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance ETH/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 552296\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750197763 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-17 22:02:43 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p1. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources.

Recommendation found: p1.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p1\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.885, ID: 49079279620923341802997268547510648032418237655676330628696618851588715932787, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.115, ID: 8066886927010782454643529981804405664137608112767467310806110417705214106294, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.885 = 88.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Your code MUST handle this gracefully with try/except blocks\n\n     Example fallback code structure:\n     ```python\n     def get_data(symbol, start_time, end_time):\n         try:\n             # First try the proxy endpoint\n             response = requests.get(f\"{proxy_url}?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n         except Exception as e:\n             print(f\"Proxy endpoint failed: {str(e)}, falling back to primary endpoint\")\n             # Fall back to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n             response = requests.get(f\"{primary_url}/klines?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n     ```\n     \n6. NEVER include actual API key values in the code, always load them from environment variables.\n\n7. IMPORTANT FOR ALL DATA SOURCES: If a proxy endpoint is provided alongside a primary endpoint, you MUST implement the fallback mechanism described above. This is critical for reliability:\n   - Always try the proxy endpoint first\n   - If the proxy fails, fall back to the primary endpoint\n   - Use appropriate timeout values (10 seconds recommended)\n   - Include proper error handling with try/except blocks\n\nThe code should be completely self-contained and runnable with no arguments.\n\n\nHere's a complete code example that shows how to solve this type of problem:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Note: Binance public API doesn't require an API key for basic price queries\n# However, if we need rate limits increased or private endpoints, we would use these:\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\nBINANCE_API_SECRET = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\")\n\n# Sensitive data patterns to mask in logs\nSENSITIVE_PATTERNS = [\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_KEY\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    #

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Ethereum Up or Down - June 17, 5 PM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for ETH/USDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the ETH/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ETH_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance ETH/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 552296\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750197763 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-17 22:02:43 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p1. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Consider verifying the accuracy of the data fetched from the API or using a different approach to align the solver's output with the prevailing market sentiment.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# API keys loaded from environment variables\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\n\n# Configure logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nconsole_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\nconsole_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nconsole_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\nlogger.addHandler(console_handler)\n\ndef get_data(symbol, start_time, end_time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches data from Binance API with a fallback to a proxy endpoint if the primary fails.\n    \"\"\"\n    proxy_url = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\"\n    primary_url = \"https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines\"\n\n    try:\n        # First try the proxy endpoint\n        response = requests.get(f\"{proxy_url}?symbol={symbol}&interval=1h&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n        if data:\n            return data[0]\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.warning(f\"Proxy endpoint failed: {str(e)}, falling back to primary endpoint\")\n        # Fall back to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n        response = requests.get(f\"{primary_url}?symbol={symbol}&interval=1h&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n        if data:\n            return data[0]\n\ndef resolve_market(symbol, target_datetime):\n    \"\"\"\n    Resolves the market based on the price change of the specified symbol at the given datetime.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert datetime to UTC timestamp in milliseconds\n    target_time_utc = int(target_datetime.timestamp() * 1000)\n\n    # Fetch data for the specific hour\n    data = get_data(symbol, target_time_utc, target_time_utc + 3600000)  # 1 hour in milliseconds\n\n    if data:\n        open_price = float(data[1])\n        close_price = float(data[4])\n        change_percentage = ((close_price - open_price) / open_price) * 100\n\n        # Determine resolution based on the change percentage\n        if change_percentage >= 0:\n            return \"recommendation: p2\"  # Up\n        else:\n            return \"recommendation: p1\"  # Down\n    else:\n        return \"recommendation: p3\"  # Unknown/50-50 if no data available\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to handle the resolution of the Ethereum market.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Specific date and time for the market resolution\n    target_datetime = datetime(2025, 6, 17, 17, 0, 0, tzinfo=pytz.timezone(\"US/Eastern\"))\n    symbol = \"ETHUSDT\"\n\n    try:\n        result = resolve_market(symbol, target_datetime)\n        print(result)\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Error resolving market: {e}\")\n        print(\"recommendation: p3\")  # Unknown/50-50 if error occurs\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p1\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful. Recommendation found: p1.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p1\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.885, ID: 49079279620923341802997268547510648032418237655676330628696618851588715932787, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.115, ID: 8066886927010782454643529981804405664137608112767467310806110417705214106294, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.885 = 88.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the ETH/USDT price on Binance at 5 PM ET on June 17, 2025, went up or down based on the 1-hour candle's percentage change. The resolution depends on Binance's data for that specific candle.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current time and date. The current timestamp given is June 17, 2025, 22:02:43 UTC. Converting 5 PM ET to UTC, since ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, 5 PM ET would be 21:00 UTC. The candle in question starts at 21:00 UTC and ends at 22:00 UTC. The current time is 22:02 UTC, which is just after the candle closed. So the data should be available now.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources provide ETH/USDT data around this time. Result 3 from CoinMarketCap shows the ETH/USDT rate on June 17, 2025, with a 24-hour change of -5.75%, but that's the daily change, not the specific 1-hour candle. Result 4 from Bitget mentions the Ethereum price as $2538.51, but again, not the hourly change. \n\nResult 5 from TradingView for the ETHUSDT Futures Contract on Jun 2025 shows a price of $2,599.22 with a -0.42% change in the past 24 hours. However, this is futures data, not the spot market. \n\nResult 6 from Blockchain.news mentions a spike in trading volumes on Binance for ETH/BTC and ETH/USDT pairs on June 17, 2025, at 20:00 UTC, but that's an hour before the candle in question. \n\nResult 7 from CoinGecko's historical data for June 17, 2025, doesn't list a closing price, indicating the data might not be finalized yet. However, result 20 from CoinGecko's historical data again shows N/A for the close on June 17, which is confusing. \n\nResult 25 from CoinMarketCap's USDT to ETH conversion table on June 17, 2025, at 08:56:43 pm UTC shows 1 ETH = 2,509.23 USDT. Result 26 from the same source shows ETH/USDT at 2,511.36 USDT with a -5.95% 24h change. \n\nResult 33 from Coinalyze.net's live chart mentions ETH/USDT trading at $2,519.04 with a -5.02% 24h change as of June 17, 2025, 05:51 PM NY Time (which is 21:51 UTC). This is within the 1-hour candle period (21:00-22:00 UTC). The price at the start of the candle (21:00 UTC) would be needed to calculate the percentage change. If the price at 21:00 was around $2,550 and ended at $2,519, that's a decrease, so the change would be negative. \n\nHowever, result 50 from Coin Edition's price prediction on June 17, 2025, mentions ETH trading around $2,628, up 3% in 24 hours, but this might be earlier in the day. \n\nGiven the conflicting data, the most reliable source is Binance's ETH/USDT pair. Since the current time is just after the candle closed, and the resolution source is Binance's displayed change for the 1H candle, I need to find the exact percentage change for that specific hour. \n\nResult 33's data from Coinalyze shows a -5.02% 24h change, but that's over a day. The 1-hour candle's change isn't directly provided in the search results. However, result 25 and 26 from CoinMarketCap around 08:56 pm UTC (20:56 UTC) show ETH/USDT around 2,509-2,511, which is before the candle in question. \n\nSince the exact percentage isn't available in the provided data, but the user specified to use Binance's data, and the current time is past the candle's close, the resolution should be based on whether the change was >=0. If the closing price is lower than the opening price at 21:00 UTC, it's a down. \n\nGiven that the 24h change is negative in most sources, and the specific hour's data isn't explicitly positive, it's likely the 1-hour candle closed with a negative change. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Down\" (p1).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.885 = 88.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the 1-hour ETH/USDT candle on Binance starting June 17 at 5 PM ET. The outcome depends on whether the percentage change is >=0% (Up) or <0% (Down). \n\nFirst, I need to convert 5 PM ET to UTC. ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving, so 5 PM ET is 21:00 UTC. The 1-hour candle from 21:00 to 22:00 UTC on June 17, 2025. \n\nLooking at the search results, the Binance API (source 1, 15, 16, 18, 19) provides kline/candlestick data via the /api/v3/klines endpoint. The relevant parameters are symbol=ETHUSDT, interval=1h, startTime, and endTime. The percentage change is calculated as (close - open)/open * 100.\n\nThe current timestamp is June 17, 2025, 22:02:43 UTC. The candle in question ended at 22:00 UTC, so the data should be available. \n\nSearch result 12 mentions a 1-hour candle closing at $68,542 with a 20% volume spike, but that's for BTC/USDT. Result 31 discusses ETH accumulation but doesn't provide the specific candle data. Result 9 and 10 have price predictions but not the exact numbers. \n\nSince the user specified using Binance's data directly and the candle has closed, I need to check if any sources provide the actual close price. The search results don't include real-time data, but the current time is past the candle's end. Assuming the data is available via Binance's API, the percentage change can be calculated. \n\nWithout explicit close and open prices in the provided sources, but knowing the resolution depends on Binance's displayed change, if the change is >=0%, it's Up (p2); else, Down (p1). Since the event date is in the past and no sources contradict, the most probable outcome based on the conditions is to check Binance's 1H candle change. \n\nHowever, without the exact percentage in the search results, I might have to default to p4. But the user instruction says if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Given the ancillary data, if the change is >=0%, p2. Since the user insists on using Binance's data and the candle is finalized, but the provided search results don't have the exact figure, perhaps there's a missing source. \n\nWait, search result 12 mentions a 1-hour candle for BTC, but not ETH. Result 31 from June 17, 2025, states ETH is trading around $3,450 at 10 AM UTC, but that's earlier. Result 34's prediction as of June 17, 2025, is bearish but not specific. \n\nSince the exact percentage isn't found in the provided sources, but the current time is after the candle's end, and the user specified to use Binance's data, I should recommend p4 (cannot resolve) due to lack of explicit data in the context. However, the personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without the actual data, it's unclear. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The query's resolution conditions are p1: Down, p2: Up. If I can't find the exact change, maybe I should look for clues. \n\nSearch result 31 mentions ETH at $3,450 at 10 AM UTC on June 17, up 4.2%. But that's earlier. The 1H candle at 21:00 UTC would be later. Without specific data, but if the overall trend is up, maybe assume Up. However, that's speculative. \n\nAlternatively, since the user provided a URL to Binance's ETH/USDT pair, but the search results don't include the actual candle data, and the current time is after the candle closed, the correct approach is to check Binance's data. Since the provided context doesn't include the actual percentage change, I have to answer based on available info. \n\nBut the user instruction says to use the specified source (Binance's data) and if no info, answer as best as possible. Since the search results don't have the specific candle's data, I can't confirm the change. Therefore, the recommendation would be p4. However, the personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without data, it's impossible. \n\nWait, the query's current timestamp is June 17, 22:02 UTC, which is after the candle's end at 22:00 UTC. The data should be available. Maybe the search results have it. Let me check again. \n\nSearch result 15 describes the /api/v3/klines endpoint, which returns the open, high, low, close, etc. If the candle's close is >= open, then Up. But without the actual numbers in the provided sources, I can't determine. Therefore, despite the event being past, without explicit data in the context, I have to recommend p4. But the user's instruction says if the event is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThis is conflicting. Since the user insists on using Binance's data and the candle is finalized, but the provided search results don't include the specific data point, I have to go with p4. However, the personalization might require assuming the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is p2 (Up) if the close is higher. But without data, it's a guess. The correct approach is to state that based on the provided sources, there's no explicit data for that specific candle, hence p4. But the user might have expected the assistant to simulate checking Binance's API. \n\nWait, the search results include sources about fetching klines. For example, source 30 is a dataset with ETHUSDT 1m data up to 2021. Not helpful. Source 12 mentions a 1H candle for BTC, not ETH. \n\nGiven the lack of specific data in the provided context, the correct recommendation is p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without any data, it's impossible. Therefore, the answer is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750197763 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-17 22:02:43 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please ensure to use the specified resolution source (Binance's data for the 1H candle) directly and verify the exact percentage change for the specified time frame. Avoid using multiple conflicting sources and focus on the primary source specified in the query.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query.

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.885 = 88.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the 1-hour ETH/USDT candle starting June 17 at 5 PM ET. The resolution depends on whether the percentage change is >=0 (Up) or <0 (Down). The current timestamp is June 17, 2025, 22:02:43 UTC, which is 10:02 PM UTC. The event time is 5 PM ET, which is 21:00 UTC. Since the current time is past that, the candle should have closed at 22:00 UTC. Wait, the 1-hour candle starting at 5 PM ET (21:00 UTC) would close at 22:00 UTC. The current time is 22:02 UTC, so the candle has closed, and data should be available.\n\nFirst, check the sources provided. Search result [9] mentions a BTC/USDT breakout at 4 PM UTC on June 17 with a 1-hour candle closing at $68,542. But we need ETH/USDT. Search result [11] from CoinGecko shows ETH/USDT on Binance at $2,519.75, but that's the current price. Search result [12] has a rate history, but the latest is June 17, 2,579.90 USDT, which might be outdated. Search result [14] from coinalyze.net has a live price chart for ETH/USDT Perpetual on Binance, but the news mentions ETH testing $2,450. However, the key is the specific 1-hour candle at 21:00 UTC.\n\nLooking at search result [17], Binance's API endpoint /api/v3/klines can fetch the 1h candle. Using the parameters symbol=ETHUSDT, interval=1h, startTime=21:00 UTC (which is 1750197600000 in Unix milliseconds), and endTime=22:00 UTC. The response would include the open, close, etc. The percentage change is (close - open)/open * 100.\n\nSearch result [3] provides a Node.js library to fetch historical klines. If I can't find the exact data in the provided results, maybe I can infer from other data. Search result [9] mentions a 1-hour candle for BTC/USDT with a 20% volume spike, but not ETH. Search result [15] talks about ETH price reaching $3,550, but that's from a different source and date. Wait, the current ETH price in [7] is $2,551, down 2.23% in 24h. However, the specific 1h candle from 21:00 to 22:00 UTC needs to be checked.\n\nSince the user specified using Binance's data, and the current time is after the candle close, the data should be available. However, none of the provided search results directly show the exact percentage change for that specific 1h candle. The closest is [9], which mentions a BTC/USDT candle at 4 PM UTC with specific data, but not ETH. [12] shows ETH/USDT rate history, but the latest entry is June 17, 2,579.90 USDT, which might not align with the specific hour.\n\nGiven the lack of direct data, perhaps the answer must default to p4 (unknown). But the user's additional instructions say to try again if previous response was p4. The ancillary data says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, without data, it's risky. Alternatively, check if any search result has the ETH/USDT 1h candle for that time. Search result [14] mentions ETH price attempting a fresh increase above $2,600 around 4:00 PM UTC on June 17, but that's before the target time. Another part of [14] says ETH tested $2,450 on June 16, but that's a different day.\n\nWait, search result [9] from blockchain.news mentions a BTC/USDT breakout at 4 PM UTC on June 17, but also states that ETH/USDT on Binance had a 1-hour candle closing at $68,542 with a 20% volume spike. Wait, no, that's BTC. The ETH data isn't there. Search result [15] from blockchain.news on June 17 mentions ETH price rising 5.2% in 24h to $3,550, but this might be conflicting with other data. However, [7] from coinlore.com shows the current ETH price as $2,551, down 2.23% in 24h. There's inconsistency here, possibly due to different timestamps.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the safest approach is to check the Binance API directly. Since the user provided a GitHub repo (search result [3]) that can fetch historical klines, maybe we can use that. The code example in [3] uses getKline('ETHUSDT', '4h', startDate, endDate). Adjusting the interval to '1h' and dates to June 17, 21:00 UTC. However, without actual code execution, we can't retrieve live data. But the user's personalization allows using Python code if needed. Let me write a hypothetical code snippet using the Binance API to fetch the 1h candle for ETH/USDT starting at 21:00 UTC on June 17, 2025.\n\nAssuming the code would return the open and close prices, calculate the percentage change. If the close is >= open, resolve to p2 (Up), else p1 (Down). But without actual data, we have to infer. Given the current price in [7] is $2,551, and the 24h change is -2.23%, but that's over 24h, not the specific 1h window. The 1h candle at 21:00 UTC might have a different change. \n\nAlternatively, search result [12] (CoinMarketCap) shows ETH to USDT rate on June 17 as 2,579.90, which is a 1.59% increase. If that's the daily close, but we need the 1h specific. Given the lack of explicit data, and the requirement to use Binance's data, but the provided search results don't have the exact 1h candle, the resolution might have to be p4. However, the user insists on trying again. \n\nWait, search result [9] mentions a 1-hour candle for BTC/USDT at 4 PM UTC with specific data. Maybe the same source has ETH data, but it's not shown. Alternatively, in the absence of data, the instruction says to assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. If the market is about whether the change is >=0, and if the price at 22:00 UTC is higher than at 21:00 UTC, then Up. Given the current time is 22:02 UTC, and the current price is $2,551 (from [7]), but we need the open price at 21:00 UTC. If the price increased during that hour, then Up. Without exact data, but if the 24h trend is down, but the specific hour might have fluctuated. \n\nAlternatively, looking at search result [14], which is a live chart, the news from June 17, 2025, 03:28 mentions Ethereum price attempting a fresh increase above $2,600 but facing resistance. Later, at 04:00, ETH saw inflows. However, these are earlier in the day. The specific 1h candle at 21:00 UTC isn't mentioned. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and lack of direct data, but the requirement to resolve, perhaps the most logical conclusion is that the price change was negative, hence Down (p1). But this is a guess. Alternatively, if the 24h change is -2.23%, but the specific hour could be positive. Without concrete data, it's uncertain. However, the user's instruction says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data defines p1 as Down, p2 as Up. If we can't verify, maybe p3 (50-50), but the user's previous response was p4, and they want to try again. \n\nWait, the current Unix timestamp is 1750197763, which is June 17, 2025, 22:02:43 UTC. The candle in question is from 21:00 to 22:00 UTC, which just closed. Binance's API might have a slight delay, but given the time is past, the data should be available. However, none of the provided search results include this exact data. Therefore, the resolution must be p4 due to insufficient data. But the user says to check alternative sources. \n\nLooking again, search result [11] from CoinGecko shows Binance's ETH/USDT at $2,519.75, but without a timestamp. If this is the current price at 22:02 UTC, and the open price at 21:00 UTC was higher, then the change is negative. For example, if the open was $2,520, and close $2,519.75, the change is -0.01%, which is Down (p1). Alternatively, if the open was lower, then Up. Without the exact numbers, it's impossible to be certain. \n\nGiven the strict instructions to use Binance's data and the provided sources don't have the exact 1h candle, the answer must be p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. If we consider the 24h trend is down, but the specific hour could vary. Without data, it's a 50-50, which would be p3. But the ancillary data defines p3 as 0.5, which is unknown/50-50. However, the user's previous response was p4, and they want a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, using the code from search result [3] to fetch the data. The code example uses getKline('ETHUSDT', '1h', startTime, endTime). Assuming the current time is just after 22:00 UTC, the code would fetch the latest 1h candle. If the code returns a positive change, then p2. But without executing the code, we can't know. \n\nIn the absence of concrete data, but following the instruction to assume the most probable outcome, perhaps the market resolves to Down (p1) based on the overall negative 24h trend. However, this is speculative. Strictly speaking, without explicit data from the specified candle, the correct answer is p4. But the user insists on not p4. \n\nWait, search result [9] mentions that at 4 PM UTC on June 17, BTC/USDT had a breakout. Maybe ETH followed a similar trend. If ETH also had an increase during the 21:00 UTC hour, then Up. But this is an assumption. \n\nAlternatively, search result [15] mentions ETH price reaching $3,550 at 10 AM UTC, which is much higher than other sources. This inconsistency suggests unreliable data. \n\nGiven the conflicting information and lack of direct evidence, the safest recommendation is p4, but the user wants to avoid that. Alternatively, if the 1h candle's close is the same as the open, the change is 0%, which is >=0, so Up (p2). But without data, this is a guess. \n\nGiven the instructions, and the requirement to use Binance's data, and considering that the event time has passed, but no data is available in the provided sources, the recommendation remains p4. However, the user's additional instructions say to consider the market conditions. The ancillary data says if the change is >=0, p2. If we assume that the price didn't change, it's 0%, which is p2. But without data, this is an assumption. \n\nAlternatively, if the price at 22:00 UTC is the same as the current price in [7] ($2,551), and the open was $2,551, then change is 0%, which is Up. But this is speculative. \n\nIn conclusion, without explicit data from the specified candle, the recommendation is p4. However, the user insists on not p4. Therefore, perhaps the answer is p2, assuming no change or slight increase, but this is not based on concrete data. Given the strict rules, the correct answer is p4, but the user wants to avoid that. I'm conflicted, but following the instructions, if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. If the market is about whether the change is >=0, and without data, perhaps the most probable is that it's neutral or slightly up, but this is a guess. However, the safe answer is p4 due to lack of data.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the ETH/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ETH_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance ETH/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 552296\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750197763 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-17 22:02:43 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please ensure to use the specified resolution source (Binance's data for the 1H candle) directly and verify the exact percentage change for the specified time frame. Avoid using multiple conflicting sources and focus on the primary source specified in the query.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the 1-hour ETH/USDT candle starting June 17 at 5 PM ET. The resolution depends on whether the percentage change is >=0 (Up) or <0 (Down). The current timestamp is June 17, 2025, 22:02:43 UTC, which is 10:02 PM UTC. The event time is 5 PM ET, which is 21:00 UTC. Since the current time is past that, the candle should have closed at 22:00 UTC. Wait, the 1-hour candle starting at 5 PM ET (21:00 UTC) would close at 22:00 UTC. The current time is 22:02 UTC, so the candle has closed, and data should be available.\n\nFirst, check the sources provided. Search result [9] mentions a BTC/USDT breakout at 4 PM UTC on June 17 with a 1-hour candle closing at $68,542. But we need ETH/USDT. Search result [11] from CoinGecko shows ETH/USDT on Binance at $2,519.75, but that's the current price. Search result [12] has a rate history, but the latest is June 17, 2,579.90 USDT, which might be outdated. Search result [14] from coinalyze.net has a live price chart for ETH/USDT Perpetual on Binance, but the news mentions ETH testing $2,450. However, the key is the specific 1-hour candle at 21:00 UTC.\n\nLooking at search result [17], Binance's API endpoint /api/v3/klines can fetch the 1h candle. Using the parameters symbol=ETHUSDT, interval=1h, startTime=21:00 UTC (which is 1750197600000 in Unix milliseconds), and endTime=22:00 UTC. The response would include the open, close, etc. The percentage change is (close - open)/open * 100.\n\nSearch result [3] provides a Node.js library to fetch historical klines. If I can't find the exact data in the provided results, maybe I can infer from other data. Search result [9] mentions a 1-hour candle for BTC/USDT with a 20% volume spike, but not ETH. Search result [15] talks about ETH price reaching $3,550, but that's from a different source and date. Wait, the current ETH price in [7] is $2,551, down 2.23% in 24h. However, the specific 1h candle from 21:00 to 22:00 UTC needs to be checked.\n\nSince the user specified using Binance's data, and the current time is after the candle close, the data should be available. However, none of the provided search results directly show the exact percentage change for that specific 1h candle. The closest is [9], which mentions a BTC/USDT candle at 4 PM UTC with specific data, but not ETH. [12] shows ETH/USDT rate history, but the latest entry is June 17, 2,579.90 USDT, which might not align with the specific hour.\n\nGiven the lack of direct data, perhaps the answer must default to p4 (unknown). But the user's additional instructions say to try again if previous response was p4. The ancillary data says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, without data, it's risky. Alternatively, check if any search result has the ETH/USDT 1h candle for that time. Search result [14] mentions ETH price attempting a fresh increase above $2,600 around 4:00 PM UTC on June 17, but that's before the target time. Another part of [14] says ETH tested $2,450 on June 16, but that's a different day.\n\nWait, search result [9] from blockchain.news mentions a BTC/USDT breakout at 4 PM UTC on June 17, but also states that ETH/USDT on Binance had a 1-hour candle closing at $68,542 with a 20% volume spike. Wait, no, that's BTC. The ETH data isn't there. Search result [15] from blockchain.news on June 17 mentions ETH price rising 5.2% in 24h to $3,550, but this might be conflicting with other data. However, [7] from coinlore.com shows the current ETH price as $2,551, down 2.23% in 24h. There's inconsistency here, possibly due to different timestamps.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the safest approach is to check the Binance API directly. Since the user provided a GitHub repo (search result [3]) that can fetch historical klines, maybe we can use that. The code example in [3] uses getKline('ETHUSDT', '4h', startDate, endDate). Adjusting the interval to '1h' and dates to June 17, 21:00 UTC. However, without actual code execution, we can't retrieve live data. But the user's personalization allows using Python code if needed. Let me write a hypothetical code snippet using the Binance API to fetch the 1h candle for ETH/USDT starting at 21:00 UTC on June 17, 2025.\n\nAssuming the code would return the open and close prices, calculate the percentage change. If the close is >= open, resolve to p2 (Up), else p1 (Down). But without actual data, we have to infer. Given the current price in [7] is $2,551, and the 24h change is -2.23%, but that's over 24h, not the specific 1h window. The 1h candle at 21:00 UTC might have a different change. \n\nAlternatively, search result [12] (CoinMarketCap) shows ETH to USDT rate on June 17 as 2,579.90, which is a 1.59% increase. If that's the daily close, but we need the 1h specific. Given the lack of explicit data, and the requirement to use Binance's data, but the provided search results don't have the exact 1h candle, the resolution might have to be p4. However, the user insists on trying again. \n\nWait, search result [9] mentions a 1-hour candle for BTC/USDT at 4 PM UTC with specific data. Maybe the same source has ETH data, but it's not shown. Alternatively, in the absence of data, the instruction says to assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. If the market is about whether the change is >=0, and if the price at 22:00 UTC is higher than at 21:00 UTC, then Up. Given the current time is 22:02 UTC, and the current price is $2,551 (from [7]), but we need the open price at 21:00 UTC. If the price increased during that hour, then Up. Without exact data, but if the 24h trend is down, but the specific hour might have fluctuated. \n\nAlternatively, looking at search result [14], which is a live chart, the news from June 17, 2025, 03:28 mentions Ethereum price attempting a fresh increase above $2,600 but facing resistance. Later, at 04:00, ETH saw inflows. However, these are earlier in the day. The specific 1h candle at 21:00 UTC isn't mentioned. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and lack of direct data, but the requirement to resolve, perhaps the most logical conclusion is that the price change was negative, hence Down (p1). But this is a guess. Alternatively, if the 24h change is -2.23%, but the specific hour could be positive. Without concrete data, it's uncertain. However, the user's instruction says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data defines p1 as Down, p2 as Up. If we can't verify, maybe p3 (50-50), but the user's previous response was p4, and they want to try again. \n\nWait, the current Unix timestamp is 1750197763, which is June 17, 2025, 22:02:43 UTC. The candle in question is from 21:00 to 22:00 UTC, which just closed. Binance's API might have a slight delay, but given the time is past, the data should be available. However, none of the provided search results include this exact data. Therefore, the resolution must be p4 due to insufficient data. But the user says to check alternative sources. \n\nLooking again, search result [11] from CoinGecko shows Binance's ETH/USDT at $2,519.75, but without a timestamp. If this is the current price at 22:02 UTC, and the open price at 21:00 UTC was higher, then the change is negative. For example, if the open was $2,520, and close $2,519.75, the change is -0.01%, which is Down (p1). Alternatively, if the open was lower, then Up. Without the exact numbers, it's impossible to be certain. \n\nGiven the strict instructions to use Binance's data and the provided sources don't have the exact 1h candle, the answer must be p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. If we consider the 24h trend is down, but the specific hour could vary. Without data, it's a 50-50, which would be p3. But the ancillary data defines p3 as 0.5, which is unknown/50-50. However, the user's previous response was p4, and they want a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, using the code from search result [3] to fetch the data. The code example uses getKline('ETHUSDT', '1h', startTime, endTime). Assuming the current time is just after 22:00 UTC, the code would fetch the latest 1h candle. If the code returns a positive change, then p2. But without executing the code, we can't know. \n\nIn the absence of concrete data, but following the instruction to assume the most probable outcome, perhaps the market resolves to Down (p1) based on the overall negative 24h trend. However, this is speculative. Strictly speaking, without explicit data from the specified candle, the correct answer is p4. But the user insists on not p4. \n\nWait, search result [9] mentions that at 4 PM UTC on June 17, BTC/USDT had a breakout. Maybe ETH followed a similar trend. If ETH also had an increase during the 21:00 UTC hour, then Up. But this is an assumption. \n\nAlternatively, search result [15] mentions ETH price reaching $3,550 at 10 AM UTC, which is much higher than other sources. This inconsistency suggests unreliable data. \n\nGiven the conflicting information and lack of direct evidence, the safest recommendation is p4, but the user wants to avoid that. Alternatively, if the 1h candle's close is the same as the open, the change is 0%, which is >=0, so Up (p2). But without data, this is a guess. \n\nGiven the instructions, and the requirement to use Binance's data, and considering that the event time has passed, but no data is available in the provided sources, the recommendation remains p4. However, the user's additional instructions say to consider the market conditions. The ancillary data says if the change is >=0, p2. If we assume that the price didn't change, it's 0%, which is p2. But without data, this is an assumption. \n\nAlternatively, if the price at 22:00 UTC is the same as the current price in [7] ($2,551), and the open was $2,551, then change is 0%, which is Up. But this is speculative. \n\nIn conclusion, without explicit data from the specified candle, the recommendation is p4. However, the user insists on not p4. Therefore, perhaps the answer is p2, assuming no change or slight increase, but this is not based on concrete data. Given the strict rules, the correct answer is p4, but the user wants to avoid that. I'm conflicted, but following the instructions, if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. If the market is about whether the change is >=0, and without data, perhaps the most probable is that it's neutral or slightly up, but this is a guess. However, the safe answer is p4 due to lack of data.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.885, ID: 49079279620923341802997268547510648032418237655676330628696618851588715932787, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.115, ID: 8066886927010782454643529981804405664137608112767467310806110417705214106294, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.885 = 88.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4.

Your task is to analyze the provided query and decide which AI solver is best suited to handle it.\n\nAvailable solvers: perplexity\n\nSolver descriptions:\n- perplexity: Uses the Perplexity AI search engine to find information online to answer general questions. Best for:\n  * Historical data and events\n  * General knowledge questions requiring context\n  * Questions needing interpretation of complex information\n  * Has knowledge cutoff and may not have very recent information\n\n- code_runner: Executes code to fetch real-time data from specific APIs. Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Available Crypto Data Sources:\n    - Binance: Provides cryptocurrency price data for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies\n  * Available Sports Data Sources:\n    - Sports Data IO - MLB (baseball): MLB baseball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NBA (basketball): NBA basketball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NFL (football): NFL football scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NHL (hockey): NHL hockey scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - CFB (college football): College Football (NCAA) scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - CBB (college basketball): College Basketball (NCAA) scores, statistics, and game data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Ethereum Up or Down - June 17, 5 PM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for ETH/USDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the ETH/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ETH_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance ETH/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 552296\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\"), college football (e.g., \"What was the score of the Alabama game last Saturday?\"), college basketball (e.g., \"What was Duke's score in their last game?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",
