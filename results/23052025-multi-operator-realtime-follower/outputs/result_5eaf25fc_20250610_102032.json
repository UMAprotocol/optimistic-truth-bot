      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump and Musk spoke directly between June 6 and June 9, 2025, by 11:59 PM ET. The resolution depends on credible reporting confirming a voice-based conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. Let's go through each one to see if there's any mention of a direct conversation between Trump and Musk during that timeframe.\n\nLooking at the search results:\n\n1. **Result [1]**: From June 6, Trump mentions he's not interested in talking to Musk and has no call scheduled. Musk's father suggests cooling things down, but no direct conversation is mentioned.\n2. **Result [2]**: June 7 press gaggle on Air Force One. Trump is asked if he plans to speak with Musk. He says he hasn't thought about it and is busy with other matters. No indication of a call happening.\n3. **Result [3]**: June 9 article. Trump says he doesn't mind a call but has no plans to initiate. White House press secretary confirms no plans for talks in coming days.\n4. **Result [4]**: June 6 CBS article. Mentions the feud but no direct conversation. Trump says he's disappointed, Musk criticizes, but no call.\n5. **Result [5]**: June 7 NBC video. Discusses the feud's escalation, no mention of a call.\n6. **Result [6]**: June 9 Axios article. Trump says he assumes the relationship is over and has no desire to reconcile. No call mentioned.\n7. **Result [7]**: June 8 TIME article. Musk floats a new party idea, no mention of a call with Trump.\n8. **Result [8]**: March 12 video. Old event, outside the date range.\n9. **Result [9]**: June 6 Politico article. White House aides planned a call for June 7, but no confirmation if it happened.\n10. **Result [10]**: June 6 Politico. GOP hopes for d\u00e9tente, but no confirmation of a call.\n11. **Result [11]**: June 7 Politico. Trump says he's not thinking about Musk and has no plans to speak.\n12. **Result [12]**: June 7 Politico. Discusses fallout, no call mentioned.\n13. **Result [13]**: April 2 Politico. Old news about Musk stepping back, irrelevant dates.\n14. **Result [14]**: Independent article. Focuses on drug allegations, no call info.\n15. **Result [15]**: June 9 ANI video. Trump says he hasn't thought about speaking to Musk and wishes him well. No call.\n16. **Result [16]**: June 7 CBS. Musk sought a call, but source says it didn't happen.\n17. **Result [17]**: June 7 StreetInsider. Reuters source says Trump not interested in talking.\n18. **Result [18]**: June 6 Ynet. White House source says no call expected.\n19. **Result [19]**: June 10 CNN-News18. Trump says he might move Tesla but keeps Starlink. No mention of a call.\n\nFrom all these, the key points are:\n- Trump repeatedly states he has no plans to call Musk and isn't interested.\n- White House sources confirm no planned calls.\n- Musk sought a call (result 16), but no credible report confirms it happened.\n- All articles up to June 10 (current date in the context) indicate no direct conversation occurred between June 6-9.\n\nTherefore, the resolution should be \"No\" (p1). The evidence from multiple sources aligns, and there's no credible reporting of a direct voice conversation within the specified timeframe.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.

The user wants to know if Trump and Musk spoke directly between June 6 and June 9, 2025, by 11:59 PM ET. The resolution depends on credible reporting confirming a voice-based conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. Let's go through each one to see if there's any mention of a direct conversation between Trump and Musk during that timeframe.\n\nLooking at the search results:\n\n1. **Result [1]**: From June 6, Trump mentions he's not interested in talking to Musk and has no call scheduled. Musk's father suggests cooling things down, but no direct conversation is mentioned.\n2. **Result [2]**: June 7 press gaggle on Air Force One. Trump is asked if he plans to speak with Musk. He says he hasn't thought about it and is busy with other matters. No indication of a call happening.\n3. **Result [3]**: June 9 article. Trump says he doesn't mind a call but has no plans to initiate. White House press secretary confirms no plans for talks in coming days.\n4. **Result [4]**: June 6 CBS article. Mentions the feud but no direct conversation. Trump says he's disappointed, Musk criticizes, but no call.\n5. **Result [5]**: June 7 NBC video. Discusses the feud's escalation, no mention of a call.\n6. **Result [6]**: June 9 Axios article. Trump says he assumes the relationship is over and has no desire to reconcile. No call mentioned.\n7. **Result [7]**: June 8 TIME article. Musk floats a new party idea, no mention of a call with Trump.\n8. **Result [8]**: March 12 video. Old event, outside the date range.\n9. **Result [9]**: June 6 Politico article. White House aides planned a call for June 7, but no confirmation if it happened.\n10. **Result [10]**: June 6 Politico. GOP hopes for d\u00e9tente, but no confirmation of a call.\n11. **Result [11]**: June 7 Politico. Trump says he's not thinking about Musk and has no plans to speak.\n12. **Result [12]**: June 7 Politico. Discusses fallout, no call mentioned.\n13. **Result [13]**: April 2 Politico. Old news about Musk stepping back, irrelevant dates.\n14. **Result [14]**: Independent article. Focuses on drug allegations, no call info.\n15. **Result [15]**: June 9 ANI video. Trump says he hasn't thought about speaking to Musk and wishes him well. No call.\n16. **Result [16]**: June 7 CBS. Musk sought a call, but source says it didn't happen.\n17. **Result [17]**: June 7 StreetInsider. Reuters source says Trump not interested in talking.\n18. **Result [18]**: June 6 Ynet. White House source says no call expected.\n19. **Result [19]**: June 10 CNN-News18. Trump says he might move Tesla but keeps Starlink. No mention of a call.\n\nFrom all these, the key points are:\n- Trump repeatedly states he has no plans to call Musk and isn't interested.\n- White House sources confirm no planned calls.\n- Musk sought a call (result 16), but no credible report confirms it happened.\n- All articles up to June 10 (current date in the context) indicate no direct conversation occurred between June 6-9.\n\nTherefore, the resolution should be \"No\" (p1). The evidence from multiple sources aligns, and there's no credible reporting of a direct voice conversation within the specified timeframe.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0, ID: 24837501808216531375647280066956405149962797458599112424864479942979321607891, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 1, ID: 39305273131551424254017781432125655290217577631980718893672717506923078798205, Winner: Yes\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
