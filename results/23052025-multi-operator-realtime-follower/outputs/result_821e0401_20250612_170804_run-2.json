      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the G2 vs. 3DMAX match at the BLAST.tv Austin Major on June 12, 2025. The resolution depends on who wins the round 1 match. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The given timestamp is June 12, 2025, 17:06:10 UTC. The match is scheduled for June 12 at 12:15 PM ET, which is 16:15 UTC. Since the current time is 17:06 UTC, the match has already taken place. So, it's not a future event anymore. \n\nNext, I need to verify the outcome of the match. The search results provided include several sources. Let's look through them. \n\nSearch result [1] from egamersworld.com mentions the head-to-head history between G2 and 3DMAX, but it's about upcoming matches and their history. However, the URL includes \"EyPMx1WrunHu\" which might be a specific match ID. The content shows a recent match where G2 lost to 3DMAX 5-13 in the BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025. Wait, looking at the \"Head to Head\" section in [1], it lists a match at BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025 where 3DMAX won 5-13. That seems like the result we need.\n\nSearch result [2] from strafe.com states the match is on June 12, 2025, at 4:15 PM (which aligns with the user's 12:15 PM ET time). It mentions their previous encounters, but the last match was on May 21, 2025, where G2 won. However, the current match's prediction was 53.5% for G2. But the actual result isn't directly mentioned here. \n\nSearch result [15] from escorenews.com details a previous match on May 21, 2025, where G2 won 13-3 on Inferno. But that's an older match. \n\nSearch result [16] from egamersworld.com specifically mentions the June 12 match. It states that the winner was G2 Esports with a score of 5:13. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, in the \"About the match\" section, it says \"The winner of the Counter-Strike (CS2) match was the team G2 Esports with the score 5:13\". Wait, that score doesn't make sense because in CS:GO, a BO1 match is typically 16 rounds. A score of 5-13 would mean 3DMAX won. But the text says G2 won. That's confusing. Maybe a typo? Let me check again. \n\nLooking at [16], under \"About the match\": \"The winner of the Counter-Strike (CS2) match was the team G2 Esports with the score 5:13 and lasted 0 h, 47 m.\" That seems contradictory. If the score is 5-13, then 3DMAX won, but the text says G2 won. This could be an error in the source. \n\nLooking back at [1], in the \"Head to Head\" section, there's an entry for BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025 where 3DMAX won 5-13. That would mean 3DMAX won that match. \n\nSearch result [8] from blast.tv mentions that 3DMAX advanced to stage 3 by defeating FaZe, but that's a different match. \n\nWait, the user's query is about G2 vs. 3DMAX on June 12. The key sources are [1] and [16]. [1] clearly states in the head-to-head that at BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025, 3DMAX won 5-13. [16] has conflicting info where it says G2 won but the score is 5-13. Given that [1] is more recent and specific to their head-to-head, and considering that in CS:GO, a score of 13-5 would mean one team reached 13 rounds first. So if 3DMAX won 13-5, that's a win for them. \n\nHowever, the user's ancillary data says p1 is 3DMAX, p2 is G2. So if 3DMAX won, the resolution is p1. But need to confirm the actual result. \n\nAnother source, [14] from GosuGamers, just lists the match as upcoming. [12] from bo3.gg also lists it as upcoming but no result. \n\nWait, the current timestamp is June 12, 2025, 17:06 UTC, which is after the match time (16:15 UTC). So the match has concluded. The most reliable source here is [1], which in the head-to-head section lists the BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025 match as a 3DMAX win with a score of 5-13. Assuming that's the correct result, then 3DMAX won, so the resolution should be p1. \n\nHowever, there's confusion in [16] where it says G2 won with a 5-13 score, which is likely a typo. The correct interpretation is that 3DMAX won 13-5. Therefore, the market resolves to p1 (3DMAX). \n\nBut wait, the user's resolution conditions have p2 as G2. So if 3DMAX won, it's p1. The sources indicate 3DMAX won, so the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749747970 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-12 17:06:10 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the G2 vs. 3DMAX match at the BLAST.tv Austin Major on June 12, 2025. The resolution depends on who wins the round 1 match. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The given timestamp is June 12, 2025, 17:06:10 UTC. The match is scheduled for June 12 at 12:15 PM ET, which is 16:15 UTC. Since the current time is 17:06 UTC, the match has already taken place. So, it's not a future event anymore. \n\nNext, I need to verify the outcome of the match. The search results provided include several sources. Let's look through them. \n\nSearch result [1] from egamersworld.com mentions the head-to-head history between G2 and 3DMAX, but it's about upcoming matches and their history. However, the URL includes \"EyPMx1WrunHu\" which might be a specific match ID. The content shows a recent match where G2 lost to 3DMAX 5-13 in the BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025. Wait, looking at the \"Head to Head\" section in [1], it lists a match at BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025 where 3DMAX won 5-13. That seems like the result we need.\n\nSearch result [2] from strafe.com states the match is on June 12, 2025, at 4:15 PM (which aligns with the user's 12:15 PM ET time). It mentions their previous encounters, but the last match was on May 21, 2025, where G2 won. However, the current match's prediction was 53.5% for G2. But the actual result isn't directly mentioned here. \n\nSearch result [15] from escorenews.com details a previous match on May 21, 2025, where G2 won 13-3 on Inferno. But that's an older match. \n\nSearch result [16] from egamersworld.com specifically mentions the June 12 match. It states that the winner was G2 Esports with a score of 5:13. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, in the \"About the match\" section, it says \"The winner of the Counter-Strike (CS2) match was the team G2 Esports with the score 5:13\". Wait, that score doesn't make sense because in CS:GO, a BO1 match is typically 16 rounds. A score of 5-13 would mean 3DMAX won. But the text says G2 won. That's confusing. Maybe a typo? Let me check again. \n\nLooking at [16], under \"About the match\": \"The winner of the Counter-Strike (CS2) match was the team G2 Esports with the score 5:13 and lasted 0 h, 47 m.\" That seems contradictory. If the score is 5-13, then 3DMAX won, but the text says G2 won. This could be an error in the source. \n\nLooking back at [1], in the \"Head to Head\" section, there's an entry for BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025 where 3DMAX won 5-13. That would mean 3DMAX won that match. \n\nSearch result [8] from blast.tv mentions that 3DMAX advanced to stage 3 by defeating FaZe, but that's a different match. \n\nWait, the user's query is about G2 vs. 3DMAX on June 12. The key sources are [1] and [16]. [1] clearly states in the head-to-head that at BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025, 3DMAX won 5-13. [16] has conflicting info where it says G2 won but the score is 5-13. Given that [1] is more recent and specific to their head-to-head, and considering that in CS:GO, a score of 13-5 would mean one team reached 13 rounds first. So if 3DMAX won 13-5, that's a win for them. \n\nHowever, the user's ancillary data says p1 is 3DMAX, p2 is G2. So if 3DMAX won, the resolution is p1. But need to confirm the actual result. \n\nAnother source, [14] from GosuGamers, just lists the match as upcoming. [12] from bo3.gg also lists it as upcoming but no result. \n\nWait, the current timestamp is June 12, 2025, 17:06 UTC, which is after the match time (16:15 UTC). So the match has concluded. The most reliable source here is [1], which in the head-to-head section lists the BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025 match as a 3DMAX win with a score of 5-13. Assuming that's the correct result, then 3DMAX won, so the resolution should be p1. \n\nHowever, there's confusion in [16] where it says G2 won with a 5-13 score, which is likely a typo. The correct interpretation is that 3DMAX won 13-5. Therefore, the market resolves to p1 (3DMAX). \n\nBut wait, the user's resolution conditions have p2 as G2. So if 3DMAX won, it's p1. The sources indicate 3DMAX won, so the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: G2, Price: 0.015, ID: 48853652963293305091280479117806519536735293595520005093936555061228908926931, Winner: No\n- Token: 3DMAX, Price: 0.985, ID: 74258981749784128713325322642814633526158400386037871029795476828933860975789, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to 3DMAX, p2 to G2, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = 3DMAX, p2 = G2\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors 3DMAX outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.985 = 98.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
