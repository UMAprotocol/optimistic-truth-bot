Try other solvers or a combination approach.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: perplexity\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump will say \"Newscum\" between June 14 and June 20, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he mentions it verbally in a recorded and publicly accessible audio or video. Written mentions, like on Truth Social, don't count. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided for any instances of Trump using \"Newscum\" verbally during that timeframe. Let's look through each source.\n\nSearch result [1] from ABC News mentions Trump calling Newsom \"Newscum\" in a social media post on June 10, but that's a written statement, so it doesn't count. The article also references a press conference on June 10 where Trump was asked about arresting Newsom, but there's no mention of him saying \"Newscum\" verbally there.\n\nResult [2] is a YouTube video from Sky News Australia dated June 12, 2025. The transcript shows Trump posted on Truth Social attacking \"Gavin Newscum.\" Again, that's a written post, not a verbal mention.\n\nResult [3] is a transcript of Trump's speech at the Army parade on June 14. He doesn't mention \"Newscum\" here; the speech is about the military and history.\n\nResult [4] from CBS News on June 17 mentions Trump leaving the G7 early but doesn't reference any verbal use of \"Newscum.\"\n\nResult [5] is an interview from April 25, which is outside the timeframe, so irrelevant.\n\nResult [6] is a video of Trump addressing West Point on May 24, also outside the date range.\n\nResult [7] from Politico on June 18 quotes Trump talking about Iran. No mention of \"Newscum.\"\n\nResult [8] discusses Trump's June schedule but doesn't include any verbal mentions of the term.\n\nResult [9] covers protests on June 14 but no relevant Trump statements.\n\nResult [10] is about a lawsuit and mentions Trump using \"Newscum\" in the past, but no specific dates within the window.\n\nResult [11] is a YouTube interview with Newsom where he discusses Trump's written attacks, but no verbal instances.\n\nResult [12] from June 13 mentions Trump's social media posts, which are written.\n\nResult [13] from June 16 talks about their feud but no verbal mentions.\n\nResult [14] is a wiki page, not relevant.\n\nResult [15] from June 10 shows Newsom trolling Trump over a Truth Social post, which is written.\n\nResult [16] from June 12 quotes Newsom saying Trump called him \"Newscum\" on social media, again written.\n\nResult [17] is a transcript from June 17 at the G7. Trump speaks with the UK PM but doesn't mention \"Newscum.\"\n\nAfter reviewing all sources, there's no evidence of Trump verbally saying \"Newscum\" between June 14 and June 20. All instances are written on Truth Social or other platforms, which don't count per the resolution conditions. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750265309 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-18 16:48:29 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump will say \"Newscum\" between June 14 and June 20, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he mentions it verbally in a recorded and publicly accessible audio or video. Written mentions, like on Truth Social, don't count. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided for any instances of Trump using \"Newscum\" verbally during that timeframe. Let's look through each source.\n\nSearch result [1] from ABC News mentions Trump calling Newsom \"Newscum\" in a social media post on June 10, but that's a written statement, so it doesn't count. The article also references a press conference on June 10 where Trump was asked about arresting Newsom, but there's no mention of him saying \"Newscum\" verbally there.\n\nResult [2] is a YouTube video from Sky News Australia dated June 12, 2025. The transcript shows Trump posted on Truth Social attacking \"Gavin Newscum.\" Again, that's a written post, not a verbal mention.\n\nResult [3] is a transcript of Trump's speech at the Army parade on June 14. He doesn't mention \"Newscum\" here; the speech is about the military and history.\n\nResult [4] from CBS News on June 17 mentions Trump leaving the G7 early but doesn't reference any verbal use of \"Newscum.\"\n\nResult [5] is an interview from April 25, which is outside the timeframe, so irrelevant.\n\nResult [6] is a video of Trump addressing West Point on May 24, also outside the date range.\n\nResult [7] from Politico on June 18 quotes Trump talking about Iran. No mention of \"Newscum.\"\n\nResult [8] discusses Trump's June schedule but doesn't include any verbal mentions of the term.\n\nResult [9] covers protests on June 14 but no relevant Trump statements.\n\nResult [10] is about a lawsuit and mentions Trump using \"Newscum\" in the past, but no specific dates within the window.\n\nResult [11] is a YouTube interview with Newsom where he discusses Trump's written attacks, but no verbal instances.\n\nResult [12] from June 13 mentions Trump's social media posts, which are written.\n\nResult [13] from June 16 talks about their feud but no verbal mentions.\n\nResult [14] is a wiki page, not relevant.\n\nResult [15] from June 10 shows Newsom trolling Trump over a Truth Social post, which is written.\n\nResult [16] from June 12 quotes Newsom saying Trump called him \"Newscum\" on social media, again written.\n\nResult [17] is a transcript from June 17 at the G7. Trump speaks with the UK PM but doesn't mention \"Newscum.\"\n\nAfter reviewing all sources, there's no evidence of Trump verbally saying \"Newscum\" between June 14 and June 20. All instances are written on Truth Social or other platforms, which don't count per the resolution conditions. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.9815, ID: 58299458812060986306720889995214151091596269636870334826600674329626753624584, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.0185, ID: 56207775057492295831473644926476158092686026606523737447993649453092298052906, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.982 = 98.2% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump will say \"Newscum\" between June 14 and June 20, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he mentions it verbally in a recorded audio or video that's publicly accessible. Written mentions, like on Truth Social, don't count.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided for any instances of Trump saying \"Newscum\" during that timeframe. The current date given is June 18, 2025, so the period in question is from June 14 to June 20. \n\nLooking through the search results, several sources mention Trump using the term \"Newscum\" referring to Gavin Newsom. For example, result [4] from June 13, 2025, is a YouTube video titled \"Trump attacks Gavin 'Newscum' on Truth Social\" where he posted on Truth Social. However, written posts don't count. \n\nResult [12] is another YouTube video from June 13, 2025, where Trump is quoted on Truth Social again. Still, that's written. \n\nResult [21] is the same as [12], so same issue. \n\nResult [25] from June 12, 2025, mentions Trump's Truth Social post using \"Newscum.\" Again, written. \n\nResult [27] from June 12, 2025, quotes Trump's Truth Social post. \n\nResult [33] is a transcript from June 15, 2025, of Trump's speech at a military parade. I need to check if he said \"Newscum\" there. The transcript doesn't show him using that term. \n\nResult [35] is a video of Trump speaking at the military parade on June 14. The transcript provided doesn't include \"Newscum.\" \n\nResult [38] is a White House article about the military parade, no mention of the term. \n\nResult [49] is another YouTube video from June 13, 2025, but again, it's a Truth Social post. \n\nResult [52] is a video from June 17, 2025, where Trump leaves the G7 summit early. No mention of \"Newscum\" in the provided transcript. \n\nResult [68] is another mention of the G7 summit departure, no relevant term. \n\nResult [70] is a video from June 17, 2025, where Trump rants at the G7, but the transcript doesn't include \"Newscum.\" \n\nWait, result [4] and others mention Trump's posts on Truth Social, but those are written. The user specified verbal mentions. Are there any instances where Trump actually spoke the word \"Newscum\" in a video or audio recording during the specified dates?\n\nLooking at result [22], a Fox News article from June 13, 2025, quotes Newsom saying Trump called him \"Newscum\" again, but it's unclear if that's from a verbal statement or a written post. The article mentions Trump's social media posts, which are written. \n\nResult [53] from June 13, 2025, is an article where Newsom accuses Trump of lying about their conversation. Newsom says Trump called him \"Newscum\" again, but the context is a phone conversation. However, unless that phone conversation was recorded and publicly accessible, it wouldn't count. \n\nResult [54] is an article from June 15, 2025, mentioning Trump's nickname but doesn't specify a verbal mention. \n\nResult [64] is an IMDb article from 2024, outside the timeframe. \n\nResult [65] from June 16, 2025, discusses the feud but doesn't mention a verbal instance. \n\nResult [71] is a video from June 17, 2025, but the transcript doesn't include the term. \n\nSo, based on the provided search results, there's no clear evidence of Trump verbally saying \"Newscum\" in a recorded and publicly accessible video or audio between June 14 and June 18 (current date). However, the user's query includes up to June 20. The current data only goes up to June 18. \n\nBut according to the search results, all instances of \"Newscum\" are from written posts on Truth Social, not verbal mentions. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). However, the user's personalization instructions mention that if the event date is in the past (relative to the current timestamp of June 18, 2025), and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome. Since the period is June 14-20, and today is June 18, there are still two days left. But the user's current timestamp is June 18, so the system can only consider up to that date. \n\nWait, the current timestamp given is June 18, 2025, 4:52:19 PM UTC. The query's end date is June 20. However, the system's knowledge cutoff is the provided search results, which go up to June 17. The latest result is [70] from June 17. There's no data beyond that. \n\nGiven the available data up to June 17, there's no verbal mention. Therefore, unless there's a verbal instance in the remaining days (June 19-20), which isn't covered in the search results, the answer would be \"No\". But since the market hasn't closed yet (ends June 20), but the current timestamp is June 18, the system has to resolve based on available info. \n\nHowever, the user's personalization says if the event is scheduled for a future date relative to the current timestamp, return p4. But the event period includes dates both past and future relative to June 18. Since part of the period is in the future (June 19-20), but part has already occurred (June 14-18), and there's no verbal mention in the past dates, but the future dates are unknown, the resolution would depend on whether any verbal mentions occurred in the past part. Since there are none, and the future is uncertain, but the market resolves based on the entire period. However, the system can only use the provided data up to June 17. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided data, there's no verbal mention, so the resolution should be \"No\" (p1). But need to check if any of the search results have a verbal mention. \n\nWait, result [4] is a YouTube video titled \"Trump attacks Gavin 'Newscum' on Truth Social\" from June 13. The description says Trump posted on Truth Social, which is written. The video might include Trump speaking, but the transcript provided in the search result doesn't mention him saying \"Newscum\" verbally. The same applies to other videos. Without explicit evidence of a verbal mention in the provided transcripts, it's considered written. \n\nTherefore, the answer is \"No\" (p1).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750265309 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-18 16:48:29 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Re-evaluate the sources and check for any new evidence or updates that might have been missed in the initial analysis.

The user wants to know if Donald Trump will say \"Newscum\" between June 14 and June 20, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he mentions it verbally in a recorded audio or video that's publicly accessible. Written mentions, like on Truth Social, don't count.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided for any instances of Trump saying \"Newscum\" during that timeframe. The current date given is June 18, 2025, so the period in question is from June 14 to June 20. \n\nLooking through the search results, several sources mention Trump using the term \"Newscum\" referring to Gavin Newsom. For example, result [4] from June 13, 2025, is a YouTube video titled \"Trump attacks Gavin 'Newscum' on Truth Social\" where he posted on Truth Social. However, written posts don't count. \n\nResult [12] is another YouTube video from June 13, 2025, where Trump is quoted on Truth Social again. Still, that's written. \n\nResult [21] is the same as [12], so same issue. \n\nResult [25] from June 12, 2025, mentions Trump's Truth Social post using \"Newscum.\" Again, written. \n\nResult [27] from June 12, 2025, quotes Trump's Truth Social post. \n\nResult [33] is a transcript from June 15, 2025, of Trump's speech at a military parade. I need to check if he said \"Newscum\" there. The transcript doesn't show him using that term. \n\nResult [35] is a video of Trump speaking at the military parade on June 14. The transcript provided doesn't include \"Newscum.\" \n\nResult [38] is a White House article about the military parade, no mention of the term. \n\nResult [49] is another YouTube video from June 13, 2025, but again, it's a Truth Social post. \n\nResult [52] is a video from June 17, 2025, where Trump leaves the G7 summit early. No mention of \"Newscum\" in the provided transcript. \n\nResult [68] is another mention of the G7 summit departure, no relevant term. \n\nResult [70] is a video from June 17, 2025, where Trump rants at the G7, but the transcript doesn't include \"Newscum.\" \n\nWait, result [4] and others mention Trump's posts on Truth Social, but those are written. The user specified verbal mentions. Are there any instances where Trump actually spoke the word \"Newscum\" in a video or audio recording during the specified dates?\n\nLooking at result [22], a Fox News article from June 13, 2025, quotes Newsom saying Trump called him \"Newscum\" again, but it's unclear if that's from a verbal statement or a written post. The article mentions Trump's social media posts, which are written. \n\nResult [53] from June 13, 2025, is an article where Newsom accuses Trump of lying about their conversation. Newsom says Trump called him \"Newscum\" again, but the context is a phone conversation. However, unless that phone conversation was recorded and publicly accessible, it wouldn't count. \n\nResult [54] is an article from June 15, 2025, mentioning Trump's nickname but doesn't specify a verbal mention. \n\nResult [64] is an IMDb article from 2024, outside the timeframe. \n\nResult [65] from June 16, 2025, discusses the feud but doesn't mention a verbal instance. \n\nResult [71] is a video from June 17, 2025, but the transcript doesn't include the term. \n\nSo, based on the provided search results, there's no clear evidence of Trump verbally saying \"Newscum\" in a recorded and publicly accessible video or audio between June 14 and June 18 (current date). However, the user's query includes up to June 20. The current data only goes up to June 18. \n\nBut according to the search results, all instances of \"Newscum\" are from written posts on Truth Social, not verbal mentions. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). However, the user's personalization instructions mention that if the event date is in the past (relative to the current timestamp of June 18, 2025), and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome. Since the period is June 14-20, and today is June 18, there are still two days left. But the user's current timestamp is June 18, so the system can only consider up to that date. \n\nWait, the current timestamp given is June 18, 2025, 4:52:19 PM UTC. The query's end date is June 20. However, the system's knowledge cutoff is the provided search results, which go up to June 17. The latest result is [70] from June 17. There's no data beyond that. \n\nGiven the available data up to June 17, there's no verbal mention. Therefore, unless there's a verbal instance in the remaining days (June 19-20), which isn't covered in the search results, the answer would be \"No\". But since the market hasn't closed yet (ends June 20), but the current timestamp is June 18, the system has to resolve based on available info. \n\nHowever, the user's personalization says if the event is scheduled for a future date relative to the current timestamp, return p4. But the event period includes dates both past and future relative to June 18. Since part of the period is in the future (June 19-20), but part has already occurred (June 14-18), and there's no verbal mention in the past dates, but the future dates are unknown, the resolution would depend on whether any verbal mentions occurred in the past part. Since there are none, and the future is uncertain, but the market resolves based on the entire period. However, the system can only use the provided data up to June 17. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided data, there's no verbal mention, so the resolution should be \"No\" (p1). But need to check if any of the search results have a verbal mention. \n\nWait, result [4] is a YouTube video titled \"Trump attacks Gavin 'Newscum' on Truth Social\" from June 13. The description says Trump posted on Truth Social, which is written. The video might include Trump speaking, but the transcript provided in the search result doesn't mention him saying \"Newscum\" verbally. The same applies to other videos. Without explicit evidence of a verbal mention in the provided transcripts, it's considered written. \n\nTherefore, the answer is \"No\" (p1).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.9815, ID: 58299458812060986306720889995214151091596269636870334826600674329626753624584, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.0185, ID: 56207775057492295831473644926476158092686026606523737447993649453092298052906, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.982 = 98.2% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump will say \"Newscum\" between June 14 and June 20, 2025. The resolution depends on verbal mentions in recorded, publicly accessible audio or video. Written statements like Truth Social posts don't count.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The provided timestamp is June 18, 2025, 4:48 PM UTC. The market's time frame is from June 14, 12:00 AM ET to June 20, 11:59 PM ET. So we're in the middle of that period now.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are several mentions of Trump using \"Newscum\" in Truth Social posts and other written contexts. For example, sources [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [60], [61], [62] all reference Trump using \"Newscum\" in various contexts, but most are written posts or articles quoting his written statements.\n\nHowever, the key is verbal mentions. The user specified that written usages don't count. So I need to look for instances where Trump verbally said \"Newscum\" in a recorded video or audio during the specified dates.\n\nLooking through the search results, there are mentions of Trump's press conferences and interviews. For example, source [6] mentions Trump speaking on Truth Social about Newsom's response to the LA riots on June 8, 2025, but that's before the market's start date. Source [8] from June 13, 2025, has Trump posting on Truth Social, but again, that's written. Source [18] from June 13, 2025, also refers to a Truth Social post. \n\nSource [42] is a YouTube video titled \"Trump attacks Gavin 'Newscum' on Truth Social\" from June 13, 2025. However, the content describes Trump's written posts, not verbal mentions. Similarly, source [32] is another instance of a written post on June 13.\n\nSource [44] mentions Trump's interview on a podcast where he refers to Newsom as \"Newscum\" on June 13, 2025. If this interview was recorded and publicly accessible within the market's timeframe, that would count. However, the exact date of the interview needs to be verified. The current date is June 18, so if the interview happened on June 13, that's within the market's window (June 14-20). Wait, June 13 is before the start date. The market starts on June 14. So any mentions before June 14 don't count.\n\nLooking for mentions within June 14 to June 18 (current date). Source [50] from June 14, 2025, mentions Trump's Truth Social posts, which are written. Source [52] from June 8, 2025, is before the period. Source [56] from June 12, 2025, is also before. \n\nWait, the current date is June 18, 2025. The market's period is from June 14 to June 20. So any verbal mentions from June 14 onwards need to be checked. The search results provided go up to June 17, 2025 (source [53]). \n\nLooking at source [53], it's from June 17, 2025, and mentions Trump's Truth Social posts, which are written. Source [54] from June 13, 2025, is before the period. Source [56] from June 12, 2025, also before. \n\nThere's a mention in source [60] from June 12, 2025, which is before the period. \n\nI need to check if any of the search results include verbal mentions (video/audio) of Trump saying \"Newscum\" between June 14 and June 18. \n\nLooking at source [49], which is Truth Social posts from June 8, 2025, which is outside the window. Source [50] includes a June 14 post, but it's written. \n\nSource [58] is about a planned military parade on June 14, but no mention of verbal \"Newscum\". \n\nSource [62] is a video from May 19, 2025, which is before the period. \n\nNone of the search results provided indicate a verbal mention by Trump of \"Newscum\" within the specified dates (June 14-20). All instances are either written or before June 14. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided information up to June 18, there's no evidence of Trump verbally saying \"Newscum\" during the market's timeframe. However, since the market is still open until June 20, there's a possibility he might do so in the remaining days. But according to the current data, the answer would be \"No\" (p1). However, the user's personalization instructions say that if the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp (which is June 18), and no verifiable information is available, assume the most probable outcome. Since the current date is June 18, and the market ends on June 20, but the user is asking now (June 18), the event is ongoing. However, the user's instruction says if the event is scheduled for a future date or has not occurred yet, return p4. But the market is still ongoing. Wait, the current timestamp is June 18, 2025, and the market ends on June 20. The user is asking to resolve based on available information up to now. Since there's no mention in the search results of Trump verbally saying \"Newscum\" between June 14-18, and the remaining days are future, the resolution should be based on available data. If no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. Given Trump's pattern of using \"Newscum\" frequently in writing, but no verbal mentions in the current period, the resolution would be \"No\" (p1). But the user's instruction says if the event is in the past (relative to current timestamp), but no info, assume probable outcome. Since the event is ongoing (still within the timeframe), but no info yet, the answer would be p4 (cannot resolve now). Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, and the event date is in the past... assume the most probable outcome.\" But the event is from June 14 to June 20, and the current date is June 18. So part of the event is in the past (June 14-18) and part is future (June 19-20). Since the user is asking now, on June 18, the event is ongoing. The instructions say if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp, return p4. But part of the event is in the past. However, the market is still open, so the user might need to wait. But the user is asking for a resolution based on the current data. Since the market hasn't closed yet, but the user wants a resolution now, the ancillary data says to resolve based on the conditions. If there's no verifiable info of Trump saying \"Newscum\" verbally between June 14-18, and the remaining days are future, the resolution would be \"No\" unless there's evidence. But according to the instructions, if the event is ongoing and no info, it's p4. However, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp... assume the most probable outcome.\" Since part of the event is in the past (June 14-18) and part future (19-20), but the user is asking on June 18, the event is not entirely in the past. Therefore, the correct response would be p4 (cannot resolve yet). But the user's instruction also says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp... ALWAYS return p4.\" Since the event is ongoing (part future), the answer is p4. However, the user's query is to resolve based on the current data. Wait, the user is acting as the UMA oracle, so they need to resolve based on verified facts up to now. If there's no verified verbal mentions from June 14-18, then the answer is \"No\" (p1), but if there's a possibility in the remaining days, it's p4. But according to the instructions, if the event is scheduled for a future date (even partially), return p4. Since the event is still ongoing (until June 20), the resolution should be p4. However, the user's personalization also says: \"If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.\" So even if part of the event is in the past, as long as part is in the future, it's considered a future event. Therefore, the resolution should be p4. But the user's query is to resolve now, based on the data up to now. The instructions are conflicting. The correct approach is: if the event has not yet concluded (i.e., there are future dates within the event window), then it's p4. But if the event has concluded (all dates in the past), then resolve based on available info. Since the current date is June 18 and the event ends on June 20, it's still ongoing. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750265309 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-18 16:48:29 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump will say \"Newscum\" between June 14 and June 20, 2025. The resolution depends on verbal mentions in recorded, publicly accessible audio or video. Written statements like Truth Social posts don't count.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The provided timestamp is June 18, 2025, 4:48 PM UTC. The market's time frame is from June 14, 12:00 AM ET to June 20, 11:59 PM ET. So we're in the middle of that period now.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are several mentions of Trump using \"Newscum\" in Truth Social posts and other written contexts. For example, sources [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [60], [61], [62] all reference Trump using \"Newscum\" in various contexts, but most are written posts or articles quoting his written statements.\n\nHowever, the key is verbal mentions. The user specified that written usages don't count. So I need to look for instances where Trump verbally said \"Newscum\" in a recorded video or audio during the specified dates.\n\nLooking through the search results, there are mentions of Trump's press conferences and interviews. For example, source [6] mentions Trump speaking on Truth Social about Newsom's response to the LA riots on June 8, 2025, but that's before the market's start date. Source [8] from June 13, 2025, has Trump posting on Truth Social, but again, that's written. Source [18] from June 13, 2025, also refers to a Truth Social post. \n\nSource [42] is a YouTube video titled \"Trump attacks Gavin 'Newscum' on Truth Social\" from June 13, 2025. However, the content describes Trump's written posts, not verbal mentions. Similarly, source [32] is another instance of a written post on June 13.\n\nSource [44] mentions Trump's interview on a podcast where he refers to Newsom as \"Newscum\" on June 13, 2025. If this interview was recorded and publicly accessible within the market's timeframe, that would count. However, the exact date of the interview needs to be verified. The current date is June 18, so if the interview happened on June 13, that's within the market's window (June 14-20). Wait, June 13 is before the start date. The market starts on June 14. So any mentions before June 14 don't count.\n\nLooking for mentions within June 14 to June 18 (current date). Source [50] from June 14, 2025, mentions Trump's Truth Social posts, which are written. Source [52] from June 8, 2025, is before the period. Source [56] from June 12, 2025, is also before. \n\nWait, the current date is June 18, 2025. The market's period is from June 14 to June 20. So any verbal mentions from June 14 onwards need to be checked. The search results provided go up to June 17, 2025 (source [53]). \n\nLooking at source [53], it's from June 17, 2025, and mentions Trump's Truth Social posts, which are written. Source [54] from June 13, 2025, is before the period. Source [56] from June 12, 2025, also before. \n\nThere's a mention in source [60] from June 12, 2025, which is before the period. \n\nI need to check if any of the search results include verbal mentions (video/audio) of Trump saying \"Newscum\" between June 14 and June 18. \n\nLooking at source [49], which is Truth Social posts from June 8, 2025, which is outside the window. Source [50] includes a June 14 post, but it's written. \n\nSource [58] is about a planned military parade on June 14, but no mention of verbal \"Newscum\". \n\nSource [62] is a video from May 19, 2025, which is before the period. \n\nNone of the search results provided indicate a verbal mention by Trump of \"Newscum\" within the specified dates (June 14-20). All instances are either written or before June 14. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided information up to June 18, there's no evidence of Trump verbally saying \"Newscum\" during the market's timeframe. However, since the market is still open until June 20, there's a possibility he might do so in the remaining days. But according to the current data, the answer would be \"No\" (p1). However, the user's personalization instructions say that if the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp (which is June 18), and no verifiable information is available, assume the most probable outcome. Since the current date is June 18, and the market ends on June 20, but the user is asking now (June 18), the event is ongoing. However, the user's instruction says if the event is scheduled for a future date or has not occurred yet, return p4. But the market is still ongoing. Wait, the current timestamp is June 18, 2025, and the market ends on June 20. The user is asking to resolve based on available information up to now. Since there's no mention in the search results of Trump verbally saying \"Newscum\" between June 14-18, and the remaining days are future, the resolution should be based on available data. If no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. Given Trump's pattern of using \"Newscum\" frequently in writing, but no verbal mentions in the current period, the resolution would be \"No\" (p1). But the user's instruction says if the event is in the past (relative to current timestamp), but no info, assume probable outcome. Since the event is ongoing (still within the timeframe), but no info yet, the answer would be p4 (cannot resolve now). Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, and the event date is in the past... assume the most probable outcome.\" But the event is from June 14 to June 20, and the current date is June 18. So part of the event is in the past (June 14-18) and part is future (June 19-20). Since the user is asking now, on June 18, the event is ongoing. The instructions say if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp, return p4. But part of the event is in the past. However, the market is still open, so the user might need to wait. But the user is asking for a resolution based on the current data. Since the market hasn't closed yet, but the user wants a resolution now, the ancillary data says to resolve based on the conditions. If there's no verifiable info of Trump saying \"Newscum\" verbally between June 14-18, and the remaining days are future, the resolution would be \"No\" unless there's evidence. But according to the instructions, if the event is ongoing and no info, it's p4. However, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp... assume the most probable outcome.\" Since part of the event is in the past (June 14-18) and part future (19-20), but the user is asking on June 18, the event is not entirely in the past.

Wait, the user is acting as the UMA oracle, so they need to resolve based on verified facts up to now. If there's no verified verbal mentions from June 14-18, then the answer is \"No\" (p1), but if there's a possibility in the remaining days, it's p4. But according to the instructions, if the event is scheduled for a future date (even partially), return p4. Since the event is still ongoing (until June 20), the resolution should be p4. However, the user's personalization also says: \"If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.\" So even if part of the event is in the past, as long as part is in the future, it's considered a future event. Therefore, the resolution should be p4. But the user's query is to resolve now, based on the data up to now. The instructions are conflicting. The correct approach is: if the event has not yet concluded (i.e., there are future dates within the event window), then it's p4. But if the event has concluded (all dates in the past), then resolve based on available info. Since the current date is June 18 and the event ends on June 20, it's still ongoing. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.9815, ID: 58299458812060986306720889995214151091596269636870334826600674329626753624584, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.0185, ID: 56207775057492295831473644926476158092686026606523737447993649453092298052906, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

The key here is to check all the provided search results for any mentions of Trump using the term verbally within that timeframe.\n\nFirst, I'll note the time frame: June 14 to June 20, 2025. The current date given is June 18, 2025, so the period isn't fully over yet. But based on the search results, we need to check up to the available data.\n\nLooking through the search results, several sources mention Trump using \"Newscum\" in various contexts. For example, search result [1] from June 13, 2025, shows Trump posted on Truth Social attacking \"Gavin Newscum.\" However, written posts don't count per the resolution conditions\u2014only verbal mentions recorded in audio or video.\n\nSearch result [8] is a video from June 17, 2025, where Trump speaks on Air Force One. The transcript isn't provided, but the title mentions he addresses various topics. If in that video he said \"Newscum,\" that would count. Similarly, search result [23] is a video from June 15, 2025, of Trump's speech at the military parade. The transcript in [19] and [24] doesn't show him using \"Newscum,\" but maybe in another part?\n\nWait, search result [22] from June 11, 2025, mentions Trump calling Newsom \"incompetent\" but doesn't specify \"Newscum\" verbally. Search result [25] from June 9, 2025, has Trump writing \"Gavin Newscum\" on social media, but again, written posts don't count.\n\nLooking at [33], a video from June 13, 2025, where Trump attacks \"Gavin Newscum\" on Truth Social. But that's a written post. The user needs verbal mentions. \n\nWait, search result [8] is a video on June 17, 2025, titled \"LIVE: President TRUMP Speaks Out on Air Force One | June 17, 2025.\" The description mentions he addresses various topics. If in that speech he used \"Newscum,\" that would be within the timeframe. However, the transcript provided in the search results doesn't include the exact words. The user might need to check the actual video content. But since the search results don't provide a transcript confirming the verbal use, we can't be certain.\n\nAnother angle: search result [58] is a podcast from June 10, 2025, where Newsom discusses Trump's actions. Not relevant. Search result [57] is a live video from June 12, 2025, discussing clashes, but no mention of Trump saying \"Newscum\" verbally.\n\nWait, search result [35] from June 9, 2025, mentions Trump's social media posts using \"Newscum,\" but again, written. Similarly, [59] is a repeat of earlier content.\n\nThe critical point is that all instances in the search results where Trump uses \"Newscum\" are written (Truth Social posts) except possibly the June 17 Air Force One gaggle. Without a transcript confirming he said it verbally, we can't confirm. The user's personalization instructions say to check if the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp (June 18, 2025). Since the market runs until June 20, there's still time, but based on available data up to June 18, there's no evidence of a verbal mention. However, the user added an instruction to consider strong market sentiment favoring 'Yes' and check for new info. \n\nWait, the search results include [8] which is a video on June 17. If in that video Trump verbally said \"Newscum,\" then it's a yes. But the provided transcript snippets don't show that. The user might need to verify the video content. Since the search results don't confirm a verbal mention within the timeframe, and written posts don't count, the resolution should be \"No\" unless there's a verbal mention found. \n\nHowever, the user's additional instruction says to consider strong market sentiment favoring 'Yes' and check for new insights. If there's a video within the timeframe where Trump says it, even if not explicitly in the provided snippets, the answer would be yes. But based on the given data, there's no explicit verbal mention. Therefore, the recommendation would be \"No\" (p1), but since the market is still open until June 20, and the current date is June 18, there's a possibility. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome. Since the query is about June 14-20, and today is June 18, the event is ongoing. But the user's system prompt says to answer based on provided search results.

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.982 = 98.2% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Your task is to analyze the provided query and decide which AI solver is best suited to handle it.\n\nAvailable solvers: code_runner\n\nSolver descriptions:\n- perplexity: Uses the Perplexity AI search engine to find information online to answer general questions. Best for:\n  * Historical data and events\n  * General knowledge questions requiring context\n  * Questions needing interpretation of complex information\n  * Has knowledge cutoff and may not have very recent information\n\n- code_runner: Executes code to fetch real-time data from specific APIs. Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Currently available data sources based on API keys:\n    - MLB (Major League Baseball) data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Will Trump say \"Newscum\" this week?, description: This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Donald Trump mentions the listed term between June 14, 12:00 AM ET and June 20, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nPluralization/possessive of the word will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nInstances where the term is used in a compound word will count regardless of context (e.g. joyful is not a compound word for \"joy,\" however \"killjoy\" is a compounding of the words \"kill\" and \"joy\").\n\nA \u00e2\u0080\u0098mention' will include any verbal mention which is recorded (audio or video) and publicly accessible.\n\nWritten usages of terms (e.g. Truth Social posts, written statements, etc.) will not count toward this market's resolution.\n\nVideos posted on his social media which were filmed outside this market's time frame will not qualify for a \"Yes\" resolution. market_id: 552467\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe perplexity solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: perplexity\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750265309 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-18 16:48:29 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Re-evaluate the sources and check for any new evidence or updates that might have been missed in the initial analysis. Consider the possibility of verbal mentions that were not captured in the reviewed sources."
