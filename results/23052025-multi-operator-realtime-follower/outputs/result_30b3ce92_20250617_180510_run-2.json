      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if the @pumpdotfun X account will be unsuspended by Friday, June 20, 2025. The market resolution is based on whether the account is unsuspended between June 16, 4:20 PM ET and June 20, 11:59 PM ET. The primary source is the account itself, but credible reporting can also be used.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current status of the account. The search results mention that the suspension happened on June 16, and as of the latest info (June 17), the account is still suspended. The user's current timestamp is June 17, 2025, 6:01 PM UTC, which is 1:01 PM ET. So, the suspension is recent, and there's no indication yet of it being lifted.\n\nNext, I should look into the reasons for the suspension. The search results point to possible API misuse, specifically third-party APIs banned by X in January 2023. GMGN is mentioned as actively appealing, which suggests that the process might take some time. However, there's no official statement from X or Pump.fun about the reason or resolution timeline.\n\nThe user's ancillary data mentions that the market resolves to \"Yes\" if the account is unsuspended by June 20. Given that the suspension is part of a broader crackdown (as per the search results, 19+ accounts were suspended), X might be conducting a thorough review. Typically, appeals can take days to weeks, depending on the platform's policies and the complexity of the case.\n\nLooking at historical data, in February 2025, Pump.fun's account was hacked and later restored. That incident was resolved within a day, but that was a security breach, not a policy violation. The current situation is different; it's a policy violation, which might require more time to resolve.\n\nThe search results also mention that Pump.fun is preparing for a $1 billion token sale. The timing of the suspension is critical, and the team might be under pressure to resolve this quickly. However, X's process for appeals isn't transparent, and there's no guarantee of a swift resolution.\n\nConsidering all factors: the recent suspension, lack of official updates, typical appeal timelines, and the broader context of X's crackdown, it's uncertain whether the account will be unsuspended by June 20. The probability isn't high, but there's a possibility if the appeal is processed quickly. However, given the lack of information and the nature of the violation, the most probable outcome is that the account remains suspended, leading to a \"No\" resolution. But since there's no definitive information, the recommendation should be p3 (unknown/50-50) as per the ancillary data.\n</think>\n\n# Analysis of @pumpdotfun X Account Suspension and Potential Resolution by June 20, 2025  \n\nThe suspension of Pump.fun\u2019s official X account (@pumpdotfun) on June 16, 2025, has sparked significant speculation within the cryptocurrency community. This report evaluates the likelihood of the account being reinstated by June 20, 2025, based on available evidence, platform policies, and historical precedents.  \n\n---\n\n## **Context of the Suspension**  \nOn June 16, X (formerly Twitter) suspended @pumpdotfun and the personal account of co-founder Alon Cohen, along with 19+ other crypto-related accounts linked to platforms like GMGN, Bloom Trading, and BullX[1][2][8]. The suspensions occurred without explicit explanation, though X cited violations of its rules[1][5].  \n\n### **Key Factors Influencing the Suspension**  \n1. **Speculation on API Misuse**:  \n   - X banned third-party API usage in January 2023, requiring developers to pay for its official API (starting at $60,000/year)[1][4].  \n   - Users speculate that Pump.fun and others used unauthorized APIs to access X data, potentially to avoid costs or bypass restrictions[1][4][17].  \n   - GMGN confirmed it is \u201cactively appealing\u201d the suspension and working with X to resolve the issue[1][5].  \n\n2. **Regulatory and Operational Concerns**:  \n   - Pump.fun has faced legal challenges, including a January 2025 class-action lawsuit alleging it facilitated unregistered securities and pump-and-dump schemes[5][10].  \n   - The suspension coincides with Pump.fun\u2019s planned $1 billion token sale, raising questions about its impact on the launch[3][14].  \n\n3. **Platform Dependency and Community Impact**:  \n   - X remains a critical communication channel for crypto projects, with Pump.fun\u2019s suspension disrupting its marketing and user engagement[1][8].  \n   - The platform\u2019s website and core services (e.g., meme coin creation) remain operational, but social media visibility is diminished[2][3].  \n\n---\n\n## **Resolution Timeline and Probabilities**  \n### **Historical Precedents**  \n- **February 2025 Hack**: Pump.fun\u2019s X account was compromised to promote a fake $PUMP token, but control was restored within 24 hours[6][9][11]. This incident involved security breaches, not policy violations, and resolved swiftly due to external investigations[6][11].  \n- **GMGN\u2019s Appeal Process**: GMGN\u2019s suspension is part of the same crackdown, and its appeal is ongoing. No resolution timeline has been disclosed, suggesting a multi-day process[1][5].  \n\n### **Current Appeal Dynamics**  \n- **X\u2019s Appeal Process**: X typically requires users to submit appeals through its support portal. Resolutions can take days to weeks, depending on the complexity of the case[1][17].  \n- **Pump.fun\u2019s Response**: The team has not publicly commented on the suspension, but GMGN\u2019s proactive appeal indicates a structured effort to regain access[1][5].  \n\n### **Critical Uncertainties**  \n1. **Lack of Official Communication**:  \n   - X and Pump.fun have not provided details on the suspension\u2019s cause or resolution path, leaving the community reliant on speculation[1][8][10].  \n2. **Regulatory Overlap**:  \n   - Theories about SEC involvement or broader regulatory scrutiny remain unconfirmed, adding ambiguity to the timeline[2][10][17].  \n3. **API Policy Enforcement**:  \n   - If the suspension stems from API misuse, X may require Pump.fun to demonstrate compliance with its API policies before reinstatement[4][17].  \n\n---\n\n## **Probability Assessment**  \n### **Scenario 1: Account Reinstated by June 20 (p2: Yes)**  \n- **Conditions**:  \n  - X expedites the appeal process due to Pump.fun\u2019s prominence or external pressure.  \n  - The suspension is deemed a technical error or minor policy infraction.  \n- **Supporting Evidence**:  \n  - GMGN\u2019s appeal is ongoing, suggesting X may prioritize resolving high-profile cases[1][5].  \n  - Pump.fun\u2019s token sale and community pressure could incentivize a swift resolution[14][16].  \n\n### **Scenario 2: Account Remains Suspended (p1: No)**  \n- **Conditions**:  \n  - X requires Pump.fun to address systemic API misuse or other violations, delaying reinstatement.  \n  - The suspension is part of a broader regulatory or policy crackdown, extending beyond June 20.  \n- **Supporting Evidence**:  \n  - X\u2019s history of strict API enforcement and prolonged appeals for policy violations[4][17].  \n  - The lack of transparency from X or Pump.fun suggests a complex resolution process[8][10].  \n\n### **Scenario 3: Uncertain Outcome (p3: 50-50)**  \n- **Conditions**:  \n  - Insufficient information to confirm or refute reinstatement by June 20.  \n  - Mixed signals from X\u2019s enforcement patterns and Pump.fun\u2019s appeal progress.  \n\n---\n\n## **Recommendation**  \nGiven the lack of official updates, the complexity of X\u2019s appeal process, and the broader context of API policy enforcement, the most prudent resolution is **p3 (unknown/50-50)**. While Pump.fun\u2019s urgency to resolve the suspension ahead of its token sale may expedite the process, X\u2019s opaque policies and potential regulatory scrutiny introduce significant uncertainty.  \n\n**recommendation: p3**",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750183153 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-17 17:59:13 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if the @pumpdotfun X account will be unsuspended by Friday, June 20, 2025. The market resolution is based on whether the account is unsuspended between June 16, 4:20 PM ET and June 20, 11:59 PM ET. The primary source is the account itself, but credible reporting can also be used.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current status of the account. The search results mention that the suspension happened on June 16, and as of the latest info (June 17), the account is still suspended. The user's current timestamp is June 17, 2025, 6:01 PM UTC, which is 1:01 PM ET. So, the suspension is recent, and there's no indication yet of it being lifted.\n\nNext, I should look into the reasons for the suspension. The search results point to possible API misuse, specifically third-party APIs banned by X in January 2023. GMGN is mentioned as actively appealing, which suggests that the process might take some time. However, there's no official statement from X or Pump.fun about the reason or resolution timeline.\n\nThe user's ancillary data mentions that the market resolves to \"Yes\" if the account is unsuspended by June 20. Given that the suspension is part of a broader crackdown (as per the search results, 19+ accounts were suspended), X might be conducting a thorough review. Typically, appeals can take days to weeks, depending on the platform's policies and the complexity of the case.\n\nLooking at historical data, in February 2025, Pump.fun's account was hacked and later restored. That incident was resolved within a day, but that was a security breach, not a policy violation. The current situation is different; it's a policy violation, which might require more time to resolve.\n\nThe search results also mention that Pump.fun is preparing for a $1 billion token sale. The timing of the suspension is critical, and the team might be under pressure to resolve this quickly. However, X's process for appeals isn't transparent, and there's no guarantee of a swift resolution.\n\nConsidering all factors: the recent suspension, lack of official updates, typical appeal timelines, and the broader context of X's crackdown, it's uncertain whether the account will be unsuspended by June 20. The probability isn't high, but there's a possibility if the appeal is processed quickly. However, given the lack of information and the nature of the violation, the most probable outcome is that the account remains suspended, leading to a \"No\" resolution. But since there's no definitive information, the recommendation should be p3 (unknown/50-50) as per the ancillary data.\n</think>\n\n# Analysis of @pumpdotfun X Account Suspension and Potential Resolution by June 20, 2025  \n\nThe suspension of Pump.fun\u2019s official X account (@pumpdotfun) on June 16, 2025, has sparked significant speculation within the cryptocurrency community. This report evaluates the likelihood of the account being reinstated by June 20, 2025, based on available evidence, platform policies, and historical precedents.  \n\n---\n\n## **Context of the Suspension**  \nOn June 16, X (formerly Twitter) suspended @pumpdotfun and the personal account of co-founder Alon Cohen, along with 19+ other crypto-related accounts linked to platforms like GMGN, Bloom Trading, and BullX[1][2][8]. The suspensions occurred without explicit explanation, though X cited violations of its rules[1][5].  \n\n### **Key Factors Influencing the Suspension**  \n1. **Speculation on API Misuse**:  \n   - X banned third-party API usage in January 2023, requiring developers to pay for its official API (starting at $60,000/year)[1][4].  \n   - Users speculate that Pump.fun and others used unauthorized APIs to access X data, potentially to avoid costs or bypass restrictions[1][4][17].  \n   - GMGN confirmed it is \u201cactively appealing\u201d the suspension and working with X to resolve the issue[1][5].  \n\n2. **Regulatory and Operational Concerns**:  \n   - Pump.fun has faced legal challenges, including a January 2025 class-action lawsuit alleging it facilitated unregistered securities and pump-and-dump schemes[5][10].  \n   - The suspension coincides with Pump.fun\u2019s planned $1 billion token sale, raising questions about its impact on the launch[3][14].  \n\n3. **Platform Dependency and Community Impact**:  \n   - X remains a critical communication channel for crypto projects, with Pump.fun\u2019s suspension disrupting its marketing and user engagement[1][8].  \n   - The platform\u2019s website and core services (e.g., meme coin creation) remain operational, but social media visibility is diminished[2][3].  \n\n---\n\n## **Resolution Timeline and Probabilities**  \n### **Historical Precedents**  \n- **February 2025 Hack**: Pump.fun\u2019s X account was compromised to promote a fake $PUMP token, but control was restored within 24 hours[6][9][11]. This incident involved security breaches, not policy violations, and resolved swiftly due to external investigations[6][11].  \n- **GMGN\u2019s Appeal Process**: GMGN\u2019s suspension is part of the same crackdown, and its appeal is ongoing. No resolution timeline has been disclosed, suggesting a multi-day process[1][5].  \n\n### **Current Appeal Dynamics**  \n- **X\u2019s Appeal Process**: X typically requires users to submit appeals through its support portal. Resolutions can take days to weeks, depending on the complexity of the case[1][17].  \n- **Pump.fun\u2019s Response**: The team has not publicly commented on the suspension, but GMGN\u2019s proactive appeal indicates a structured effort to regain access[1][5].  \n\n### **Critical Uncertainties**  \n1. **Lack of Official Communication**:  \n   - X and Pump.fun have not provided details on the suspension\u2019s cause or resolution path, leaving the community reliant on speculation[1][8][10].  \n2. **Regulatory Overlap**:  \n   - Theories about SEC involvement or broader regulatory scrutiny remain unconfirmed, adding ambiguity to the timeline[2][10][17].  \n3. **API Policy Enforcement**:  \n   - If the suspension stems from API misuse, X may require Pump.fun to demonstrate compliance with its API policies before reinstatement[4][17].  \n\n---\n\n## **Probability Assessment**  \n### **Scenario 1: Account Reinstated by June 20 (p2: Yes)**  \n- **Conditions**:  \n  - X expedites the appeal process due to Pump.fun\u2019s prominence or external pressure.  \n  - The suspension is deemed a technical error or minor policy infraction.  \n- **Supporting Evidence**:  \n  - GMGN\u2019s appeal is ongoing, suggesting X may prioritize resolving high-profile cases[1][5].  \n  - Pump.fun\u2019s token sale and community pressure could incentivize a swift resolution[14][16].  \n\n### **Scenario 2: Account Remains Suspended (p1: No)**  \n- **Conditions**:  \n  - X requires Pump.fun to address systemic API misuse or other violations, delaying reinstatement.  \n  - The suspension is part of a broader regulatory or policy crackdown, extending beyond June 20.  \n- **Supporting Evidence**:  \n  - X\u2019s history of strict API enforcement and prolonged appeals for policy violations[4][17].  \n  - The lack of transparency from X or Pump.fun suggests a complex resolution process[8][10].  \n\n### **Scenario 3: Uncertain Outcome (p3: 50-50)**  \n- **Conditions**:  \n  - Insufficient information to confirm or refute reinstatement by June 20.  \n  - Mixed signals from X\u2019s enforcement patterns and Pump.fun\u2019s appeal progress.  \n\n---\n\n## **Recommendation**  \nGiven the lack of official updates, the complexity of X\u2019s appeal process, and the broader context of API policy enforcement, the most prudent resolution is **p3 (unknown/50-50)**. While Pump.fun\u2019s urgency to resolve the suspension ahead of its token sale may expedite the process, X\u2019s opaque policies and potential regulatory scrutiny introduce significant uncertainty.  \n\n**recommendation: p3**\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.9985, ID: 38095453243172310796199646261630023630970609950377976008350975905388687912651, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.0015, ID: 88981305722589376690032453688570698698989058371572449524922004858577839988644, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.999 = 99.9% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The user wants to know if the @pumpdotfun X account will be unsuspended by Friday, June 20, 2025, based on the provided ancillary data and search results. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The account was suspended on June 16, 2025, and the market resolution depends on whether it's unsuspended between June 16, 4:20 PM ET and June 20, 11:59 PM ET. The resolution sources are the account itself and credible reporting.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's a lot of information about the suspension. The main reasons speculated include unauthorized API usage, misuse of live streaming features, potential SEC scrutiny, and fraudulent activities like autorug. However, X hasn't officially confirmed the reason. \n\nSeveral sources mention that other crypto platforms like GMGN, BullX, and ElizaOS were also suspended, suggesting a broader crackdown. GMGN is actively appealing, but there's no indication that Pump.fun has done the same. The platform's website remains operational, but their social media presence is crucial for their token launch and community engagement.\n\nThe user's ancillary data mentions a $1 billion token sale and a planned airdrop. The suspension timing is critical here. If the account isn't restored, it could impact their ability to communicate with users, potentially affecting the token launch's success.\n\nNow, considering the resolution conditions: Yes (p2) if unsuspended, No (p1) if not, and 0.5 if unknown. The current date is June 17, 2025, and the deadline is June 20. The search results don't mention any official appeals or reinstatements. Pump.fun hasn't regained control yet, and X typically doesn't reverse suspensions quickly, especially without an appeal.\n\nThe user's personalization note says to re-evaluate factors influencing the market's confidence in a 'Yes' outcome. The factors here are the lack of official communication, the severity of the alleged violations (like API misuse), and the platform's dependency on X for marketing. These factors lean towards a lower probability of reinstatement by the deadline.\n\nAdditionally, the search results indicate that X has been strict with API policies, and Pump.fun's suspension might be part of a larger enforcement action. Without evidence of an appeal or resolution, it's unlikely the account will be unsuspended by June 20. Therefore, the recommendation should be p1 (No).\n</think>\n\n**Pump.fun X Account Suspension and Market Resolution Analysis**  \n\nThe suspension of Pump.fun\u2019s X account on June 16, 2025, has sparked significant speculation about its reinstatement ahead of the platform\u2019s planned $1 billion token sale and native $PUMP airdrop. Below is a detailed analysis of the factors influencing the likelihood of the account being unsuspended by June 20, 2025, 11:59 PM ET.  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Context and Timeline**  \n- **Suspension Date**: June 16, 2025 (official account and founder Alon Cohen\u2019s handle).  \n- **Resolution Window**: June 16, 4:20 PM ET \u2013 June 20, 11:59 PM ET.  \n- **Primary Resolution Source**: The @pumpdotfun X account (https://x.com/pumpdotfun).  \n- **Secondary Sources**: Credible reporting (e.g., X\u2019s official statements, Pump.fun\u2019s announcements).  \n\n---\n\n### **Factors Influencing Reinstatement**  \n\n#### **1. X\u2019s Enforcement Policies and API Misuse Allegations**  \nX (formerly Twitter) has a history of strict enforcement against unauthorized API usage. Multiple reports suggest Pump.fun and affiliated platforms (e.g., GMGN, BullX) may have violated X\u2019s terms by using third-party or \u201cblack-market\u201d APIs to track tweets and wallet activity[1][3][12]. X\u2019s in-house API subscription starts at $60,000 annually, and platforms allegedly skirted these costs[2][13].  \n\n**Implications**:  \n- X rarely reverses suspensions for API violations without formal appeals.  \n- The coordinated suspension of 19+ crypto accounts (including GMGN, ElizaOS) indicates a broader crackdown, reducing the likelihood of selective reinstatement[7][17].  \n\n#### **2. Regulatory and Legal Scrutiny**  \nPump.fun faces a class-action lawsuit alleging it facilitated unregistered securities and pump-and-dump schemes, generating $500 million in fees[2][27]. While no official SEC probe has been confirmed, the timing of the suspension (pre-token sale) has fueled speculation about regulatory pressure[4][28].  \n\n**Implications**:  \n- Regulatory concerns could delay or block reinstatement.  \n- X may avoid reinstating accounts under active legal scrutiny to mitigate liability.  \n\n#### **3. Market Impact and Token Launch Risks**  \nPump.fun\u2019s X account was critical for marketing its $PUMP token, which had a pre-market valuation of $6 billion[3][12]. The suspension risks:  \n- **Delayed Airdrop**: Reduced visibility for the token launch.  \n- **Revenue Decline**: Loss of social media-driven user engagement and fees[1][19].  \n- **Competitor Gains**: Rival launchpads (e.g., GMGN, BullX) may capitalize on Pump.fun\u2019s absence[1][40].  \n\n**Implications**:  \n- Pump.fun\u2019s urgency to resolve the suspension conflicts with X\u2019s slow appeal process.  \n- The platform\u2019s website remains operational, but social media is vital for meme coin hype[7][16].  \n\n#### **4. Appeal Process and X\u2019s Response**  \nGMGN, another suspended platform, confirmed it is \u201cactively appealing\u201d the decision[2][13]. However, Pump.fun has not publicly acknowledged an appeal, and X typically requires multiple submissions before human review[52][53].  \n\n**Implications**:  \n- Without an appeal, reinstatement is unlikely.  \n- X\u2019s automated systems often reject initial appeals, requiring persistence[52].  \n\n---\n\n### **Resolution Probability Analysis**  \n\n| **Factor**               | **Likelihood of Reinstatement** | **Rationale**                                                                 |  \n|--------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  \n| **API Violations**       | Low                             | X\u2019s strict enforcement and lack of appeal evidence[1][3][12].               |  \n| **Regulatory Pressure**  | Moderate                       | Unconfirmed SEC involvement but ongoing legal risks[4][28].               |  \n| **Market Urgency**       | High                           | Critical token launch timing, but X\u2019s slow process limits action[3][12]. |  \n| **Appeal Success**       | Low                            | No public appeal from Pump.fun; X\u2019s appeal process is time-consuming[52]. |  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nGiven the evidence, the likelihood of Pump.fun\u2019s X account being unsuspended by June 20, 2025, is **low**. X\u2019s enforcement history, the severity of alleged violations, and the absence of a confirmed appeal suggest the suspension will persist. While Pump.fun\u2019s token launch creates urgency, X\u2019s policies and procedural delays make reinstatement improbable within the resolution window.  \n\n**Recommendation**: **p1** (No)",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750183153 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-17 17:59:13 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please re-evaluate the factors influencing the market's strong confidence in a 'Yes' outcome and adjust the recommendation accordingly.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if the @pumpdotfun X account will be unsuspended by Friday, June 20, 2025, based on the provided ancillary data and search results. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The account was suspended on June 16, 2025, and the market resolution depends on whether it's unsuspended between June 16, 4:20 PM ET and June 20, 11:59 PM ET. The resolution sources are the account itself and credible reporting.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's a lot of information about the suspension. The main reasons speculated include unauthorized API usage, misuse of live streaming features, potential SEC scrutiny, and fraudulent activities like autorug. However, X hasn't officially confirmed the reason. \n\nSeveral sources mention that other crypto platforms like GMGN, BullX, and ElizaOS were also suspended, suggesting a broader crackdown. GMGN is actively appealing, but there's no indication that Pump.fun has done the same. The platform's website remains operational, but their social media presence is crucial for their token launch and community engagement.\n\nThe user's ancillary data mentions a $1 billion token sale and a planned airdrop. The suspension timing is critical here. If the account isn't restored, it could impact their ability to communicate with users, potentially affecting the token launch's success.\n\nNow, considering the resolution conditions: Yes (p2) if unsuspended, No (p1) if not, and 0.5 if unknown. The current date is June 17, 2025, and the deadline is June 20. The search results don't mention any official appeals or reinstatements. Pump.fun hasn't regained control yet, and X typically doesn't reverse suspensions quickly, especially without an appeal.\n\nThe user's personalization note says to re-evaluate factors influencing the market's confidence in a 'Yes' outcome. The factors here are the lack of official communication, the severity of the alleged violations (like API misuse), and the platform's dependency on X for marketing. These factors lean towards a lower probability of reinstatement by the deadline.\n\nAdditionally, the search results indicate that X has been strict with API policies, and Pump.fun's suspension might be part of a larger enforcement action. Without evidence of an appeal or resolution, it's unlikely the account will be unsuspended by June 20. Therefore, the recommendation should be p1 (No).\n</think>\n\n**Pump.fun X Account Suspension and Market Resolution Analysis**  \n\nThe suspension of Pump.fun\u2019s X account on June 16, 2025, has sparked significant speculation about its reinstatement ahead of the platform\u2019s planned $1 billion token sale and native $PUMP airdrop.

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.999 = 99.9% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.

If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
