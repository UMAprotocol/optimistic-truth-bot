      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if there were 271 or more graduated tokens on pump.fun on May 22, 2025. The resolution source is the Dune Analytics dashboard by adam_tehc, specifically the \"Tokens Created Daily\" bar chart. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any data related to May 22, 2025. Looking through the search results, most of them mention general statistics about pump.fun, like the number of tokens created daily, graduation rates, and competition from other platforms. However, none of the search results explicitly mention data for May 22, 2025. \n\nThe key sources here are the Dune Analytics links provided by the user. The main dashboard is at [1] (https://dune.com/adam_tehc/pumpfun). The user also provided other Dune links, like [3], [5], [6], which might have related data. However, the search results don't include the actual data from May 22. \n\nLooking at the graduation rates, sources like [10], [12], [14], [27], [30], [32], [47], [48], [49], [50] mention that the graduation rate is typically around 1.4% to 2%. For example, [10] states a 1.4% graduation rate. If on May 22, the number of tokens created was around 40,000 (as per [4], [8]), applying a 1.4% rate would give about 560 graduated tokens, which is well above 271. However, recent data from [11] and [51] indicates that Pump.fun's dominance is decreasing, with graduation rates dropping. For instance, [11] mentions that Pump.fun's share of graduated tokens fell to 57.5%, but this is about market share, not the absolute number.\n\nAnother point is [41], which mentions a decline in graduated tokens by February 2025, but that's earlier in the year. By May, the situation might have changed. [51] from May 13, 2025, states that Raydium's LaunchLab surpassed Pump.fun in graduations (198 vs. 171), but that's a specific day and doesn't directly indicate May 22's numbers.\n\nSince the user's resolution source is the specific Dune dashboard, and the search results don't provide the exact number for May 22, I can't find direct evidence. However, given historical data, if the daily token creation was around 40k with a 1.4% graduation rate, the number would be around 560, which is over 271. But if the graduation rate dropped significantly due to competition (as per [11]), the number might be lower. \n\nHowever, without explicit data for May 22, and considering the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome if no verifiable info is available, the answer would lean towards \"Yes\" based on historical rates. But since the current data (as of May 2025) shows competition reducing Pump.fun's graduations, maybe the number is lower. But the exact data isn't present in the provided sources. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. Since May 22 is in the past (current date is May 23, 2025), and the source is Dune, but the search results don't include the May 22 data, I have to infer. If the graduation rate was around 1.4%, and daily tokens are 40k, 1.4% is 560. Even if the rate dropped to 1%, 40k tokens would be 400 graduations. Both are above 271. Therefore, the most probable outcome is \"Yes\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1748004262 Current Date and Time: 2025-05-23 12:44:22 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if there were 271 or more graduated tokens on pump.fun on May 22, 2025. The resolution source is the Dune Analytics dashboard by adam_tehc, specifically the \"Tokens Created Daily\" bar chart. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any data related to May 22, 2025. Looking through the search results, most of them mention general statistics about pump.fun, like the number of tokens created daily, graduation rates, and competition from other platforms. However, none of the search results explicitly mention data for May 22, 2025. \n\nThe key sources here are the Dune Analytics links provided by the user. The main dashboard is at [1] (https://dune.com/adam_tehc/pumpfun). The user also provided other Dune links, like [3], [5], [6], which might have related data. However, the search results don't include the actual data from May 22. \n\nLooking at the graduation rates, sources like [10], [12], [14], [27], [30], [32], [47], [48], [49], [50] mention that the graduation rate is typically around 1.4% to 2%. For example, [10] states a 1.4% graduation rate. If on May 22, the number of tokens created was around 40,000 (as per [4], [8]), applying a 1.4% rate would give about 560 graduated tokens, which is well above 271. However, recent data from [11] and [51] indicates that Pump.fun's dominance is decreasing, with graduation rates dropping. For instance, [11] mentions that Pump.fun's share of graduated tokens fell to 57.5%, but this is about market share, not the absolute number.\n\nAnother point is [41], which mentions a decline in graduated tokens by February 2025, but that's earlier in the year. By May, the situation might have changed. [51] from May 13, 2025, states that Raydium's LaunchLab surpassed Pump.fun in graduations (198 vs. 171), but that's a specific day and doesn't directly indicate May 22's numbers.\n\nSince the user's resolution source is the specific Dune dashboard, and the search results don't provide the exact number for May 22, I can't find direct evidence. However, given historical data, if the daily token creation was around 40k with a 1.4% graduation rate, the number would be around 560, which is over 271. But if the graduation rate dropped significantly due to competition (as per [11]), the number might be lower. \n\nHowever, without explicit data for May 22, and considering the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome if no verifiable info is available, the answer would lean towards \"Yes\" based on historical rates. But since the current data (as of May 2025) shows competition reducing Pump.fun's graduations, maybe the number is lower. But the exact data isn't present in the provided sources. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. Since May 22 is in the past (current date is May 23, 2025), and the source is Dune, but the search results don't include the May 22 data, I have to infer. If the graduation rate was around 1.4%, and daily tokens are 40k, 1.4% is 560. Even if the rate dropped to 1%, 40k tokens would be 400 graduations. Both are above 271. Therefore, the most probable outcome is \"Yes\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.0005, ID: 85016960578474521895184099521519185020816712929778671152985249027472903636526, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.9995, ID: 80906343929084020764762126779471940219865227211172024518829894533231627413505, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

However, the solver's recommendation of 'Yes' (p2) is based on assumptions and historical extrapolation rather than concrete data from the specified date, May 22, 2025. The response fails to provide a definitive answer based on the specific data from the Dune Analytics dashboard for the exact date in question, which is a critical requirement. Furthermore, the market sentiment strongly favors 'No' (p1), with a price of 0.9995 indicating nearly 100% confidence, which starkly contradicts the solver's recommendation.",

The solver effectively uses historical data to predict the trend on the event date, which is a reasonable approach given the query's nature.
