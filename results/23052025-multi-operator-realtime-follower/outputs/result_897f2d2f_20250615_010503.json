The search results include multiple sources about the parade, including live coverage, transcripts, and articles. \n\nLooking at the search results, there are several transcripts of Trump's speeches. For example, in [10], there's a transcript from his West Point speech in May 2025 where he mentions \"one-trillion-dollar investment.\" In [25], his inaugural address mentions \"trillions of dollars.\" However, these are from different events. \n\nThe key is to find the specific speech he gave on June 14, 2025. Search results [1], [2], [3], [5], [6], [13], [17], [32], [34], [49], [50], [56] all reference the June 14 parade. However, the actual transcripts of his speech at that event are not directly provided. Some sources like [1] mention his remarks about the parade, but don't include the full transcript. \n\nIn [50], an AP article describes the parade and mentions Trump swearing in troops but doesn't quote him using the terms. [56] from america250.org states he will deliver remarks but doesn't provide the content. Without the exact transcript, I have to infer based on his speaking patterns from other recent speeches. \n\nTrump often uses terms like \"million\" or \"billion\" in speeches about budgets, military spending, or economic achievements. For instance, in [10] and [43], he mentions \"one-trillion-dollar investment\" and \"billions\" in military context. Given the parade's focus on military strength and his history of using such terms, it's plausible he used them multiple times. However, confirming 10+ instances requires the actual speech content.\n\nSince the resolution source is the event video, and the provided search results don't include the full transcript, I can't definitively count the terms. However, based on his past behavior and the event's context, it's likely he used these terms, but reaching 10+ is uncertain. However, the user's personalization instructions state that if the event occurred and no verifiable info contradicts, assume the most probable outcome. Given Trump's tendency to use such terms in military contexts, and the event's focus on military spending and achievements, it's probable he met the threshold. \n\nBut wait, the user's personalization also says if the event is in the past and no info is provided, assume the most probable outcome. The current date in the context is June 15, 2025, so the event happened. The search results [50] mention the parade occurred, but no transcript. However, [27] from Sky News mentions Trump's speech, including quotes like \"We want to show off a little bit,\" but no specific terms. [50] also notes he swore in troops but doesn't mention the terms. \n\nWithout explicit evidence of the terms being used 10+ times, but considering Trump's speaking style, the answer leans towards \"Yes,\" but the lack of direct evidence complicates it. However, the instructions say to resolve based on available info. Since the search results don't confirm the count, but the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome if the event occurred. Given Trump's pattern, it's likely he used the terms enough. But without the exact count, maybe the safe answer is \"Yes\" (p2) if the terms are mentioned at all, but the query is about 10+ times. Wait, the market resolves to \"Yes\" if he says any of the terms 10+ times. \n\nLooking again, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info on the outcome, assume the most probable outcome. Since the event happened on June 14, and the current timestamp is June 15, but the search results don't provide the speech transcript, I have to infer. If the user's system can't access the video, but the ancillary data says the resolution is based on the video, and the assistant must use provided search results. Since the search results don't include the speech transcript, the assistant can't confirm the count. However, the user's personalization says if no verifiable info, assume the most probable. Given Trump's history, it's probable he used the terms multiple times, but 10+ is a high number. \n\nWait, in [10], he mentions \"one-trillion-dollar investment\" once. In [25], \"trillions\" once. In [43], \"one-trillion-dollar investment\" again. If in the June 14 speech he discussed military budgets, he might use \"billion\" or \"trillion\" several times. But reaching 10 instances? Maybe not. However, without the actual speech, it's uncertain. The safe answer under the guidelines would be p4 (cannot resolve), but the user's personalization says if the event occurred and no info, assume the most probable. Since the event occurred and no sources contradict, but no sources confirm the count, the resolution would be p4. However, the user's instructions say if the event occurred and no info, assume the most probable. The most probable might be \"No\" because 10+ is a high threshold unless there's evidence. But I'm conflicted. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is \"No\" because the provided search results don't show him using the terms in that speech. Since the assistant must base the answer on the provided context, and the context doesn't include the speech transcript, it can't confirm 10+ uses. Therefore, the answer would be \"No\" (p1). But the user's personalization says if the event occurred and no info, assume the most probable. The assistant should check if any sources mention the terms. \n\nLooking again, in [56], the announcement of the event says Trump will deliver remarks celebrating the Army's achievements, including \"historic pay raises\" and \"invested in cutting-edge technologies.\" These might involve financial terms, but no specific mention of million/billion/trillion. Without the actual speech, the assistant can't confirm. Therefore, under the rules, if the event occurred but no info on the outcome, and the query can't be verified, it should resolve to the default, which is p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable. If the assistant can't find evidence, it should default to \"No\" because the burden of proof isn't met. Hence, recommendation: p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749949399 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-15 01:03:19 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump will say \"Million,\" \"Billion,\" or \"Trillion\" 10 or more times during his main speech at the Army's 250th Anniversary event on June 14, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he does, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any transcripts or mentions of Trump's speeches related to this event.

Search results [1], [2], [3], [5], [6], [13], [17], [32], [34], [49], [50], [56] all reference the June 14 parade. However, the actual transcripts of his speech at that event are not directly provided. Some sources like [1] mention his remarks about the parade, but don't include the full transcript. \n\nIn [50], an AP article describes the parade and mentions Trump swearing in troops but doesn't quote him using the terms. [56] from america250.org states he will deliver remarks but doesn't provide the content.

Given Trump's tendency to use such terms in military contexts, and the event's focus on military spending and achievements, it's probable he met the threshold. \n\nBut wait, the user's personalization also says if the event is in the past and no info is provided, assume the most probable outcome. The current date in the context is June 15, 2025, so the event happened. The search results [50] mention the parade occurred, but no transcript. However, [27] from Sky News mentions Trump's speech, including quotes like \"We want to show off a little bit,\" but no specific terms. [50] also notes he swore in troops but doesn't mention the terms. \n\nWithout explicit evidence of the terms being used 10+ times, but considering Trump's speaking style, the answer leans towards \"Yes,\" but the lack of direct evidence complicates it. However, the instructions say to resolve based on available info. Since the search results don't confirm the count, but the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome if the event occurred.

Given Trump's history, it's probable he used the terms multiple times, but 10+ is a high number. \n\nWait, in [10], he mentions \"one-trillion-dollar investment\" once. In [25], \"trillions\" once. In [43], \"one-trillion-dollar investment\" again. If in the June 14 speech he discussed military budgets, he might use \"billion\" or \"trillion\" several times. But reaching 10 instances? Maybe not. However, without the actual speech, it's uncertain. The safe answer under the guidelines would be p4 (cannot resolve), but the user's personalization says if the event occurred and no info, assume the most probable. Since the event occurred and no sources contradict, but no sources confirm the count, the resolution would be p4. However, the user's instructions say if the event occurred and no info, assume the most probable. The most probable might be \"No\" because 10+ is a high threshold unless there's evidence. But I'm conflicted. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is \"No\" because the provided search results don't show him using the terms in that speech. Since the assistant must base the answer on the provided context, and the context doesn't include the speech transcript, it can't confirm 10+ uses. Therefore, the answer would be \"No\" (p1). But the user's personalization says if the event occurred and no info, assume the most probable. The assistant should check if any sources mention the terms. \n\nLooking again, in [56], the announcement of the event says Trump will deliver remarks celebrating the Army's achievements, including \"historic pay raises\" and \"invested in cutting-edge technologies.\" These might involve financial terms, but no specific mention of million/billion/trillion. Without the actual speech, the assistant can't confirm. Therefore, under the rules, if the event occurred but no info on the outcome, and the query can't be verified, it should resolve to the default, which is p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable. If the assistant can't find evidence, it should default to \"No\" because the burden of proof isn't met.

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.
