Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Ethereum Up or Down - June 13, 7 PM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for ETH/USDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the ETH/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ETH_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance ETH/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 551333\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749860163 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-14 00:16:03 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Configure logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nconsole_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\nconsole_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nconsole_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\nlogger.addHandler(console_handler)\n\ndef get_eth_price_change(date_str, hour, minute, timezone_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches the percentage change for the ETH/USDT pair on Binance for the specified hour candle.\n\n    Args:\n        date_str: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format\n        hour: Hour in 24-hour format\n        minute: Minute\n        timezone_str: Timezone string\n\n    Returns:\n        Percentage change as float or None if data cannot be fetched.\n    \"\"\"\n    logger.info(f\"Fetching ETH/USDT price change for {date_str} at {hour}:{minute} {timezone_str}\")\n    \n    # Convert the target time to UTC timestamp\n    try:\n        tz = pytz.timezone(timezone_str)\n        time_str = f\"{hour:02d}:{minute:02d}:00\"\n        target_time_local = tz.localize(\n            datetime.strptime(f\"{date_str} {time_str}\", \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n        )\n        target_time_utc = target_time_local.astimezone(timezone.utc)\n        start_time_ms = int(target_time_utc.timestamp() * 1000)\n        \n        logger.debug(f\"Converted local time to UTC timestamp: {start_time_ms}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Error converting time: {e}\")\n        return None\n\n    # Binance API endpoint\n    api_url = \"https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines\"\n    params = {\n        \"symbol\": \"ETHUSDT\",\n        \"interval\": \"1h\",\n        \"limit\": 1,\n        \"startTime\": start_time_ms,\n        \"endTime\": start_time_ms + 3600000  # plus 1 hour\n    }\n\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(api_url, params=params, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n        \n        if data and len(data) > 0:\n            open_price = float(data[0][1])\n            close_price = float(data[0][4])\n            price_change_percent = ((close_price - open_price) / open_price) * 100\n            logger.info(f\"Successfully retrieved price change: {price_change_percent}%\")\n            return price_change_percent\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        logger.error(f\"API request failed: {e}\")\n    \n    return None\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to determine if the ETH/USDT price went up or down on June 13, 2025, at 7 PM ET.\n    \"\"\"\n    date_str = \"2025-06-13\"\n    hour = 19  # 7 PM\n    minute = 0\n    timezone_str = \"US/Eastern\"\n\n    price_change_percent = get_eth_price_change(date_str, hour, minute, timezone_str)\n    \n    if price_change_percent is None:\n        print(\"recommendation: p3\")  # Unknown/50-50 if data cannot be fetched\n    elif price_change_percent >= 0:\n        print(\"recommendation: p2\")  # Up\n    else:\n        print(\"recommendation: p1\")  # Down\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p3\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful. Recommendation found: p3.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p3\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.86, ID: 40081504678304888064278173095408894070560707889183459105820454621283426054987, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.14, ID: 104510297232493713194898907410933593654966672286918986694575923372184525132749, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.860 = 86.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

I need you to generate code to solve the following prediction market question:\n\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Ethereum Up or Down - June 13, 7 PM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for ETH/USDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the ETH/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ETH_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance ETH/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 551333\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease write Python code that will gather the necessary data to answer this question definitively.\n\nIMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:\n1. DO NOT use command-line arguments. Extract all necessary information from the question itself.\n2. Load environment variables from .env files using the python-dotenv package.\n3. For API keys, use the following environment variables:\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\n\n4. Available Data Sources Information:\n\n5. Query Type Specific Information:\n\n\n6. NEVER include actual API key values in the code, always load them from environment variables.\n\n7. IMPORTANT FOR ALL DATA SOURCES: If a proxy endpoint is provided alongside a primary endpoint, you MUST implement the fallback mechanism described above.

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Ethereum Up or Down - June 13, 7 PM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for ETH/USDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the ETH/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ETH_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance ETH/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 551333\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749860163 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-14 00:16:03 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p3. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Configure logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nconsole_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\nconsole_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nconsole_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\nlogger.addHandler(console_handler)\n\ndef get_eth_price_change(date_str, hour=19, minute=0, timezone_str=\"US/Eastern\"):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches the percentage change for the ETH/USDT pair on Binance for the specified hour candle.\n\n    Args:\n        date_str: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format\n        hour: Hour in 24-hour format (default: 19)\n        minute: Minute (default: 0)\n        timezone_str: Timezone string (default: \"US/Eastern\")\n\n    Returns:\n        Percentage change as float or None if data cannot be retrieved.\n    \"\"\"\n    logger.info(f\"Fetching ETH/USDT price change for {date_str} at {hour}:{minute} {timezone_str}\")\n    \n    # Convert the target time to UTC timestamp\n    try:\n        tz = pytz.timezone(timezone_str)\n        time_str = f\"{hour:02d}:{minute:02d}:00\"\n        target_time_local = tz.localize(\n            datetime.strptime(f\"{date_str} {time_str}\", \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n        )\n        target_time_utc = target_time_local.astimezone(timezone.utc)\n        start_time_ms = int(target_time_utc.timestamp() * 1000)\n        \n        logger.debug(f\"Converted local time to UTC timestamp: {start_time_ms}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Error converting time: {e}\")\n        return None\n\n    # Binance API endpoint\n    api_url = \"https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines\"\n    params = {\n        \"symbol\": \"ETHUSDT\",\n        \"interval\": \"1h\",\n        \"limit\": 1,\n        \"startTime\": start_time_ms,\n        \"endTime\": start_time_ms + 3600000  # plus 1 hour\n    }\n\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(api_url, params=params)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n        \n        if data:\n            open_price = float(data[0][1])\n            close_price = float(data[0][4])\n            price_change_percent = ((close_price - open_price) / open_price) * 100\n            logger.info(f\"Successfully retrieved price change: {price_change_percent}%\")\n            return price_change_percent\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        logger.error(f\"API request failed: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to determine if the ETH/USDT price went up or down on June 13, 2025, at 7 PM ET.\n    \"\"\"\n    date_str = \"2025-06-13\"\n    hour = 19  # 7 PM ET\n    minute = 0\n    timezone_str = \"US/Eastern\"\n\n    price_change_percent = get_eth_price_change(date_str, hour, minute, timezone_str)\n\n    if price_change_percent is None:\n        print(\"recommendation: p3\")  # Unknown/50-50 if data cannot be retrieved\n    elif price_change_percent >= 0:\n        print(\"recommendation: p2\")  # Up\n    else:\n        print(\"recommendation: p1\")  # Down\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p3\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.860 = 86.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve whether the ETH/USDT price on Binance was up or down for the 1-hour candle starting June 13, 7 PM ET. The current timestamp is June 14, 00:16:03 UTC, which is June 13, 8:16 PM ET. So the candle in question (7-8 PM ET) has already closed. \n\nFirst, I need to check the Binance ETH/USDT pair for that specific 1-hour candle. The resolution depends on the percentage change shown on Binance for that period. The user provided several search results, including real-time price data and historical API endpoints. \n\nLooking at the search results, [4] and [12] mention specific price points and technical analysis around June 12-13, 2025. However, the exact 1-hour window from 7-8 PM ET on June 13 isn't directly mentioned. The current price in [1] and [5] is around $2,547, but that's the latest 24-hour data, not the specific hour. \n\nSince the event time has passed, and assuming Binance's data is accurate, the 1H candle's percentage change should be available. If the change is >=0%, it's \"Up\" (p2), else \"Down\" (p1). Without explicit data in the provided sources, but given the market closed, the answer hinges on Binance's finalized data. Since the user's personalization instructs to resolve based on the most probable outcome if no data is found, but the event is past, I should check if any sources indicate the price movement during that hour. \n\nSearch result [27] mentions a price drop to $2,502.58 with a 0.67% increase, but the timestamp is unclear. [44] is the Binance trade page, which would have the accurate data. Since the user's instructions prioritize the specified URL, and assuming the 1H candle closed with a negative change (as the 24h change is -3.50% in [1]), but that's over 24h, not the specific hour. \n\nWithout explicit data for the exact hour, but the event time has passed, the resolution should default to the actual Binance data. However, the provided search results don't include the exact 1H candle's percentage. Given the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome if no data is available, but the event is in the past, I might need to infer. However, since the current time is after the event, and the user expects a definitive answer, the correct approach is to check Binance's historical data. \n\nSince the search results don't provide the exact 1H change, but the user's personalization says to use the specified URL, which is Binance's ETH/USDT page, and given the ancillary data, the resolution should be based on that. If I can't access live data, but the current timestamp is after the event, the answer should be based on the actual outcome. However, without the exact data point here, I might have to conclude p4 (cannot resolve), but the user says if the event is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" \n\nBut the user provided the Binance URL as the source. Since the event time has passed, and the data should be available, but in the provided search results, there's no direct mention of the 7-8 PM ET 1H candle. However, [27] mentions a price of $2,502.58 at some point, but timing is unclear. \n\nGiven the instructions, I should check the Binance API or the provided URL. Since I can't access live data, but the user's search results include [44], which is the Binance trade page. If the 1H candle's change is positive, it's p2; else p1. Without explicit data, but given the 24h trend is down, but that's not specific. \n\nAlternatively, the current price at 00:16 UTC is $2,547, which is after 8:16 PM ET. The 7-8 PM ET candle would be from 23:00 to 00:00 UTC. Looking at the search results, [27] mentions a price of $2,502.58 with a +0.67% increase, but the timestamp is June 12, 2025. [4] has a post from 2025-05-18 showing a bullish phase, but that's a month prior. \n\nSince the exact data isn't present, but the user's instructions say to use the specified URL and assume the most probable outcome if data is missing, but the event is past, I might have to default to p3 (unknown). However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no data, assume the most probable outcome. But without data, it's unclear. \n\nWait, the user's personalization also states: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" \n\nBut how to determine the most probable? The ancillary data says p1 is Down, p2 is Up. If I can't find the exact change, perhaps the market should resolve to p3 (unknown). However, the user's instructions say p3 is 0.5, but the resolution conditions are p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: 50-50. \n\nBut the event has occurred, so it should be resolvable. Since the user provided the Binance URL, and the current time is after the event, the correct approach is to check Binance's historical data for that 1H candle. However, the provided search results don't include that specific data. \n\nGiven the conflict, but the user's personalization says to heavily bias towards the provided URLs. The specified URL is https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ETH_USDT, which in the search results [44] is the Binance trade page. If I can't access the live page, but the user's search results include [27] which mentions a price drop around June 13, but not the exact hour. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1H candle closed with a negative change, given the overall 24h trend is down. But that's speculative. Since the instructions require using the specified URL and the resolution source is Binance's displayed change for the 1H candle, and without that exact data in the provided context, I might have to conclude p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThis is a bit of a dilemma. Without the exact data point, but the event time has passed, the correct resolution would depend on the actual Binance data. Since the assistant can't access live data, but the user provided search results, perhaps there's a clue. \n\nLooking again, search result [27] from 2025-06-13 mentions a price of $2,502.58 with a +0.67% increase, but the time is unclear. If that's during the 7-8 PM ET hour, then the change is positive, resolving to p2. However, the timestamp in [27] is 2025-06-13 00:16:03 UTC, which is June 13, 8:16 PM ET, so after the 7-8 PM candle. The 1H candle from 7-8 PM ET would be 23:00-00:00 UTC. \n\nIf the price at 00:00 UTC was higher than at 23:00 UTC, then the change is positive. The current price at 00:16 UTC is $2,547, but that's after the candle closed. Without the exact open and close prices for that hour, it's impossible to determine. \n\nGiven the instructions, and the lack of specific data in the provided search results, but the event is in the past, the resolution should be p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no data, assume the most probable outcome. But without data, it's impossible to know. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nThe current timestamp is 2025-06-14 00:16:03 UTC, which is after the event time (June 13, 7 PM ET, which is 23:00 UTC). The event has occurred, so we need to resolve it. The user's instructions say to use the Binance ETH/USDT pair's 1H candle change. \n\nSince the provided search results don't have the exact 1H change, but the user's personalization says to use the specified URL, which is Binance, and if no data is available, assume the most probable outcome. However, without the data, it's unclear. \n\nIn this case, the assistant should recommend p4 (cannot resolve) because the necessary data isn't present in the provided sources, and the assistant can't access live data. However, the user's personalization might require assuming the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, if the assistant infers from the 24h trend being down (-3.50% in [1]), but that's over 24h, not the specific 1H window. The 1H could be up even if the 24h is down. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and lack of specific data, the correct recommendation is p4. However, the user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no data, assume the most probable outcome. But without data, it's impossible to determine. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nSince the event has occurred, but no verifiable info is provided in the search results, we assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data defines p1 as Down, p2 as Up. Without data, it's 50-50, which is p3. But the user's resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5, but the market should resolve to p1 or p2. \n\nThis is confusing. The user's ancillary_data says p3 is 0.5 (unknown/50-50), but the market should resolve to p1 or p2 if possible. Since the event is in the past, and no data is available, the resolution should be p3. However, the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nIn the absence of data, the most probable outcome can't be determined, so p3. But the user's resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5, which is a 50-50. However, the market requires a binary outcome. \n\nThis is a conflict. The correct approach is to check if the event date is in the past and no data is available, then assume the most probable outcome. But without any data, it's impossible. Therefore, the resolution should be p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nGiven the confusion, but the event time has passed, and the user provided the Binance URL as the source, but the search results don't include the specific 1H candle data, the assistant should recommend p4. However, the user's instructions might require a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant should look for the closest data point. For example, in [27], the price at 00:16 UTC is $2,502.58, which is after the candle closed. If the candle's close was higher than its open, it's up. But without the open price, we can't tell. \n\nGiven the instructions, the correct answer is p4, but I'm not entirely sure. However, the user's personalization might expect the assistant to resolve based on available data. Since the event is past, and no data is found, but the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome, which is 50-50, so p3. But the market resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5, which is a tie. \n\nBut the market requires a binary outcome. The user's ancillary_data says p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: 0.5. However, the resolution should be either p1 or p2. Since the data isn't available, but the event is past, the correct resolution is p4. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt... If no verifiable information about the event's outcome... resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nThe ancillary data defines p2 as Up (change >=0). If we assume the most probable outcome is 50-50, but the market requires a binary resolution, perhaps the assistant should default to p3. However, the user's resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5, which is a 50-50, but the market might require p1 or p2. \n\nThis is a bit conflicting. Given the instructions, and the lack of data, the assistant should recommend p4. However, the user's personalization might require assuming the most probable outcome, which without data is 50-50, hence p3. But the market's resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5, which is a split. \n\nI think the correct answer here is p4 because the necessary data to determine the 1H candle's change isn't present in the provided search results, and the assistant can't access live data. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749860163 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-14 00:16:03 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve whether the ETH/USDT price on Binance was up or down for the 1-hour candle starting June 13, 7 PM ET. The current timestamp is June 14, 00:16:03 UTC, which is June 13, 8:16 PM ET. So the candle in question (7-8 PM ET) has already closed. \n\nFirst, I need to check the Binance ETH/USDT pair for that specific 1-hour candle. The resolution depends on the percentage change shown on Binance for that period. The user provided several search results, including real-time price data and historical API endpoints. \n\nLooking at the search results, [4] and [12] mention specific price points and technical analysis around June 12-13, 2025. However, the exact 1-hour window from 7-8 PM ET on June 13 isn't directly mentioned. The current price in [1] and [5] is around $2,547, but that's the latest 24-hour data, not the specific hour. \n\nSince the event time has passed, and assuming Binance's data is accurate, the 1H candle's percentage change should be available. If the change is >=0%, it's \"Up\" (p2), else \"Down\" (p1). Without explicit data in the provided sources, but given the market closed, the answer hinges on Binance's finalized data. Since the user's personalization instructs to resolve based on the most probable outcome if no data is found, but the event is past, I should check if any sources indicate the price movement during that hour. \n\nSearch result [27] mentions a price drop to $2,502.58 with a 0.67% increase, but the timestamp is unclear. [44] is the Binance trade page, which would have the accurate data. Since the user's instructions prioritize the specified URL, and assuming the 1H candle closed with a negative change (as the 24h change is -3.50% in [1]), but that's over 24h, not the specific hour. \n\nWithout explicit data for the exact hour, but the event time has passed, the resolution should default to the actual Binance data. However, the provided search results don't include the exact 1H candle's percentage. Given the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome if no data is available, but the event is in the past, I might need to infer. However, since the current time is after the event, and the user expects a definitive answer, the correct approach is to check Binance's historical data. \n\nSince the search results don't provide the exact 1H change, but the user's personalization says to use the specified URL, which is Binance's ETH/USDT page, and given the ancillary data, the resolution should be based on that. If I can't access live data, but the current timestamp is after the event, the answer should be based on the actual outcome. However, without the exact data point here, I might have to conclude p4 (cannot resolve), but the user says if the event is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" \n\nBut the user provided the Binance URL as the source. Since the event time has passed, and the data should be available, but in the provided search results, there's no direct mention of the 7-8 PM ET 1H candle. However, [27] mentions a price of $2,502.58 at some point, but timing is unclear. \n\nGiven the instructions, I should check the Binance API or the provided URL. Since I can't access live data, but the user's search results include [44], which is the Binance trade page. If the 1H candle's change is positive, it's p2; else p1. Without explicit data, but given the 24h trend is down, but that's not specific. \n\nAlternatively, the current price at 00:16 UTC is $2,547, which is after 8:16 PM ET. The 7-8 PM ET candle would be from 23:00 to 00:00 UTC. Looking at the search results, [27] mentions a price of $2,502.58 with a +0.67% increase, but the timestamp is June 12, 2025. [4] has a post from 2025-05-18 showing a bullish phase, but that's a month prior. \n\nSince the exact data isn't present, but the user's instructions say to use the specified URL and assume the most probable outcome if data is missing, but the event is past, I might have to default to p3 (unknown). However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no data, assume the most probable outcome. But without data, it's unclear. \n\nWait, the user's personalization also states: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" \n\nBut how to determine the most probable? The ancillary data says p1 is Down, p2 is Up. If I can't find the exact change, perhaps the market should resolve to p3 (unknown). However, the user's instructions say p3 is 0.5, but the resolution conditions are p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: 50-50. \n\nBut the event has occurred, so it should be resolvable. Since the user provided the Binance URL, and the current time is after the event, the correct approach is to check Binance's historical data for that 1H candle. However, the provided search results don't include that specific data. \n\nGiven the conflict, but the user's personalization says to heavily bias towards the provided URLs. The specified URL is https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ETH_USDT, which in the search results [44] is the Binance trade page. If I can't access the live page, but the user's search results include [27] which mentions a price drop around June 13, but not the exact hour. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1H candle closed with a negative change, given the overall 24h trend is down. But that's speculative. Since the instructions require using the specified URL and the resolution source is Binance's displayed change for the 1H candle, and without that exact data in the provided context, I might have to conclude p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThis is a bit of a dilemma. Without the exact data point, but the event time has passed, the correct resolution would depend on the actual Binance data. Since the assistant can't access live data, but the user provided search results, perhaps there's a clue. \n\nLooking again, search result [27] from 2025-06-13 mentions a price of $2,502.58 with a +0.67% increase, but the time is unclear. If that's during the 7-8 PM ET hour, then the change is positive, resolving to p2. However, the timestamp in [27] is 2025-06-13 00:16:03 UTC, which is June 13, 8:16 PM ET, so after the 7-8 PM candle. The 1H candle from 7-8 PM ET would be 23:00-00:00 UTC. \n\nIf the price at 00:00 UTC was higher than at 23:00 UTC, then the change is positive. The current price at 00:16 UTC is $2,547, but that's after the candle closed. Without the exact open and close prices for that hour, it's impossible to determine. \n\nGiven the instructions, and the lack of specific data in the provided search results, but the event is in the past, the resolution should be p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no data, assume the most probable outcome. But without data, it's impossible to know. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nThe current timestamp is 2025-06-14 00:16:03 UTC, which is after the event time (June 13, 7 PM ET, which is 23:00 UTC). The event has occurred, so we need to resolve it. The user's instructions say to use the Binance ETH/USDT pair's 1H candle change. \n\nSince the provided search results don't have the exact 1H change, but the user's personalization says to use the specified URL, which is Binance, and if no data is available, assume the most probable outcome. However, without the data, it's unclear. \n\nIn this case, the assistant should recommend p4 (cannot resolve) because the necessary data isn't present in the provided sources, and the assistant can't access live data. However, the user's personalization might require assuming the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, if the assistant infers from the 24h trend being down (-3.50% in [1]), but that's over 24h, not the specific 1H window. The 1H could be up even if the 24h is down. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and lack of specific data, the correct recommendation is p4. However, the user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no data, assume the most probable outcome. But without data, it's impossible to determine. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nSince the event has occurred, but no verifiable info is provided in the search results, we assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data defines p1 as Down, p2 as Up. Without data, it's 50-50, which is p3. But the user's resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5, but the market should resolve to p1 or p2. \n\nThis is confusing. The user's ancillary_data says p3 is 0.5 (unknown/50-50), but the market should resolve to p1 or p2 if possible. Since the event is in the past, and no data is available, the resolution should be p3. However, the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nIn the absence of data, the most probable outcome can't be determined, so p3. But the user's resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5, which is a 50-50. However, the market requires a binary outcome. \n\nThis is a conflict. The correct approach is to check if the event date is in the past and no data is available, then assume the most probable outcome. But without any data, it's impossible. Therefore, the resolution should be p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nGiven the confusion, but the event time has passed, and the user provided the Binance URL as the source, but the search results don't include the specific 1H candle data, the assistant should recommend p4. However, the user's instructions might require a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant should look for the closest data point. For example, in [27], the price at 00:16 UTC is $2,502.58, which is after the candle closed. If the candle's close was higher than its open, it's up. But without the open price, we can't tell. \n\nGiven the instructions, the correct answer is p4, but I'm not entirely sure. However, the user's personalization might expect the assistant to resolve based on available data. Since the event is past, and no data is found, but the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome, which is 50-50, so p3. But the market resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5, which is a tie. \n\nBut the market requires a binary outcome. The user's ancillary_data says p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: 0.5. However, the resolution should be either p1 or p2. Since the data isn't available, but the event is past, the correct resolution is p4. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt... If no verifiable information about the event's outcome... resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nThe ancillary data defines p2 as Up (change >=0). If we assume the most probable outcome is 50-50, but the market requires a binary resolution, perhaps the assistant should default to p3. However, the user's resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5, which is a 50-50, but the market might require p1 or p2. \n\nThis is a bit conflicting. Given the instructions, and the lack of data, the assistant should recommend p4. However, the user's personalization might require assuming the most probable outcome, which without data is 50-50, hence p3. But the market's resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5, which is a split. \n\nI think the correct answer here is p4 because the necessary data to determine the 1H candle's change isn't present in the provided search results, and the assistant can't access live data. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.86, ID: 40081504678304888064278173095408894070560707889183459105820454621283426054987, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.14, ID: 104510297232493713194898907410933593654966672286918986694575923372184525132749, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve whether the ETH/USDT pair on Binance had a price change percentage greater than or equal to 0 for the 1-hour candle starting on June 13, 7 PM ET. The resolution depends on the data from Binance's ETH/USDT pair, specifically the change value shown for that 1H candle once it's finalized.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the exact time window for the 1-hour candle. The title mentions June 13, 7 PM ET. Since Binance uses UTC, I need to convert 7 PM ET to UTC. Eastern Time is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, so 7 PM ET would be 23:00 UTC (7 PM + 4 hours). The 1-hour candle would run from 23:00 UTC to 00:00 UTC on June 14. However, the current timestamp provided is 2025-06-14 00:16:03 UTC, which is just after the candle's closing time. But the candle's data might take a few minutes to finalize, so I need to check if the data for that specific candle is available.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are several sources mentioning Binance API endpoints for fetching kline/candlestick data. For example, result [1] from Binance.US API documentation mentions the kline endpoint, which can retrieve candlestick data. The user needs the 1H candle's change percentage, which is part of the kline data. The change percentage is calculated as (Close - Open)/Open * 100.\n\nI should check if there's any data available for the 23:00 UTC candle. The current time is 00:16 UTC, so the candle closed 16 minutes ago. Binance typically finalizes candles shortly after their close, so the data should be available. \n\nLooking at the search results, result [3] discusses an issue where the ticker symbol was lost in API responses, but the user is specifically using ETH/USDT, which is a standard pair. Result [21] provides a Python example to fetch the latest price using Binance API, which could be adapted to fetch historical klines. Result [38] mentions a Kaggle dataset with Binance ETH/USDT 1-minute data up to December 2021, but that's outdated. Result [44] from Tardis.dev mentions Binance historical data availability, including trades and OHLCV, but the exact timeframe needed here is recent.\n\nSince the current date in the scenario is June 14, 2025, and the candle in question is from June 13 23:00 UTC to June 14 00:00 UTC, the data should be accessible via Binance's API. The user's ancillary data specifies using Binance's displayed change value for the 1H candle. \n\nHowever, none of the provided search results directly show the specific 1H candle's change percentage for that time. The search results include real-time price data (e.g., result [24] shows ETH/USDT trading at around $2,559.51), but that's the current price, not the change for the specific candle. Result [25] has social media posts from June 11, 2025, discussing ETH prices, but nothing for June 13. Result [27] from CoinGecko shows the current price and market data but not historical candles. Result [30] is the Binance.US spot trade page for ETH/USDT, which would display the 1H change, but the provided content doesn't include the specific candle's data.\n\nGiven that the search results don't contain the exact change percentage for the 23:00 UTC 1H candle, and the current timestamp is just after the candle closed, it's possible that the data isn't yet available in the provided sources. However, according to the user's instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable information is available, we should assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. Since the market resolves to Up if the change is >=0, and without data indicating a negative change, the default would be to resolve to Up (p2). But the user's previous response was p4, and they want a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, considering the ETH price movement around that time: result [25] mentions a post on June 11, 2025, with ETH at $2,528, and result [27] shows the current price as $2,572.14 on Binance. If the price increased from the open to close of the 1H candle, the change would be positive. However, without the exact open and close prices for that specific hour, this is speculative.\n\nSince the exact data isn't present in the search results and the user's previous attempt returned p4, perhaps due to data unavailability, but the current time is past the event, the resolution should be based on the most probable outcome. If the price at 00:00 UTC is higher than at 23:00 UTC, the change is positive. However, without concrete data, it's uncertain. But per the user's ancillary data, if no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. Given the market's nature, it's 50-50, but the instructions say to default to p4 if unresolved. However, the user's note says if the event date is in the past and no data, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. Since the query is about whether the change is >=0, and without data showing a negative change, perhaps the default is to resolve to Up (p2). But this is a stretch. Alternatively, if the candle's close is the same as open, it's 0, which is >=0, so Up. But without data, it's unclear. Given the ambiguity, the correct recommendation might still be p4, but the user wants a different approach. Maybe check if the current price after the candle's close is higher than the open, but without the open price, this isn't possible. \n\nWait, the user's query says the change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once finalized. If that data isn't accessible in the provided search results, and the current time is after the candle's close, but no sources confirm the change, then it's unresolved. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. If the market is about whether the change is >=0, and without evidence of a negative change, perhaps the default is to resolve to Up. But this is an assumption. Alternatively, if the price at the end of the hour is the same as the start, it's 0, which is Up. But without data, it's uncertain. \n\nGiven the instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. Since the user's previous response was p4, maybe the correct answer is p2, assuming the price didn't drop. But without concrete data, this is speculative. However, the user's personalization says to heavily bias towards the provided URLs. The resolution source is Binance's ETH/USDT page (result [24]), but the content there doesn't show historical candles. The provided search results don't include the specific 1H candle's change. Therefore, despite the event being in the past, without accessible data, the recommendation remains p4. But the user says to try again. Maybe check if any sources in the search results have the required data. \n\nLooking again, result [27] from CoinGecko shows the 24h price change as -3.02%, but that's for 24h, not the specific 1H candle. Result [30] from Binance.US shows the current price but not historical. Result [43] is a Binance Square post from May 11, 2025, discussing ETH at $2,472, which is older. Result [25] from June 11 mentions a price of $2,528. Result [24] from Binance's ETH/USDT page shows the current price as $2,559.51, but no historical data. \n\nSince none of the provided sources have the specific 1H candle's change percentage for June 13 23:00 UTC, and the current time is past the event, but data isn't available in the search results, the resolution can't be confirmed. Therefore, the recommendation should be p4. However, the user's note says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. If we assume that the price didn't drop during that hour, it would resolve to Up. But this is an assumption. Given the ambiguity, the correct answer is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749860163 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-14 00:16:03 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve whether the ETH/USDT pair on Binance had a price change percentage greater than or equal to 0 for the 1-hour candle starting on June 13, 7 PM ET. The resolution depends on the data from Binance's ETH/USDT pair, specifically the change value shown for that 1H candle once it's finalized.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the exact time window for the 1-hour candle. The title mentions June 13, 7 PM ET. Since Binance uses UTC, I need to convert 7 PM ET to UTC. Eastern Time is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, so 7 PM ET would be 23:00 UTC (7 PM + 4 hours). The 1-hour candle would run from 23:00 UTC to 00:00 UTC on June 14. However, the current timestamp provided is 2025-06-14 00:16:03 UTC, which is just after the candle's closing time. But the candle's data might take a few minutes to finalize, so I need to check if the data for that specific candle is available.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are several sources mentioning Binance API endpoints for fetching kline/candlestick data. For example, result [1] from Binance.US API documentation mentions the kline endpoint, which can retrieve candlestick data. The user needs the 1H candle's change percentage, which is part of the kline data. The change percentage is calculated as (Close - Open)/Open * 100.\n\nI should check if there's any data available for the 23:00 UTC candle. The current time is 00:16 UTC, so the candle closed 16 minutes ago. Binance typically finalizes candles shortly after their close, so the data should be available. \n\nLooking at the search results, result [3] discusses an issue where the ticker symbol was lost in API responses, but the user is specifically using ETH/USDT, which is a standard pair. Result [21] provides a Python example to fetch the latest price using Binance API, which could be adapted to fetch historical klines. Result [38] mentions a Kaggle dataset with Binance ETH/USDT 1-minute data up to December 2021, but that's outdated. Result [44] from Tardis.dev mentions Binance historical data availability, including trades and OHLCV, but the exact timeframe needed here is recent.\n\nSince the current date in the scenario is June 14, 2025, and the candle in question is from June 13 23:00 UTC to June 14 00:00 UTC, the data should be accessible via Binance's API. The user's ancillary data specifies using Binance's displayed change value for the 1H candle. \n\nHowever, none of the provided search results directly show the specific 1H candle's change percentage for that time. The search results include real-time price data (e.g., result [24] shows ETH/USDT trading at around $2,559.51), but that's the current price, not the change for the specific candle. Result [25] has social media posts from June 11, 2025, discussing ETH prices, but nothing for June 13. Result [27] from CoinGecko shows the current price and market data but not historical candles. Result [30] is the Binance.US spot trade page for ETH/USDT, which would display the 1H change, but the provided content doesn't include the specific candle's data.\n\nGiven that the search results don't contain the exact change percentage for the 23:00 UTC 1H candle, and the current timestamp is just after the candle closed, it's possible that the data isn't yet available in the provided sources. However, according to the user's instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable information is available, we should assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. Since the market resolves to Up if the change is >=0, and without data indicating a negative change, the default would be to resolve to Up (p2). But the user's previous response was p4, and they want a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, considering the ETH price movement around that time: result [25] mentions a post on June 11, 2025, with ETH at $2,528, and result [27] shows the current price as $2,572.14 on Binance. If the price increased from the open to close of the 1H candle, the change would be positive. However, without the exact open and close prices for that specific hour, this is speculative.\n\nSince the exact data isn't present in the search results and the user's previous attempt returned p4, perhaps due to data unavailability, but the current time is past the event, the resolution should be based on the most probable outcome. If the price at 00:00 UTC is higher than at 23:00 UTC, the change is positive. However, without concrete data, it's uncertain. But per the user's ancillary data, if no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. Given the market's nature, it's 50-50, but the instructions say to default to p4 if unresolved. However, the user's note says if the event date is in the past and no data, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. Since the query is about whether the change is >=0, and without data showing a negative change, perhaps the default is to resolve to Up (p2). But this is a stretch. Alternatively, if the candle's close is the same as open, it's 0, which is >=0, so Up. But without data, it's unclear. Given the ambiguity, the correct recommendation might still be p4, but the user wants a different approach. Maybe check if the current price after the candle's close is higher than the open, but without the open price, this isn't possible. \n\nWait, the user's query says the change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once finalized. If that data isn't accessible in the provided search results, and the current time is after the candle's close, but no sources confirm the change, then it's unresolved. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. If the market is about whether the change is >=0, and without evidence of a negative change, perhaps the default is to resolve to Up. But this is an assumption. Alternatively, if the price at the end of the hour is the same as the start, it's 0, which is Up. But without data, it's uncertain. \n\nGiven the instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. Since the user's previous response was p4, maybe the correct answer is p2, assuming the price didn't drop. But without concrete data, this is speculative. However, the user's personalization says to heavily bias towards the provided URLs. The resolution source is Binance's ETH/USDT page (result [24]), but the content there doesn't show historical candles. The provided search results don't include the specific 1H candle's change. Therefore, despite the event being in the past, without accessible data, the recommendation remains p4. But the user says to try again. Maybe check if any sources in the search results have the required data. \n\nLooking again, result [27] from CoinGecko shows the 24h price change as -3.02%, but that's for 24h, not the specific 1H candle. Result [30] from Binance.US shows the current price but not historical. Result [43] is a Binance Square post from May 11, 2025, discussing ETH at $2,472, which is older. Result [25] from June 11 mentions a price of $2,528. Result [24] from Binance's ETH/USDT page shows the current price as $2,559.51, but no historical data. \n\nSince none of the provided sources have the specific 1H candle's change percentage for June 13 23:00 UTC, and the current time is past the event, but data isn't available in the search results, the resolution can't be confirmed. Therefore, the recommendation should be p4. However, the user's note says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. If we assume that the price didn't drop during that hour, it would resolve to Up. But this is an assumption. Given the ambiguity, the correct answer is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.86, ID: 40081504678304888064278173095408894070560707889183459105820454621283426054987, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.14, ID: 104510297232493713194898907410933593654966672286918986694575923372184525132749, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.860 = 86.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
