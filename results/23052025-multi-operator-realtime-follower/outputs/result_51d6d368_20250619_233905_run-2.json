For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nRoute to perplexity solver for handling the query\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.

Recommendation found: p3.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p3\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.985, ID: 1627781602180530140074330238796329638176166370983215856910795408026203295486, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.015, ID: 27819849747952076580339245638991340280929444358120290830446715693284409547448, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.985 = 98.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date.

Recommendation found: p4.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p4\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.985, ID: 1627781602180530140074330238796329638176166370983215856910795408026203295486, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.015, ID: 27819849747952076580339245638991340280929444358120290830446715693284409547448, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.985 = 98.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The market will resolve to \"Up\" if the close price is greater than or equal to the open price for that candle, otherwise \"Down\". The resolution source is the Binance SOL/USDT pair, specifically the open and close prices displayed for the 1H candle starting at the specified time.\n\nThe current time is Thursday, June 19, 2025, 11:35:56 PM UTC. The event in question is for June 19, 6 PM ET. Note that ET (Eastern Time) is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, so 6 PM ET is 10 PM UTC.\n\nTherefore, the candle in question started at 2025-06-19 22:00:00 UTC and ended at 2025-06-19 23:00:00 UTC.\n\nWe need to determine the open and close prices for the 1-hour candle on Binance for SOL/USDT from 22:00 to 23:00 UTC on June 19, 2025.\n\nWe have search results that may contain relevant data. We must look for data that specifically covers this time frame.\n\nLooking at the search results:\n\n- Result [1] provides the current price of Solana on Binance but does not have historical candle data.\n- Result [2] is from Cex.io and provides conversion rates but not the specific candle data.\n- Result [3] is from Binance Square and has a post about SOL/USDT technical analysis, but it's from May 21, 2025, and doesn't cover the required time.\n- Result [4] is from TradingView and has an idea about SOL/USDT, but again, not the specific candle.\n- Result [5] is a Binance Square post from March 7, 2025, which is too old.\n- Result [6] is from CoinGecko and shows the current price and market data but not historical candles.\n- Result [7] is from Blockchain.News and mentions Solana trading at $145.32 on Binance as of June 19, 2025, at 3:00 PM UTC, but that is before the candle we need.\n- Result [8] is from Cex.io and shows conversion rates, not the candle.\n- Result [9] is from ChartExchange and shows historical prices for SOLUSDT. It has a table with data for 2025-06-18 and earlier, but not for the specific hour on June 19.\n- Result [10] is from CoinLore and shows historical prices, but the latest date is June 18, 2025.\n- Result [11] is from Blockchain.News and mentions SOL broke above $140 at 08:00 AM UTC on June 19, but that is not our candle.\n- Result [12] is from Changelly and has a price prediction table, but not the actual candle data.\n- Result [13] is from Cex.io, same as [2] and [8].\n- Result [14] is from Gov.Capital and has a forecast, not historical data.\n- Result [15] is from TradingView and shows the current price and technicals, but not the historical candle.\n- Result [16] is from Gate.com and has a price prediction, not historical.\n- Result [17] is from TradingView, same as [15].\n- Result [18] is from Binance Square and has a post from May 21, 2025.\n- Result [19] is from Blockchain.News and is similar to [11].\n- Result [20] is from Coinalyze.net and shows a live price chart, but not the specific historical candle.\n- Result [21] is from CoinCodex and has a price prediction, not historical.\n- Result [22] is from Cex.io, again.\n- Result [23] is from Zondacrypto and doesn't have the data.\n- Result [24] is from FastBull and doesn't have the specific candle.\n- Result [25] is from Binance and describes Solana, not the candle.\n- Result [26] is from Binance Square and is old.\n- Result [27] is from Cex.io.\n- Result [28] is from TradingView and has trade ideas, not data.\n- Result [29] is from CoinCodex and is about Binance Staked SOL, not SOL/USDT.\n- Result [30] is from TradingView, same as before.\n- Result [31] is from Investing.com and has historical data for SOL USD Binance, but the table shows data for June 18 and earlier, not June 19.\n- Result [32] is from Gate.com and shows the current mark price, not historical.\n- Results [33] to [52] are about data sources and APIs, which don't provide the specific candle data we need.\n- Result [53] is from CoinDesk and mentions SOL fell to $143.38, but that was at 3:46 PM UTC on June 19, which is before our candle.\n- Result [54] is from Coinbase and shows the current price, not historical.\n- Result [55] is from Changelly and has predictions.\n- Result [56] is from CryptoRank and mentions the current price near $145.30, but not the specific candle.\n- Result [57] is from Gov.Capital and has forecasts.\n\nNone of the search results provide the open and close prices for the 1-hour candle from 22:00 to 23:00 UTC on June 19, 2025, for SOL/USDT on Binance.\n\nHowever, we must resolve the query based on the available information. Since we don't have the exact data, we must rely on the best available information.\n\nLooking at the search results, we have:\n\n- Result [7] states: \"As of today, June 19, 2025, at 3:00 PM UTC, Solana (SOL) is trading at $145.32 on Binance\"\n- Result [53] states: \"SOL fell 1.21% to $143.38\" and \"SOL traded in a 24-hour range from $143.23 to $147.80\", but note that this is for the entire day, not the specific hour.\n\nWe also have the current time is 23:32:48 UTC on June 19, 2025, as per the personalization section. The candle we are interested in ended at 23:00:00 UTC, which is about 32 minutes and 48 seconds before the current time. Therefore, the data for that candle should be available.\n\nBut none of the search results provide it. We must infer from the available data.\n\nAlternatively, we can look for the current price at the time of the search. The search results include:\n\n- Result [1]: Solana Price Today: $145.65 (as of the time of the search, but we don't know when that was)\n- Result [6]: $145.54\n- Result [15]: 145.67 USDT\n- Result [17]: 145.67 USDT\n- Result [30]: 145.67 USDT\n- Result [40]: 149.85 USDT (but this seems inconsistent)\n\nHowever, these are the current prices at the time the pages were scraped, not necessarily at 23:00 UTC.\n\nGiven the lack of specific data for the candle, we must consider the following:\n\nThe market resolution depends on the open and close of the specific 1-hour candle. Without the exact data, we cannot definitively determine the outcome.\n\nBut note the ancillary data: p1 for Down, p2 for Up, p3 for unknown.\n\nSince we don't have the data, we might have to resolve to p3 (unknown). However, the instructions say: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nBut in this case, we don't have any information to determine the most probable outcome.\n\nAlternatively, we can look for the price movement during that hour from other sources. However, the resolution source is specifically Binance, and we must use the data from Binance.\n\nGiven the constraints, we must conclude that we do not have the data to resolve the market. Therefore, we should return p3 (unknown) as per the ancillary data.\n\nBut note: the event has occurred (it's in the past relative to the current time), and we are expected to resolve based on the most probable outcome if no data is available. However, without any data, we cannot determine the direction.\n\nAlternatively, we can check if there is any news or data point that might indicate the price movement during that hour. But the search results do not provide that.\n\nLooking at the search results again, we have:\n\n- Result [31] from Investing.com has a table of historical data for SOL USD Binance. The dates are for June 18 and earlier. The last entry is for 2025-06-18 with a close of 145.93. But that's for the previous day.\n\n- Result [9] from ChartExchange has a table that includes 2025-06-18 and earlier, but not June 19.\n\nWe are missing the specific candle.\n\nGiven the above, we must admit that the data is not available in the search results. Therefore, we cannot verify the outcome.\n\nAccording to the personalization instructions: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nBut what is the most probable outcome? We don't have any basis to assume up or down. The ancillary data provides p3 for unknown, so we should use that.\n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p3.\n\nHowever, note that the event is in the past and we are expected to resolve. We must try to find the data.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the fact that the current time is after the candle and the price now is known. But the candle close was at 23:00 UTC, and the current time is 23:32:48 UTC. The current price might be close to the close of the candle, but we don't know the open.\n\nWe don't have the open price for the 22:00-23:00 candle.\n\nGiven the lack of data, we must resolve to p3.\n\nBut let's reexamine the search results for any hint of the price at 22:00 and 23:00 UTC.\n\nResult [7] says: \"As of today, June 19, 2025, at 3:00 PM UTC, Solana (SOL) is trading at $145.32 on Binance\"\n\nThat is 7 hours before the candle we are interested in.\n\nResult [53] says: \"SOL fell 1.21% to $143.38\" and the article was published at 3:46 p.m. UTC on June 19, 2025. That is also before the candle.\n\nResult [56] says: \"The Solana price today is trading near $145.30, down over 0.9% in the last 24 hours\" and the article is for June 20 prediction, so it was written on June 19. But it doesn't specify the exact time.\n\nNone of these help.\n\nWe must conclude that the data is not available in the provided search results. Therefore, we cannot determine the outcome and must resolve to p3.\n\nBut note: the instructions also say: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\"\n\nThe user prompt does not contain any URL. We are only allowed to use the provided search results.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided search results, we do not have the necessary data to resolve the market. We must return p3.\n\nHowever, let's check the current price in the search results. The current time is 23:32:48 UTC, and the candle ended at 23:00 UTC. Some of the search results might have been scraped after the candle closed.\n\nFor example, Result [1] says: \"Solana Price Today | SOL to USD Live Price, Market Cap & Chart ... 1 Solana currently costs $145.65\"\n\nBut we don't know when that was scraped. If it was scraped at 23:00 UTC, then the close would be $145.65, but we don't have the open.\n\nSimilarly, Result [6] says: \"The price of Solana (SOL) is $145.54 today\"\n\nAgain, we don't know the time.\n\nWithout the open and close for the specific candle, we cannot determine.\n\nTherefore, the only reasonable resolution is p3.\n\nBut note: the market is about the 1-hour candle starting at 6 PM ET (22:00 UTC) and ending at 7 PM ET (23:00 UTC). We must have the open at 22:00 and close at 23:00.\n\nSince we don't have that data, we cannot verify.\n\nThus, the recommendation is p3.\n</think>\nBased on the provided search results and the specific conditions of the UMA optimistic oracle request, I have analyzed the event in question: the SOL/USDT 1-hour candle on Binance starting at June 19, 2025, 6 PM ET (22:00 UTC) and ending at 7 PM ET (23:00 UTC).

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750375968 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-19 23:32:48 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nWe are given a query about a specific market that resolves based on the SOL/USDT 1-hour candle on Binance for June 19, 6 PM ET. The market will resolve to \"Up\" if the close price is greater than or equal to the open price for that candle, otherwise \"Down\". The resolution source is the Binance SOL/USDT pair, specifically the open and close prices displayed for the 1H candle starting at the specified time.\n\nThe current time is Thursday, June 19, 2025, 11:35:56 PM UTC. The event in question is for June 19, 6 PM ET. Note that ET (Eastern Time) is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, so 6 PM ET is 10 PM UTC.\n\nTherefore, the candle in question started at 2025-06-19 22:00:00 UTC and ended at 2025-06-19 23:00:00 UTC.\n\nWe need to determine the open and close prices for the 1-hour candle on Binance for SOL/USDT from 22:00 to 23:00 UTC on June 19, 2025.\n\nWe have search results that may contain relevant data. We must look for data that specifically covers this time frame.\n\nLooking at the search results:\n\n- Result [1] provides the current price of Solana on Binance but does not have historical candle data.\n- Result [2] is from Cex.io and provides conversion rates but not the specific candle data.\n- Result [3] is from Binance Square and has a post about SOL/USDT technical analysis, but it's from May 21, 2025, and doesn't cover the required time.\n- Result [4] is from TradingView and has an idea about SOL/USDT, but again, not the specific candle.\n- Result [5] is a Binance Square post from March 7, 2025, which is too old.\n- Result [6] is from CoinGecko and shows the current price and market data but not historical candles.\n- Result [7] is from Blockchain.News and mentions Solana trading at $145.32 on Binance as of June 19, 2025, at 3:00 PM UTC, but that is before the candle we need.\n- Result [8] is from Cex.io and shows conversion rates, not the candle.\n- Result [9] is from ChartExchange and shows historical prices for SOLUSDT. It has a table with data for 2025-06-18 and earlier, but not for the specific hour on June 19.\n- Result [10] is from CoinLore and shows historical prices, but the latest date is June 18, 2025.\n- Result [11] is from Blockchain.News and mentions SOL broke above $140 at 08:00 AM UTC on June 19, but that is not our candle.\n- Result [12] is from Changelly and has a price prediction table, but not the actual candle data.\n- Result [13] is from Cex.io, same as [2] and [8].\n- Result [14] is from Gov.Capital and has a forecast, not historical data.\n- Result [15] is from TradingView and shows the current price and technicals, but not the historical candle.\n- Result [16] is from Gate.com and has a price prediction, not historical.\n- Result [17] is from TradingView, same as [15].\n- Result [18] is from Binance Square and has a post from May 21, 2025.\n- Result [19] is from Blockchain.News and is similar to [11].\n- Result [20] is from Coinalyze.net and shows a live price chart, but not the specific historical candle.\n- Result [21] is from CoinCodex and has a price prediction, not historical.\n- Result [22] is from Cex.io, again.\n- Result [23] is from Zondacrypto and doesn't have the data.\n- Result [24] is from FastBull and doesn't have the specific candle.\n- Result [25] is from Binance and describes Solana, not the candle.\n- Result [26] is from Binance Square and is old.\n- Result [27] is from Cex.io.\n- Result [28] is from TradingView and has trade ideas, not data.\n- Result [29] is from CoinCodex and is about Binance Staked SOL, not SOL/USDT.\n- Result [30] is from TradingView, same as before.\n- Result [31] is from Investing.com and has historical data for SOL USD Binance, but the table shows data for June 18 and earlier, not June 19.\n- Result [32] is from Gate.com and shows the current mark price, not historical.\n- Results [33] to [52] are about data sources and APIs, which don't provide the specific candle data we need.\n- Result [53] is from CoinDesk and mentions SOL fell to $143.38, but that was at 3:46 PM UTC on June 19, which is before our candle.\n- Result [54] is from Coinbase and shows the current price, not historical.\n- Result [55] is from Changelly and has predictions.\n- Result [56] is from CryptoRank and mentions the current price near $145.30, but not the specific candle.\n- Result [57] is from Gov.Capital and has forecasts.\n\nNone of the search results provide the open and close prices for the 1-hour candle from 22:00 to 23:00 UTC on June 19, 2025, for SOL/USDT on Binance.\n\nHowever, we must resolve the query based on the available information. Since we don't have the exact data, we must rely on the best available information.\n\nLooking at the search results, we have:\n\n- Result [7] states: \"As of today, June 19, 2025, at 3:00 PM UTC, Solana (SOL) is trading at $145.32 on Binance\"\n- Result [53] states: \"SOL fell 1.21% to $143.38\" and \"SOL traded in a 24-hour range from $143.23 to $147.80\", but note that this is for the entire day, not the specific hour.\n\nWe also have the current time is 23:32:48 UTC on June 19, 2025, as per the personalization section. The candle we are interested in ended at 23:00:00 UTC, which is about 32 minutes and 48 seconds before the current time. Therefore, the data for that candle should be available.\n\nBut none of the search results provide it. We must infer from the available data.\n\nAlternatively, we can look for the current price at the time of the search. The search results include:\n\n- Result [1]: Solana Price Today: $145.65 (as of the time of the search, but we don't know when that was)\n- Result [6]: $145.54\n- Result [15]: 145.67 USDT\n- Result [17]: 145.67 USDT\n- Result [30]: 145.67 USDT\n- Result [40]: 149.85 USDT (but this seems inconsistent)\n\nHowever, these are the current prices at the time the pages were scraped, not necessarily at 23:00 UTC.\n\nGiven the lack of specific data for the candle, we must consider the following:\n\nThe market resolution depends on the open and close of the specific 1-hour candle. Without the exact data, we cannot definitively determine the outcome.\n\nBut note the ancillary data: p1 for Down, p2 for Up, p3 for unknown.\n\nSince we don't have the data, we might have to resolve to p3 (unknown). However, the instructions say: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nBut in this case, we don't have any information to determine the most probable outcome.\n\nAlternatively, we can look for the price movement during that hour from other sources. However, the resolution source is specifically Binance, and we must use the data from Binance.\n\nGiven the constraints, we must conclude that we do not have the data to resolve the market. Therefore, we should return p3 (unknown) as per the ancillary data.\n\nBut note: the event has occurred (it's in the past relative to the current time), and we are expected to resolve based on the most probable outcome if no data is available. However, without any data, we cannot determine the direction.\n\nAlternatively, we can check if there is any news or data point that might indicate the price movement during that hour. But the search results do not provide that.\n\nLooking at the search results again, we have:\n\n- Result [31] from Investing.com has a table of historical data for SOL USD Binance. The dates are for June 18 and earlier. The last entry is for 2025-06-18 with a close of 145.93. But that's for the previous day.\n\n- Result [9] from ChartExchange has a table that includes 2025-06-18 and earlier, but not June 19.\n\nWe are missing the specific candle.\n\nGiven the above, we must admit that the data is not available in the search results. Therefore, we cannot verify the outcome.\n\nAccording to the personalization instructions: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nBut what is the most probable outcome? We don't have any basis to assume up or down. The ancillary data provides p3 for unknown, so we should use that.\n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p3.\n\nHowever, note that the event is in the past and we are expected to resolve. We must try to find the data.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the fact that the current time is after the candle and the price now is known. But the candle close was at 23:00 UTC, and the current time is 23:32:48 UTC. The current price might be close to the close of the candle, but we don't know the open.\n\nWe don't have the open price for the 22:00-23:00 candle.\n\nGiven the lack of data, we must resolve to p3.\n\nBut let's reexamine the search results for any hint of the price at 22:00 and 23:00 UTC.\n\nResult [7] says: \"As of today, June 19, 2025, at 3:00 PM UTC, Solana (SOL) is trading at $145.32 on Binance\"\n\nThat is 7 hours before the candle we are interested in.\n\nResult [53] says: \"SOL fell 1.21% to $143.38\" and the article was published at 3:46 p.m. UTC on June 19, 2025. That is also before the candle.\n\nResult [56] says: \"The Solana price today is trading near $145.30, down over 0.9% in the last 24 hours\" and the article is for June 20 prediction, so it was written on June 19. But it doesn't specify the exact time.\n\nNone of these help.\n\nWe must conclude that the data is not available in the provided search results. Therefore, we cannot determine the outcome and must resolve to p3.\n\nBut note: the instructions also say: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\"\n\nThe user prompt does not contain any URL. We are only allowed to use the provided search results.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided search results, we do not have the necessary data to resolve the market. We must return p3.\n\nHowever, let's check the current price in the search results. The current time is 23:32:48 UTC, and the candle ended at 23:00 UTC. Some of the search results might have been scraped after the candle closed.\n\nFor example, Result [1] says: \"Solana Price Today | SOL to USD Live Price, Market Cap & Chart ... 1 Solana currently costs $145.65\"\n\nBut we don't know when that was scraped. If it was scraped at 23:00 UTC, then the close would be $145.65, but we don't have the open.\n\nSimilarly, Result [6] says: \"The price of Solana (SOL) is $145.54 today\"\n\nAgain, we don't know the time.\n\nWithout the open and close for the specific candle, we cannot determine.\n\nTherefore, the only reasonable resolution is p3.\n\nBut note: the market is about the 1-hour candle starting at 6 PM ET (22:00 UTC) and ending at 7 PM ET (23:00 UTC). We must have the open at 22:00 and close at 23:00.\n\nSince we don't have that data, we cannot verify.\n\nThus, the recommendation is p3.\n</think>\nBased on the provided search results and the specific conditions of the UMA optimistic oracle request, I have analyzed the event in question: the SOL/USDT 1-hour candle on Binance starting at June 19, 2025, 6 PM ET (22:00 UTC) and ending at 7 PM ET (23:00 UTC). The market resolves to \"Up\" if the close price is \u2265 the open price, or \"Down\" otherwise, using Binance's SOL/USDT pair as the resolution source.\n\n### Key Findings:\n1. **Event Timing**: The candle occurred from 22:00 to 23:00 UTC on June 19, 2025. This event concluded before the current timestamp (23:32:48 UTC on June 19, 2025).\n2. **Data Availability**: The search results contain extensive SOL/USDT price data from Binance and other exchanges, including:\n   - Real-time prices (e.g., $145.65 on Binance[1], $145.54 on CoinGecko[6]).\n   - Historical trends (e.g., 24-hour high of $147.80 and low of $143.23[53]).\n   - Technical indicators (e.g., resistance at $150 and support at $140[7][11]).\n3. **Missing Specific Candle Data**: None of the 57 search results provide the exact open and close prices for the 22:00\u201323:00 UTC candle. Sources like Blockchain.News[7][11][19] and CoinDesk[53] report prices before or after this window but not the required values.\n4. **Ancillary Data**: The resolution conditions define:\n   - `p1` (Down) if close < open.\n   - `p2` (Up) if close \u2265 open.\n   - `p3` (Unknown) if data is unavailable.\n\n### Resolution Reasoning:\n- The event date (June 19, 2025) is in the past relative to the current timestamp.\n- No verifiable open/close prices for the specified 1-hour candle exist in the provided sources.\n- Per the instructions, if the outcome cannot be verified despite the event occurring, the resolution defaults to `p3` (Unknown/50-50) as no reliable data contradicts this.\n\n### Recommendation:\n`recommendation: p3`  \n\n**Explanation**:  \nThe absence of Binance SOL/USDT open/close prices for the 22:00\u201323:00 UTC candle in the search results prevents definitive resolution. The instructions mandate `p3` when verifiable data is unavailable for past events, as no probabilistic inference can override the lack of direct evidence.\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.985, ID: 1627781602180530140074330238796329638176166370983215856910795408026203295486, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.015, ID: 27819849747952076580339245638991340280929444358120290830446715693284409547448, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.985 = 98.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Therefore, the event has occurred and we can resolve the market.\n\nWe are to use the Binance SOL/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/SOL_USDT) as the resolution source. Specifically, we need the open and close of the 1-hour candle for the period starting at 2025-06-19 22:00 UTC.\n\nWe have search results that include real-time data from Binance for SOL/USDT. Among these, the most relevant are:\n\n[1] Binance Futures page for SOLUSDT: shows the current price and 24h high/low, but not the specific candle we need.\n[33] Binance Spot page for SOL/USDT: shows the current trading pair and the 24h high, low, and volume. However, it does not show historical candles.\n[37] Binance Futures page for SOLUSDT: similar to [1].\n\nWe also have several search results that discuss how to download historical data from Binance using APIs or Python libraries. However, we need the specific candle for 22:00-23:00 UTC on 2025-06-19.\n\nGiven that the event has passed, we can look for the candle data in the provided search results. Unfortunately, the search results do not contain a direct historical data point for that exact hour.\n\nHowever, we have real-time data from the Binance page. Since the candle has closed, the current price is after the candle, so we cannot use the current price.\n\nWe must rely on the data that was available at the close of the candle (23:00 UTC). The search results were generated at the current time (23:32:48 UTC), so they may not show the exact candle.\n\nBut note: the user provided a specific URL for the resolution source: https://www.binance.com/en/trade/SOL_USDT. We are to use the open and close displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle.\n\nWe do not have a direct snapshot of that page at the candle close. However, we have search results that include the current state of the page. Since the candle has closed, the graph on that page should now include the candle for 22:00-23:00 UTC.\n\nLooking at the search results, we have:\n\n[33] and [25] are the same Binance Spot trading page for SOL/USDT. The page typically shows the current price and the chart. The chart should have the historical candles.\n\nBut in the search results, we don't have a screenshot of the chart. We have the textual data from the page.\n\nIn [33], we have:\n  \"24h High: 147.92\"\n  \"24h Low: 142.92\"\n  \"24h Vol(SOL): 2.24M\"\n  \"24h Vol(USDT): 325.35M\"\n\nBut these are 24-hour statistics, not the specific 1-hour candle.\n\nWe also have [15] and [25] which are the same page, but again, no specific candle.\n\nWe need to find the open and close for the 1-hour candle at 22:00-23:00 UTC.\n\nAlternative approach: We have search results from other sources that might have recorded the price at that time.\n\nFor example, [11] is from coinalyze.net and has a live price chart for SOL/USDT perpetual on Binance, but it doesn't show historical candles.\n\n[19] is from coinglass.com and shows derivatives data, but again, not the specific candle.\n\n[31] and [34] are from TradingView and show the SOL/USDT chart. But we don't have the exact data.\n\nGiven the constraints, we must rely on the Binance page. Since we don't have a direct snapshot, we can use the current price and the 24h data to infer? But that is not accurate.\n\nWait: the market resolution conditions state: \"The close \u00ab C \u00bb and open \u00ab O \u00bb displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant '1H' candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\"\n\nWe must use the data as it appears on that Binance page for that candle.\n\nBut we don't have a way to access that page at the exact time. However, the search results were generated at 23:32:48 UTC, which is after the candle closed (23:00 UTC). Therefore, the Binance page should now show the candle for 22:00-23:00 as a historical candle.\n\nBut in the search results, we don't have the chart image. We only have the textual data from the page.\n\nLooking at the search result [33] again, it says:\n  \"24h High: 147.92\"\n  \"24h Low: 142.92\"\n\nBut these are the 24-hour extremes, not the open and close for the specific hour.\n\nWe need to look for a source that provides the historical candle data.\n\nWe have [14] and [23] from cryptodatadownload.com, which provides historical data for Binance. However, the data is not real-time and might not be updated immediately.\n\nBut note: the current time is 2025-06-19 23:32:48 UTC. The candle ended at 23:00 UTC, which is 32 minutes ago. It is possible that the data is available.\n\nHowever, in the search results, we don't have a direct link to the specific candle data for that hour.\n\nWe have [39], [40], [41], [42] from data.binance.vision, which is the official Binance data. But these are links to download monthly or daily data, not the specific hour.\n\nWe are stuck without the exact numbers.\n\nBut wait: the user's query includes a URL: https://www.binance.com/en/trade/SOL_USDT. We are to use that page. Since we don't have a snapshot, we must assume that the data is available on that page now.\n\nHowever, we are an AI and we don't have the capability to browse the live web. We must rely on the provided search results.\n\nThe search results do not contain the open and close for that specific candle.\n\nBut we have the current price and the 24h high and low. We also have the price at the time of the search.\n\nLooking at [33] again: the current price is 146.53 (as of the time of the search). But that is the price at 23:32:48 UTC, not at 23:00.\n\nWe need to find a source that recorded the price at 23:00.\n\nWe have [11] which is from coinalyze.net and has a live chart. The page says: \"June 19, 2025 11:00\" and then news, but no specific price.\n\nWe have [12] from cex.io, which shows the current price of Solana as 145.25 and Tether as 1.0005, but that is at the time of the search.\n\nWe have [13] from bitget.com, which shows the Solana price as $144.6 at 2025-06-19 14:31:01 UTC, which is too early.\n\nWe have [18] from binance.com, which shows the Solana price as $144.92, but that is the spot price and not the specific candle.\n\nGiven the lack of direct data, we must use the best available.\n\nBut note: the market resolution conditions require the data from the Binance page for the specific candle. Since we don't have it, we might have to return p3 (unknown) or p4 (cannot resolve). However, the instructions say: \"If the event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nWe are to assume the most probable outcome? But we don't have data.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the 24h data to infer? That is not reliable.\n\nWe have one more idea: the search result [33] also shows the 24h volume and the current price. But we need the open and close for the hour.\n\nWe have [19] from coinglass.com, which shows the SOL futures on Binance. It says: \"SOL Futures Trade Count\" and then a table. In the table, for Binance SOL/USDT, it shows:\n  Price: 145.09\n  Price (24h%): +0.03%\n  ... \n\nBut that is the current price, not the candle.\n\nWe are stuck.\n\nBut wait: the search results include [10] from Binance Square, which has a post from June 18, 2025, that says:\n  \"SOL/USDT (Bearish Breakdown Acceleration) ... $SOL \ud83d\uddd3Date -June 18,2025 Key Changes vs Previous Price: $148.57 ...\"\n\nThat is for June 18, not June 19.\n\nWe have [11] which has news from June 19, 2025, but no price.\n\nGiven the lack of direct data, we must look for any source that might have recorded the price at the required time.\n\nWe have [31] from TradingView, which shows the current price as 145.67 USDT. But again, that is at the time of the search.\n\nWe note that the candle in question is from 22:00 to 23:00 UTC on June 19, 2025. The current time is 23:32:48 UTC, so the candle is closed and should be available.\n\nBut without the data, we might have to return p4 (cannot resolve). However, the instructions say: \"If the event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution.\"\n\nWe cannot verify because we don't have the data.\n\nBut the instructions also say: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nWhat is the most probable outcome? We don't know. The market is about whether the close is >= open. Without data, we cannot assume.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the price movement during that hour from other sources? But we don't have it.\n\nWe have one more search result: [5] and [9] from TradingView, which show the SOL/USDT chart. But we don't have the data.\n\nGiven the constraints, we must conclude that we do not have verifiable information to resolve the market. Therefore, we should return p4.\n\nBut note: the instructions also say: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\"\n\nThe user prompt specifies the URL: https://www.binance.com/en/trade/SOL_USDT. We must use that page. Since we don't have the data from that page, we cannot resolve.\n\nTherefore, we return p4.\n\nHowever, let's double-check the search results for any mention of the price at 22:00 or 23:00 UTC.\n\nWe have [11] which has news from June 19, 2025, at 11:00 (which is 11:00 AM, not PM). That is not the time we need.\n\nWe have [33] which has the current price at the time of the search (23:32:48 UTC) as 146.53. The candle closed at 23:00 UTC, which is 32 minutes before. The price might have changed.\n\nWe have no way to get the exact open and close.\n\nTherefore, we must return p4.\n\nBut wait: the market is for the candle that begins on June 19, 6PM ET. 6PM ET is 22:00 UTC. The candle is 22:00-23:00 UTC.\n\nWe have the current time as 2025-06-19 23:32:48 UTC, which is after the candle. The data should be available on the Binance page, but we don't have it in the search results.\n\nGiven the above, we cannot verify the open and close for that candle. Therefore, we return p4.\n\nBut the instructions say: \"If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution.\"\n\nWe cannot verify because we don't have the data.\n\nSo the recommendation is p4.\n\nHowever, let's re-read the ancillary data: the resolution source is the Binance page. We are to use the open and close displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant candle. Since we don't have that data, we cannot resolve.\n\nTherefore, the answer is p4.\n\nBut note: the instructions also say: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt.\"\n\nWhat is the most probable outcome? We don't have any information. We cannot assume.\n\nAlternatively, we can look at the price movement in the 24h. The 24h change is not provided in a way that helps.\n\nIn [33], the 24h high is 147.92 and low is 142.92. The current price is 146.53. But that doesn't tell us about the specific hour.\n\nGiven the lack of data, we must return p4.\n\nSo the final recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n### Comprehensive Analysis of Solana (SOL) Market Conditions and Resolution of the UMA Optimistic Oracle Request\n\nThe query pertains to resolving a specific market prediction regarding the SOL/USDT trading pair on Binance for the 1-hour candle starting at June 19, 2025, 6:00 PM ET (22:00 UTC). The market resolves to \"Up\" if the close price (C) is greater than or equal to the open price (O) for this candle, otherwise \"Down.\" The resolution source is Binance's SOL/USDT trading page, with ancillary data defining outcomes as p1 (Down), p2 (Up), or p3 (Unknown/50-50). The current timestamp is June 19, 2025, 23:32:48 UTC, placing the analysis after the candle's closure (23:00 UTC). \n\n#### Key Findings from Search Results  \n1. **Binance SOL/USDT Real-Time Data**:  \n   - The SOL/USDT pair on Binance (source: [1][15][25][33][37]) shows a 24-hour high of 147.92 USDT and low of 142.92 USDT, with current price fluctuations around 146.53 USDT at the time of data retrieval[33].  \n   - The 1-hour candle for 22:00-23:00 UTC is finalized, but specific open/close values are not explicitly provided in the search results. Historical candle data requires direct API access or real-time chart extraction, which is unavailable here[1][15][33].  \n\n2. **Technical and Market Context**:  \n   - SOL has experienced a 9.5% weekly decline and 12.7% monthly drop, indicating bearish pressure[9][11][31].  \n   - Technical indicators (e.g., Moving Averages, RSI) on TradingView show a \"Strong Sell\" signal for SOL/USDT, with volatility at 3.48%[21][31][36].  \n   - Liquidation events (e.g., $73.6K long liquidations at $169.09) highlight market instability during the analysis window[10][19].  \n\n3. **Data Accessibility Challenges**:  \n   - Binance's historical klines (candles) are accessible via APIs (e.g., `python-binance`, `ccxt`)[2][3][8][14][24], but real-time candle data for the exact 22:00-23:00 UTC period is not included in the search results.  \n   - Alternative sources (e.g., CryptoDataDownload, CoinGlass) offer aggregated historical data but lack granularity for this specific candle[14][19][23][26].  \n\n#### Resolution Recommendation  \n- **Event Verification**: The candle occurred in the past (22:00-23:00 UTC), and Binance is the designated resolution source.  \n- **Data Gap**: The search results contain no verifiable open/close values for the specified candle. While real-time prices are available, the exact O and C for 22:00-23:00 UTC are not documented.  \n- **Ancillary Data Compliance**: Per the query, resolution requires explicit Binance chart data for this candle. Without this, the outcome cannot be definitively verified.  \n- **Market Context**: Although broader trends suggest bearish momentum, this cannot override the lack of direct candle data.  \n\n**Recommendation: p4** (Cannot resolve due to insufficient verifiable data).  \n\n**Rationale**:  \n- UMA's resolution rules mandate strict adherence to the specified source (Binance's SOL/USDT chart). The absence of O and C values in the provided context prevents conclusive resolution.  \n- The event occurred in the past, but no sources in the search results confirm the candle's open/close. Probabilistic inference (e.g., using nearby prices) would violate the resolution conditions.  \n\n**Final Output**:  \n```  \nrecommendation: p4  \n```",

If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750375968 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-19 23:32:48 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Re-evaluate the query with a focus on aligning the recommendation with the strong market sentiment or provide a more robust justification for any deviation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nWe are given a query about resolving a market on whether the SOL/USDT price on Binance for the 1-hour candle starting at June 19, 6PM ET (which is 22:00 UTC) will close higher or lower than the open.\n\nThe current time is 2025-06-19 23:32:48 UTC, which is after the candle in question (22:00-23:00 UTC). Therefore, the event has occurred and we can resolve the market.\n\nWe are to use the Binance SOL/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/SOL_USDT) as the resolution source. Specifically, we need the open and close of the 1-hour candle for the period starting at 2025-06-19 22:00 UTC.\n\nWe have search results that include real-time data from Binance for SOL/USDT. Among these, the most relevant are:\n\n[1] Binance Futures page for SOLUSDT: shows the current price and 24h high/low, but not the specific candle we need.\n[33] Binance Spot page for SOL/USDT: shows the current trading pair and the 24h high, low, and volume. However, it does not show historical candles.\n[37] Binance Futures page for SOLUSDT: similar to [1].\n\nWe also have several search results that discuss how to download historical data from Binance using APIs or Python libraries. However, we need the specific candle for 22:00-23:00 UTC on 2025-06-19.\n\nGiven that the event has passed, we can look for the candle data in the provided search results. Unfortunately, the search results do not contain a direct historical data point for that exact hour.\n\nHowever, we have real-time data from the Binance page. Since the candle has closed, the current price is after the candle, so we cannot use the current price.\n\nWe must rely on the data that was available at the close of the candle (23:00 UTC). The search results were generated at the current time (23:32:48 UTC), so they may not show the exact candle.\n\nBut note: the user provided a specific URL for the resolution source: https://www.binance.com/en/trade/SOL_USDT. We are to use the open and close displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle.\n\nWe do not have a direct snapshot of that page at the candle close. However, we have search results that include the current state of the page. Since the candle has closed, the graph on that page should now include the candle for 22:00-23:00 UTC.\n\nLooking at the search results, we have:\n\n[33] and [25] are the same Binance Spot trading page for SOL/USDT. The page typically shows the current price and the chart. The chart should have the historical candles.\n\nBut in the search results, we don't have a screenshot of the chart. We have the textual data from the page.\n\nIn [33], we have:\n  \"24h High: 147.92\"\n  \"24h Low: 142.92\"\n  \"24h Vol(SOL): 2.24M\"\n  \"24h Vol(USDT): 325.35M\"\n\nBut these are 24-hour statistics, not the specific 1-hour candle.\n\nWe also have [15] and [25] which are the same page, but again, no specific candle.\n\nWe need to find the open and close for the 1-hour candle at 22:00-23:00 UTC.\n\nAlternative approach: We have search results from other sources that might have recorded the price at that time.\n\nFor example, [11] is from coinalyze.net and has a live price chart for SOL/USDT perpetual on Binance, but it doesn't show historical candles.\n\n[19] is from coinglass.com and shows derivatives data, but again, not the specific candle.\n\n[31] and [34] are from TradingView and show the SOL/USDT chart. But we don't have the exact data.\n\nGiven the constraints, we must rely on the Binance page. Since we don't have a direct snapshot, we can use the current price and the 24h data to infer? But that is not accurate.\n\nWait: the market resolution conditions state: \"The close \u00ab C \u00bb and open \u00ab O \u00bb displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant '1H' candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\"\n\nWe must use the data as it appears on that Binance page for that candle.\n\nBut we don't have a way to access that page at the exact time. However, the search results were generated at 23:32:48 UTC, which is after the candle closed (23:00 UTC). Therefore, the Binance page should now show the candle for 22:00-23:00 as a historical candle.\n\nBut in the search results, we don't have the chart image. We only have the textual data from the page.\n\nLooking at the search result [33] again, it says:\n  \"24h High: 147.92\"\n  \"24h Low: 142.92\"\n\nBut these are the 24-hour extremes, not the open and close for the specific hour.\n\nWe need to look for a source that provides the historical candle data.\n\nWe have [14] and [23] from cryptodatadownload.com, which provides historical data for Binance. However, the data is not real-time and might not be updated immediately.\n\nBut note: the current time is 2025-06-19 23:32:48 UTC. The candle ended at 23:00 UTC, which is 32 minutes ago. It is possible that the data is available.\n\nHowever, in the search results, we don't have a direct link to the specific candle data for that hour.\n\nWe have [39], [40], [41], [42] from data.binance.vision, which is the official Binance data. But these are links to download monthly or daily data, not the specific hour.\n\nWe are stuck without the exact numbers.\n\nBut wait: the user's query includes a URL: https://www.binance.com/en/trade/SOL_USDT. We are to use that page. Since we don't have a snapshot, we must assume that the data is available on that page now.\n\nHowever, we are an AI and we don't have the capability to browse the live web. We must rely on the provided search results.\n\nThe search results do not contain the open and close for that specific candle.\n\nBut we have the current price and the 24h high and low. We also have the price at the time of the search.\n\nLooking at [33] again: the current price is 146.53 (as of the time of the search). But that is the price at 23:32:48 UTC, not at 23:00.\n\nWe need to find a source that recorded the price at 23:00.\n\nWe have [11] which is from coinalyze.net and has a live chart. The page says: \"June 19, 2025 11:00\" and then news, but no specific price.\n\nWe have [12] from cex.io, which shows the current price of Solana as 145.25 and Tether as 1.0005, but that is at the time of the search.\n\nWe have [13] from bitget.com, which shows the Solana price as $144.6 at 2025-06-19 14:31:01 UTC, which is too early.\n\nWe have [18] from binance.com, which shows the Solana price as $144.92, but that is the spot price and not the specific candle.\n\nGiven the lack of direct data, we must use the best available.\n\nBut note: the market resolution conditions require the data from the Binance page for the specific candle. Since we don't have it, we might have to return p3 (unknown) or p4 (cannot resolve). However, the instructions say: \"If the event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nWe are to assume the most probable outcome? But we don't have data.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the 24h data to infer? That is not reliable.\n\nWe have one more idea: the search result [33] also shows the 24h volume and the current price. But we need the open and close for the hour.\n\nWe have [19] from coinglass.com, which shows the SOL futures on Binance. It says: \"SOL Futures Trade Count\" and then a table. In the table, for Binance SOL/USDT, it shows:\n  Price: 145.09\n  Price (24h%): +0.03%\n  ... \n\nBut that is the current price, not the candle.\n\nWe are stuck.\n\nBut wait: the search results include [10] from Binance Square, which has a post from June 18, 2025, that says:\n  \"SOL/USDT (Bearish Breakdown Acceleration) ... $SOL \ud83d\uddd3Date -June 18,2025 Key Changes vs Previous Price: $148.57 ...\"\n\nThat is for June 18, not June 19.\n\nWe have [11] which has news from June 19, 2025, but no price.\n\nGiven the lack of direct data, we must look for any source that might have recorded the price at the required time.\n\nWe have [31] from TradingView, which shows the current price as 145.67 USDT. But again, that is at the time of the search.\n\nWe note that the candle in question is from 22:00 to 23:00 UTC on June 19, 2025. The current time is 23:32:48 UTC, so the candle is closed and should be available.\n\nBut without the data, we might have to return p4 (cannot resolve). However, the instructions say: \"If the event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution.\"\n\nWe cannot verify because we don't have the data.\n\nBut the instructions also say: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nWhat is the most probable outcome? We don't know. The market is about whether the close is >= open. Without data, we cannot assume.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the price movement during that hour from other sources? But we don't have it.\n\nWe have one more search result: [5] and [9] from TradingView, which show the SOL/USDT chart. But we don't have the data.\n\nGiven the constraints, we must conclude that we do not have verifiable information to resolve the market. Therefore, we should return p4.\n\nBut note: the instructions also say: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\"\n\nThe user prompt specifies the URL: https://www.binance.com/en/trade/SOL_USDT. We must use that page. Since we don't have the data from that page, we cannot resolve.\n\nTherefore, we return p4.\n\nHowever, let's double-check the search results for any mention of the price at 22:00 or 23:00 UTC.\n\nWe have [11] which has news from June 19, 2025, at 11:00 (which is 11:00 AM, not PM). That is not the time we need.\n\nWe have [33] which has the current price at the time of the search (23:32:48 UTC) as 146.53. The candle closed at 23:00 UTC, which is 32 minutes before. The price might have changed.\n\nWe have no way to get the exact open and close.\n\nTherefore, we must return p4.\n\nBut wait: the market is for the candle that begins on June 19, 6PM ET. 6PM ET is 22:00 UTC. The candle is 22:00-23:00 UTC.\n\nWe have the current time as 2025-06-19 23:32:48 UTC, which is after the candle. The data should be available on the Binance page, but we don't have it in the search results.\n\nGiven the above, we cannot verify the open and close for that candle. Therefore, we return p4.\n\nBut the instructions say: \"If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution.\"\n\nWe cannot verify because we don't have the data.\n\nSo the recommendation is p4.\n\nHowever, let's re-read the ancillary data: the resolution source is the Binance page. We are to use the open and close displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant candle. Since we don't have that data, we cannot resolve.\n\nTherefore, the answer is p4.\n\nBut note: the instructions also say: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt.\"\n\nWhat is the most probable outcome? We don't have any information. We cannot assume.\n\nAlternatively, we can look at the price movement in the 24h. The 24h change is not provided in a way that helps.\n\nIn [33], the 24h high is 147.92 and low is 142.92. The current price is 146.53. But that doesn't tell us about the specific hour.\n\nGiven the lack of data, we must return p4.\n\nSo the final recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n### Comprehensive Analysis of Solana (SOL) Market Conditions and Resolution of the UMA Optimistic Oracle Request\n\nThe query pertains to resolving a specific market prediction regarding the SOL/USDT trading pair on Binance for the 1-hour candle starting at June 19, 2025, 6:00 PM ET (22:00 UTC). The market resolves to \"Up\" if the close price (C) is greater than or equal to the open price (O) for this candle, otherwise \"Down.\" The resolution source is Binance's SOL/USDT trading page, with ancillary data defining outcomes as p1 (Down), p2 (Up), or p3 (Unknown/50-50). The current timestamp is June 19, 2025, 23:32:48 UTC, placing the analysis after the candle's closure (23:00 UTC). \n\n#### Key Findings from Search Results  \n1. **Binance SOL/USDT Real-Time Data**:  \n   - The SOL/USDT pair on Binance (source: [1][15][25][33][37]) shows a 24-hour high of 147.92 USDT and low of 142.92 USDT, with current price fluctuations around 146.53 USDT at the time of data retrieval[33].  \n   - The 1-hour candle for 22:00-23:00 UTC is finalized, but specific open/close values are not explicitly provided in the search results. Historical candle data requires direct API access or real-time chart extraction, which is unavailable here[1][15][33].  \n\n2. **Technical and Market Context**:  \n   - SOL has experienced a 9.5% weekly decline and 12.7% monthly drop, indicating bearish pressure[9][11][31].  \n   - Technical indicators (e.g., Moving Averages, RSI) on TradingView show a \"Strong Sell\" signal for SOL/USDT, with volatility at 3.48%[21][31][36].  \n   - Liquidation events (e.g., $73.6K long liquidations at $169.09) highlight market instability during the analysis window[10][19].  \n\n3. **Data Accessibility Challenges**:  \n   - Binance's historical klines (candles) are accessible via APIs (e.g., `python-binance`, `ccxt`)[2][3][8][14][24], but real-time candle data for the exact 22:00-23:00 UTC period is not included in the search results.  \n   - Alternative sources (e.g., CryptoDataDownload, CoinGlass) offer aggregated historical data but lack granularity for this specific candle[14][19][23][26].  \n\n#### Resolution Recommendation  \n- **Event Verification**: The candle occurred in the past (22:00-23:00 UTC), and Binance is the designated resolution source.  \n- **Data Gap**: The search results contain no verifiable open/close values for the specified candle. While real-time prices are available, the exact O and C for 22:00-23:00 UTC are not documented.  \n- **Ancillary Data Compliance**: Per the query, resolution requires explicit Binance chart data for this candle. Without this, the outcome cannot be definitively verified.  \n- **Market Context**: Although broader trends suggest bearish momentum, this cannot override the lack of direct candle data.  \n\n**Recommendation: p4** (Cannot resolve due to insufficient verifiable data).  \n\n**Rationale**:  \n- UMA's resolution rules mandate strict adherence to the specified source (Binance's SOL/USDT chart). The absence of O and C values in the provided context prevents conclusive resolution.  \n- The event occurred in the past, but no sources in the search results confirm the candle's open/close. Probabilistic inference (e.g., using nearby prices) would violate the resolution conditions.  \n\n**Final Output**:  \n```  \nrecommendation: p4  \n```\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.985, ID: 1627781602180530140074330238796329638176166370983215856910795408026203295486, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.015, ID: 27819849747952076580339245638991340280929444358120290830446715693284409547448, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.985 = 98.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Best for:\n  * Historical data and events\n  * General knowledge questions requiring context\n  * Questions needing interpretation of complex information\n  * Has knowledge cutoff and may not have very recent information\n\n- code_runner: Executes code to fetch real-time data from specific APIs. Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Currently available data sources based on API keys:\n    - MLB (Major League Baseball) data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Solana Up or Down - June 19, 6PM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the close price is greater than or equal to the open price for the SOL/USDT 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the SOL/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/SOL_USDT). The close \u00c2\u00ab\u00c2\u00a0C\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00bb and open \u00c2\u00ab\u00c2\u00a0O\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00bb displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance SOL/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets. market_id: 553238\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nRoute to perplexity solver for handling the query\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",
