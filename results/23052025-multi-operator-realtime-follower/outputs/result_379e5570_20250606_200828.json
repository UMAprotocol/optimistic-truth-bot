      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Legacy will qualify for Stage 2 of the BLAST.tv Austin Major. The resolution depends on official information from HLTV. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current status of the tournament. The current date is June 6, 2025, according to the system prompt. The Major's Stage 1 is from June 3rd to 6th, 2025, as per search result [4] and [26]. So today is the last day of Stage 1. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's a live blog from Day 4 of Stage 1 (result [5]) which mentions Legacy's match against Wildcard. Legacy won Inferno 13-10, and Wildcard needed to win both remaining maps (Nuke and Ancient) to qualify. However, there's no further update on the outcome of those maps. \n\nAnother result [47] from June 6th (Day 3) states that Legacy defeated Imperial 2-1, securing their survival and moving to a 2-2 bracket. Then, result [48] mentions Legacy faced TYLOO in a 2-2 elimination match. The outcome of that match isn't explicitly stated, but result [47] says Legacy would fight another day, implying they might have advanced.\n\nSearch result [39] from Liquipedia, updated on June 6th, shows Legacy's record as 2-2 with a round difference of -1. However, the top 8 teams from Stage 1 advance to Stage 2. If Legacy's final record after Round 5 is 3-2, they would qualify. \n\nResult [52] from June 4th mentions Legacy was at 1-2 and faced elimination but won their next match. Result [47] confirms Legacy's 2-1 victory over Imperial, moving them to 2-2. The final Round 5 matches on June 6th would determine if they reach 3-2. \n\nSince the current date is June 6th and the event hasn't been postponed or canceled, the resolution depends on Legacy's final standing. If they won their Round 5 match (making 3-2), they qualify. If they lost (2-3), they don't. \n\nHowever, the available search results don't explicitly confirm Legacy's final result in Round 5. But result [48] from June 5th mentions Legacy's match against TYLOO, and result [47] from June 6th says Legacy secured survival, suggesting they might have advanced. Without explicit confirmation, but considering the timeline and their progression to 2-2, it's possible they qualified. \n\nBut since the user's personalization requires resolving based on verified facts, and the sources don't definitively state Legacy's qualification, I should check HLTV's official event page (result [9], [25], [26]). However, the provided search results don't include the final standings. \n\nGiven the uncertainty and the requirement to resolve based on verified information, if Legacy's final match isn't concluded or reported in the sources, the answer would default to p4. But since the current timestamp is June 6th, and the event is ongoing, if the match hasn't happened yet, it's a future event. However, the system's current time is June 6th, 20:02:58 UTC, and the event's Stage 1 ends on June 6th. If the match occurred after the current time, it's still a future event, leading to p4. But if the match was completed before the timestamp, and Legacy qualified, it's p2. \n\nBut the search results don't provide the exact time of Legacy's final match. Result [5] mentions matches on June 6th, with Legacy vs. Wildcard at 13:45 CDT (18:45 UTC). If the system's time is 20:02 UTC, the match would have concluded, but the result isn't in the provided data. Without explicit confirmation, and adhering to the user's instruction to resolve based on available sources, if Legacy's qualification isn't verified, the answer would be p4. However, result [47] implies Legacy advanced, so perhaps they did qualify. \n\nWait, result [47] says Legacy secured survival by defeating Imperial, moving to 2-2, and then faced TYLOO. If they won that, they'd be 3-2. But the provided results don't confirm that. Therefore, without explicit confirmation, the resolution should be p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. Since the event date is today, and it's past the end date, but the exact match time isn't clear, it's tricky. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but considering Legacy's progression to 2-2 and the requirement to resolve based on available data, if they won their final match, it's p2. If not, p1. Since the sources don't confirm, but the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome if the event is in the past. Since the event is on June 6th, which is the current date, but the exact match time isn't specified, it's possible the match hasn't occurred yet, leading to p4. However, the system's current time is 20:02 UTC, and the match might have already happened. \n\nThis is a bit conflicting. To adhere strictly to the guidelines, if the event is scheduled for a future date relative to the current timestamp, resolve p4. If the event date is in the past but no info, assume probable outcome. Since the event is on the same day, but the exact time isn't clear, and the system's time is 20:02 UTC, if the match was earlier, it's resolved; if later, p4. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit confirmation in the search results, and the requirement to use HLTV as the source, which isn't provided here, the safest resolution is p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume probable outcome. Since the event is today, and the day is over, but no info, perhaps Legacy didn't qualify. But this is uncertain. \n\nAlternatively, result [45] from March 24th lists Legacy in the South America MRQ, but that's prior to the Major. Result [28] from HLTV's team overview for Legacy shows their recent matches, including in the Major's Stage 1, but doesn't state their final standing. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and lack of explicit confirmation, but considering the user's instruction to resolve based on available sources, and if no info, answer as best as possible. Since Legacy was in the 2-2 bracket and needed to win their final match to advance, but there's no confirmation, the resolution would be p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. If Legacy was 2-2, their chance to win the final match is 50-50, but the ancillary data defines p3 as 0.5, but the resolution conditions map p3 to 0.5, but the user's resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5, but the market resolves to p1 or p2. \n\nWait, the resolution_conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 0.5. But the market resolves to Yes or No. If the event is over and no info, but the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome. If Legacy's most probable outcome is qualifying, then p2. But without data, it's unclear. \n\nGiven the search results, especially [47] and [48], which indicate Legacy was still in the running on June 6th but no final result, and the event's end date is June 6th, it's possible the match was completed. However, without explicit confirmation, the resolution should be p4. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume probable outcome. Since the event is on the current date, which is the same as the system's date, but the exact time isn't clear, it's a borderline case. \n\nIn conclusion, without explicit confirmation from HLTV, but considering the available data, it's safer to resolve to p4 as the event might still be ongoing or the result not yet reported. However, if the event has concluded and Legacy's result isn't confirmed, the resolution would be p1 (No) as per the market's default. But this is uncertain. Given the complexity, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

The user wants to know if Legacy will qualify for Stage 2 of the BLAST.tv Austin Major. The resolution depends on official information from HLTV. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current status of the tournament. The current date is June 6, 2025, according to the system prompt. The Major's Stage 1 is from June 3rd to 6th, 2025, as per search result [4] and [26]. So today is the last day of Stage 1. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's a live blog from Day 4 of Stage 1 (result [5]) which mentions Legacy's match against Wildcard. Legacy won Inferno 13-10, and Wildcard needed to win both remaining maps (Nuke and Ancient) to qualify. However, there's no further update on the outcome of those maps. \n\nAnother result [47] from June 6th (Day 3) states that Legacy defeated Imperial 2-1, securing their survival and moving to a 2-2 bracket. Then, result [48] mentions Legacy faced TYLOO in a 2-2 elimination match. The outcome of that match isn't explicitly stated, but result [47] says Legacy would fight another day, implying they might have advanced.\n\nSearch result [39] from Liquipedia, updated on June 6th, shows Legacy's record as 2-2 with a round difference of -1. However, the top 8 teams from Stage 1 advance to Stage 2. If Legacy's final record after Round 5 is 3-2, they would qualify. \n\nResult [52] from June 4th mentions Legacy was at 1-2 and faced elimination but won their next match. Result [47] confirms Legacy's 2-1 victory over Imperial, moving them to 2-2. The final Round 5 matches on June 6th would determine if they reach 3-2. \n\nSince the current date is June 6th and the event hasn't been postponed or canceled, the resolution depends on Legacy's final standing. If they won their Round 5 match (making 3-2), they qualify. If they lost (2-3), they don't. \n\nHowever, the available search results don't explicitly confirm Legacy's final result in Round 5. But result [48] from June 5th mentions Legacy's match against TYLOO, and result [47] from June 6th says Legacy secured survival, suggesting they might have advanced. Without explicit confirmation, but considering the timeline and their progression to 2-2, it's possible they qualified. \n\nBut since the user's personalization requires resolving based on verified facts, and the sources don't definitively state Legacy's qualification, I should check HLTV's official event page (result [9], [25], [26]). However, the provided search results don't include the final standings. \n\nGiven the uncertainty and the requirement to resolve based on verified information, if Legacy's final match isn't concluded or reported in the sources, the answer would default to p4. But since the current timestamp is June 6th, and the event is ongoing, if the match hasn't happened yet, it's a future event. However, the system's current time is June 6th, 20:02:58 UTC, and the event's Stage 1 ends on June 6th. If the match occurred after the current time, it's still a future event, leading to p4. But if the match was completed before the timestamp, and Legacy qualified, it's p2. \n\nBut the search results don't provide the exact time of Legacy's final match. Result [5] mentions matches on June 6th, with Legacy vs. Wildcard at 13:45 CDT (18:45 UTC). If the system's time is 20:02 UTC, the match would have concluded, but the result isn't in the provided data. Without explicit confirmation, and adhering to the user's instruction to resolve based on available sources, if Legacy's qualification isn't verified, the answer would be p4. However, result [47] implies Legacy advanced, so perhaps they did qualify. \n\nWait, result [47] says Legacy secured survival by defeating Imperial, moving to 2-2, and then faced TYLOO. If they won that, they'd be 3-2. But the provided results don't confirm that. Therefore, without explicit confirmation, the resolution should be p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. Since the event date is today, and it's past the end date, but the exact match time isn't clear, it's tricky. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but considering Legacy's progression to 2-2 and the requirement to resolve based on available data, if they won their final match, it's p2. If not, p1. Since the sources don't confirm, but the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome if the event is in the past. Since the event is on June 6th, which is the current date, but the exact match time isn't specified, it's possible the match hasn't occurred yet, leading to p4. However, the system's current time is 20:02 UTC, and the match might have already happened. \n\nThis is a bit conflicting. To adhere strictly to the guidelines, if the event is scheduled for a future date relative to the current timestamp, resolve p4. If the event date is in the past but no info, assume probable outcome. Since the event is on the same day, but the exact time isn't clear, and the system's time is 20:02 UTC, if the match was earlier, it's resolved; if later, p4. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit confirmation in the search results, and the requirement to use HLTV as the source, which isn't provided here, the safest resolution is p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume probable outcome. Since the event is today, and the day is over, but no info, perhaps Legacy didn't qualify. But this is uncertain. \n\nAlternatively, result [45] from March 24th lists Legacy in the South America MRQ, but that's prior to the Major. Result [28] from HLTV's team overview for Legacy shows their recent matches, including in the Major's Stage 1, but doesn't state their final standing. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and lack of explicit confirmation, but considering the user's instruction to resolve based on available sources, and if no info, answer as best as possible. Since Legacy was in the 2-2 bracket and needed to win their final match to advance, but there's no confirmation, the resolution would be p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. If Legacy was 2-2, their chance to win the final match is 50-50, but the ancillary data defines p3 as 0.5, but the resolution conditions map p3 to 0.5, but the user's resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5, but the market resolves to p1 or p2. \n\nWait, the resolution_conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 0.5. But the market resolves to Yes or No. If the event is over and no info, but the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome. If Legacy's most probable outcome is qualifying, then p2. But without data, it's unclear. \n\nGiven the search results, especially [47] and [48], which indicate Legacy was still in the running on June 6th but no final result, and the event's end date is June 6th, it's possible the match was completed. However, without explicit confirmation, the resolution should be p4. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume probable outcome. Since the event is on the current date, which is the same as the system's date, but the exact time isn't clear, it's a borderline case. \n\nIn conclusion, without explicit confirmation from HLTV, but considering the available data, it's safer to resolve to p4 as the event might still be ongoing or the result not yet reported. However, if the event has concluded and Legacy's result isn't confirmed, the resolution would be p1 (No) as per the market's default. But this is uncertain. Given the complexity, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.985, ID: 19558850603841930869214250776327322239696865566744758648974732917034512217464, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.015, ID: 67450674262845165102288800840764574804685459102338802409550363356656703342032, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.985 = 98.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
