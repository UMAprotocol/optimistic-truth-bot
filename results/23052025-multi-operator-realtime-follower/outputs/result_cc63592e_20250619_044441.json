      "response": "<think>\nWe are given a query about a market resolution regarding Karen Read's trial. The market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Karen Read is found guilty of either second-degree murder or manslaughter by vehicle while under the influence by December 31, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. Otherwise, it resolves to \"No\". The resolution conditions are: p1 for No, p2 for Yes, p3 for unknown/50-50.\n\nWe have multiple search results, including recent ones (as of June 19, 2025) that provide the verdict of the retrial. The retrial concluded on June 18, 2025, with the jury finding Karen Read not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter, but guilty of operating under the influence (OUI). However, note that the OUI conviction is a lesser charge and not the same as manslaughter by vehicle while under the influence.\n\nLet's break down the charges and the verdict:\n\n1. Second-degree murder: Not guilty (as per multiple sources, e.g., [8], [9], [14], [17], [18], [19])\n2. Manslaughter while operating a motor vehicle under the influence: Not guilty (same sources)\n3. Operating under the influence (OUI): Guilty (this is a separate charge, and the conviction is for OUI, not for manslaughter by vehicle while under the influence)\n\nThe market condition requires guilt for either:\n- Second-degree murder, OR\n- Manslaughter by vehicle while under the influence.\n\nThe verdict shows that she was found not guilty of both second-degree murder and manslaughter (which in the context of the trial is the charge of \"manslaughter while operating a motor vehicle under the influence\"). Therefore, the condition for \"Yes\" is not met.\n\nAdditionally, the market rules state that if the trial ends without a guilty verdict on the specified charges, it resolves to \"No\". The retrial has concluded, and the verdict has been rendered.\n\nWe must also note that the market resolution is based on the initial judgment, and appeals do not matter. The initial judgment in the retrial is the one that counts.\n\nGiven the above, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1).\n\nHowever, we must also consider the timing: the verdict was delivered on June 18, 2025, which is before the deadline of December 31, 2025. Therefore, the outcome is known and meets the conditions for resolution.\n\nLet's check the ancillary data: \n- p1: No (0)\n- p2: Yes (1)\n- p3: unknown/50-50 (0.5)\n\nWe are to return a recommendation: p1, p2, p3, or p4. In this case, we have a clear outcome: the conditions for \"Yes\" are not met, so the resolution is \"No\", which corresponds to p1.\n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p1.\n\nNote: The operating under the influence conviction is a separate charge and does not satisfy the condition for the market, which specifically requires guilt for second-degree murder or manslaughter by vehicle while under the influence.\n\nWe must also note that the market rules state: \"If these charges are both dismissed at any point, this market will resolve to 'No'.\" In this case, the charges were not dismissed, but she was acquitted of them.

The key facts from the search results are:\n\n1. **Verdict Details**: On June 18, 2025, the jury in Karen Read's retrial found her:\n   - **Not guilty** of second-degree murder [8][9][14][17][18][19]\n   - **Not guilty** of manslaughter while operating a motor vehicle under the influence [8][9][14][17][19]\n   - Guilty of operating under the influence of liquor (a lesser charge) [14][17][19]\n\n2. **Trial Conclusion**: The retrial concluded with a final judgment on June 18, 2025, well before the December 31, 2025 deadline specified in the market resolution conditions [5][8][9].\n\n3. **Market Resolution Conditions**:  \n   - The market resolves to \"Yes\" only if Read is found guilty of either:  \n     a) Second-degree murder, OR  \n     b) Manslaughter by vehicle while under the influence.  \n   - The guilty verdict for operating under the influence does not satisfy the resolution conditions for \"Yes\" [6][19].  \n   - Since both specified charges resulted in acquittals, the conditions for \"Yes\" are unmet.  \n\n4. **Ancillary Data Alignment**:  \n   - p1 corresponds to \"No\" (market resolves to \"No\")  \n   - p2 corresponds to \"Yes\"  \n   - p3 corresponds to unknown/50-50  \n\n**Resolution Recommendation**:  \nThe jury's acquittal on both second-degree murder and manslaughter charges means the market resolution condition for \"Yes\" is not met. The operating under the influence conviction is irrelevant to the market's specific criteria. The trial concluded with final judgments on the relevant charges before the December 31, 2025 deadline, and no appeals affect the resolution per market rules.  \n\n**recommendation: p1**",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750308176 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-19 04:42:56 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nWe are given a query about a market resolution regarding Karen Read's trial. The market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Karen Read is found guilty of either second-degree murder or manslaughter by vehicle while under the influence by December 31, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. Otherwise, it resolves to \"No\". The resolution conditions are: p1 for No, p2 for Yes, p3 for unknown/50-50.\n\nWe have multiple search results, including recent ones (as of June 19, 2025) that provide the verdict of the retrial. The retrial concluded on June 18, 2025, with the jury finding Karen Read not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter, but guilty of operating under the influence (OUI). However, note that the OUI conviction is a lesser charge and not the same as manslaughter by vehicle while under the influence.\n\nLet's break down the charges and the verdict:\n\n1. Second-degree murder: Not guilty (as per multiple sources, e.g., [8], [9], [14], [17], [18], [19])\n2. Manslaughter while operating a motor vehicle under the influence: Not guilty (same sources)\n3. Operating under the influence (OUI): Guilty (this is a separate charge, and the conviction is for OUI, not for manslaughter by vehicle while under the influence)\n\nThe market condition requires guilt for either:\n- Second-degree murder, OR\n- Manslaughter by vehicle while under the influence.\n\nThe verdict shows that she was found not guilty of both second-degree murder and manslaughter (which in the context of the trial is the charge of \"manslaughter while operating a motor vehicle under the influence\"). Therefore, the condition for \"Yes\" is not met.\n\nAdditionally, the market rules state that if the trial ends without a guilty verdict on the specified charges, it resolves to \"No\". The retrial has concluded, and the verdict has been rendered.\n\nWe must also note that the market resolution is based on the initial judgment, and appeals do not matter. The initial judgment in the retrial is the one that counts.\n\nGiven the above, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1).\n\nHowever, we must also consider the timing: the verdict was delivered on June 18, 2025, which is before the deadline of December 31, 2025. Therefore, the outcome is known and meets the conditions for resolution.\n\nLet's check the ancillary data: \n- p1: No (0)\n- p2: Yes (1)\n- p3: unknown/50-50 (0.5)\n\nWe are to return a recommendation: p1, p2, p3, or p4. In this case, we have a clear outcome: the conditions for \"Yes\" are not met, so the resolution is \"No\", which corresponds to p1.\n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p1.\n\nNote: The operating under the influence conviction is a separate charge and does not satisfy the condition for the market, which specifically requires guilt for second-degree murder or manslaughter by vehicle while under the influence.\n\nWe must also note that the market rules state: \"If these charges are both dismissed at any point, this market will resolve to 'No'.\" In this case, the charges were not dismissed, but she was acquitted of them. Acquittal is a form of resolution that does not meet the guilty condition, so it resolves to \"No\".\n\nThus, the final recommendation is p1.\n</think>\nBased on the provided search results and the specific resolution conditions for the market query, I have analyzed the outcome of Karen Read's retrial regarding the charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter by vehicle while under the influence. The key facts from the search results are:\n\n1. **Verdict Details**: On June 18, 2025, the jury in Karen Read's retrial found her:\n   - **Not guilty** of second-degree murder [8][9][14][17][18][19]\n   - **Not guilty** of manslaughter while operating a motor vehicle under the influence [8][9][14][17][19]\n   - Guilty of operating under the influence of liquor (a lesser charge) [14][17][19]\n\n2. **Trial Conclusion**: The retrial concluded with a final judgment on June 18, 2025, well before the December 31, 2025 deadline specified in the market resolution conditions [5][8][9].\n\n3. **Market Resolution Conditions**:  \n   - The market resolves to \"Yes\" only if Read is found guilty of either:  \n     a) Second-degree murder, OR  \n     b) Manslaughter by vehicle while under the influence.  \n   - The guilty verdict for operating under the influence does not satisfy the resolution conditions for \"Yes\" [6][19].  \n   - Since both specified charges resulted in acquittals, the conditions for \"Yes\" are unmet.  \n\n4. **Ancillary Data Alignment**:  \n   - p1 corresponds to \"No\" (market resolves to \"No\")  \n   - p2 corresponds to \"Yes\"  \n   - p3 corresponds to unknown/50-50  \n\n**Resolution Recommendation**:  \nThe jury's acquittal on both second-degree murder and manslaughter charges means the market resolution condition for \"Yes\" is not met.

The trial concluded with final judgments on the relevant charges before the December 31, 2025 deadline, and no appeals affect the resolution per market rules.  \n\n**recommendation: p1**\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.002, ID: 115358727403060543386069417748938120794581764339695807042555621112970770993014, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.998, ID: 69428854316791585430793068477141319233045194392011463635725155033993394923388, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (0.998 = 99.8% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.
