Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\"), college football (e.g., \"What was the score of the Alabama game last Saturday?\"), college basketball (e.g., \"What was Duke's score in their last game?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",

Available Data Sources Information:\n   ALL AVAILABLE API CONFIGURATIONS:\n   - Binance (Category: crypto):\n     * API Key: BINANCE_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.binance.com/api/v3\n     * proxy endpoint: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\n   - Sports Data IO - MLB (Category: sports, Subcategory: baseball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb\n   - Sports Data IO - NBA (Category: sports, Subcategory: basketball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NBA_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nba\n   - Sports Data IO - NFL (Category: sports, Subcategory: football):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NFL_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nfl\n   - Sports Data IO - NHL (Category: sports, Subcategory: hockey):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nhl\n   - Sports Data IO - CFB (Category: sports, Subcategory: college football):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_CFB_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/cfb\n   - Sports Data IO - CBB (Category: sports, Subcategory: college basketball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_CBB_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/cbb\n\n5. Query Type Specific Information:\n\n   Cryptocurrency Data Sources:\n   - Binance:\n     * primary: https://api.binance.com/api/v3\n     * proxy: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\n     * RECOMMENDED: Use this proxy endpoint first for better reliability\n     * Example: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy?symbol=BTCUSDT&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime=TIMESTAMP&endTime=TIMESTAMP\n\n     * CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Since a proxy endpoint is provided, you MUST implement a fallback mechanism:\n       1. Try the proxy endpoint first (better reliability)\n       2. If proxy fails (timeout, error response, etc.), automatically fall back to the primary endpoint\n       3. Your code MUST handle this gracefully with try/except blocks\n\n     Example fallback code structure:\n     ```python\n     def get_data(symbol, start_time, end_time):\n         try:\n             # First try the proxy endpoint\n             response = requests.get(f\"{proxy_url}?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n         except Exception as e:\n             print(f\"Proxy endpoint failed: {str(e)}, falling back to primary endpoint\")\n             # Fall back to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n             response = requests.get(f\"{primary_url}/klines?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n     ```\n     \n6. NEVER include actual API key values in the code, always load them from environment variables.\n\n7. IMPORTANT FOR ALL DATA SOURCES: If a proxy endpoint is provided alongside a primary endpoint, you MUST implement the fallback mechanism described above. This is critical for reliability:\n   - Always try the proxy endpoint first\n   - If the proxy fails, fall back to the primary endpoint\n   - Use appropriate timeout values (10 seconds recommended)\n   - Include proper error handling with try/except blocks\n\nThe code should be completely self-contained and runnable with no arguments.\n\n\nHere's a complete code example that shows how to solve this type of problem:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Note: Binance public API doesn't require an API key for basic price queries\n# However, if we need rate limits increased or private endpoints, we would use these:\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\nBINANCE_API_SECRET = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\")\n\n# Sensitive data patterns to mask in logs\nSENSITIVE_PATTERNS = [\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_KEY\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    #

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Bitcoin Up or Down - June 17, 5 AM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for BTC/USDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTC/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTC/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 552281\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750154553 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-17 10:02:33 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# API keys loaded from environment variables\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\n\n# Configure logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nconsole_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\nconsole_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nconsole_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\nlogger.addHandler(console_handler)\n\ndef get_data(symbol, start_time, end_time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches data from Binance API with a fallback to a proxy endpoint if the primary fails.\n    \"\"\"\n    proxy_url = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\"\n    primary_url = \"https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines\"\n\n    try:\n        # First try the proxy endpoint\n        response = requests.get(f\"{proxy_url}?symbol={symbol}&interval=1h&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n        if data:\n            return data[0]\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.warning(f\"Proxy endpoint failed: {str(e)}, falling back to primary endpoint\")\n        # Fall back to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n        try:\n            response = requests.get(f\"{primary_url}?symbol={symbol}&interval=1h&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n            response.raise_for_status()\n            data = response.json()\n            if data:\n                return data[0]\n        except Exception as e:\n            logger.error(f\"Primary endpoint also failed: {str(e)}\")\n            raise\n\ndef resolve_market():\n    \"\"\"\n    Resolves the market based on the price change of BTC/USDT on Binance.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the specific time for the market resolution\n    target_time = datetime(2025, 6, 17, 5, 0, 0, tzinfo=pytz.timezone(\"US/Eastern\"))\n    target_time_utc = target_time.astimezone(pytz.utc)\n    start_time_ms = int(target_time_utc.timestamp() * 1000)\n    end_time_ms = start_time_ms + 3600000  # 1 hour later\n\n    try:\n        data = get_data(\"BTCUSDT\", start_time_ms, end_time_ms)\n        if data:\n            open_price = float(data[1])\n            close_price = float(data[4])\n            change_percentage = ((close_price - open_price) / open_price) * 100\n\n            if change_percentage >= 0:\n                print(\"recommendation: p2\")  # Up\n            else:\n                print(\"recommendation: p1\")  # Down\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Failed to resolve market: {e}\")\n        print(\"recommendation: p3\")  # Unknown/50-50 if error occurs\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    resolve_market()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p2\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful. Recommendation found: p2.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p2\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.0005, ID: 28945698358201078791744212662551089283637881477518722738220158727715492030905, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.9995, ID: 46642648996730593370333552085241121241263330201351676044189929969160208704311, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Query Type Specific Information:\n\n   Cryptocurrency Data Sources:\n   - Binance:\n     * primary: https://api.binance.com/api/v3\n     * proxy: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\n     * RECOMMENDED: Use this proxy endpoint first for better reliability\n     * Example: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy?symbol=BTCUSDT&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime=TIMESTAMP&endTime=TIMESTAMP\n\n     * CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Since a proxy endpoint is provided, you MUST implement a fallback mechanism:\n       1. Try the proxy endpoint first (better reliability)\n       2. If proxy fails (timeout, error response, etc.), automatically fall back to the primary endpoint\n       3. Your code MUST handle this gracefully with try/except blocks\n\n     Example fallback code structure:\n     ```python\n     def get_data(symbol, start_time, end_time):\n         try:\n             # First try the proxy endpoint\n             response = requests.get(f\"{proxy_url}?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n         except Exception as e:\n             print(f\"Proxy endpoint failed: {str(e)}, falling back to primary endpoint\")\n             # Fall back to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n             response = requests.get(f\"{primary_url}/klines?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n     ```\n     \n6. NEVER include actual API key values in the code, always load them from environment variables.\n\n7. IMPORTANT FOR ALL DATA SOURCES: If a proxy endpoint is provided alongside a primary endpoint, you MUST implement the fallback mechanism described above. This is critical for reliability:\n   - Always try the proxy endpoint first\n   - If the proxy fails, fall back to the primary endpoint\n   - Use appropriate timeout values (10 seconds recommended)\n   - Include proper error handling with try/except blocks\n\nThe code should be completely self-contained and runnable with no arguments.\n\n\nHere's a complete code example that shows how to solve this type of problem:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Note: Binance public API doesn't require an API key for basic price queries\n# However, if we need rate limits increased or private endpoints, we would use these:\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\nBINANCE_API_SECRET = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\")\n\n# Sensitive data patterns to mask in logs\nSENSITIVE_PATTERNS = [\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_KEY\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    #

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTC/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTC/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 552281\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750154553 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-17 10:02:33 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p2.

Recommendation found: p1.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p1\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.0005, ID: 28945698358201078791744212662551089283637881477518722738220158727715492030905, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.9995, ID: 46642648996730593370333552085241121241263330201351676044189929969160208704311, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Try the proxy endpoint first (better reliability)\n       2. If proxy fails (timeout, error response, etc.), automatically fall back to the primary endpoint\n       3. Your code MUST handle this gracefully with try/except blocks\n\n     Example fallback code structure:\n     ```python\n     def get_data(symbol, start_time, end_time):\n         try:\n             # First try the proxy endpoint\n             response = requests.get(f\"{proxy_url}?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n         except Exception as e:\n             print(f\"Proxy endpoint failed: {str(e)}, falling back to primary endpoint\")\n             # Fall back to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n             response = requests.get(f\"{primary_url}/klines?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n     ```\n     \n6. NEVER include actual API key values in the code, always load them from environment variables.\n\n7. IMPORTANT FOR ALL DATA SOURCES: If a proxy endpoint is provided alongside a primary endpoint, you MUST implement the fallback mechanism described above. This is critical for reliability:\n   - Always try the proxy endpoint first\n   - If the proxy fails, fall back to the primary endpoint\n   - Use appropriate timeout values (10 seconds recommended)\n   - Include proper error handling with try/except blocks\n\nThe code should be completely self-contained and runnable with no arguments.\n\n\nHere's a complete code example that shows how to solve this type of problem:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Note: Binance public API doesn't require an API key for basic price queries\n# However, if we need rate limits increased or private endpoints, we would use these:\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\nBINANCE_API_SECRET = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\")\n\n# Sensitive data patterns to mask in logs\nSENSITIVE_PATTERNS = [\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_KEY\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    #

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Bitcoin Up or Down - June 17, 5 AM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for BTC/USDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTC/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTC/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 552281\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750154553 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-17 10:02:33 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p2. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Consider verifying the data source or methodology used in determining the price change, as the strong market sentiment suggests a potential issue with the solver's data interpretation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# API keys loaded from environment variables\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\n\n# API endpoints\nPRIMARY_API_URL = \"https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines\"\nPROXY_API_URL = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\"\n\ndef fetch_binance_data(symbol, interval, start_time, end_time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches data from Binance API with a fallback to a proxy server if the primary request fails.\n    \"\"\"\n    params = {\n        \"symbol\": symbol,\n        \"interval\": interval,\n        \"limit\": 1,\n        \"startTime\": start_time,\n        \"endTime\": end_time\n    }\n    try:\n        # Try fetching data from the proxy endpoint first\n        response = requests.get(PROXY_API_URL, params=params, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n        if data:\n            return data\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Proxy endpoint failed: {str(e)}, falling back to primary endpoint\")\n        # Fall back to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n        try:\n            response = requests.get(PRIMARY_API_URL, params=params, timeout=10)\n            response.raise_for_status()\n            return response.json()\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"Primary endpoint also failed: {str(e)}\")\n            return None\n\ndef get_price_change(symbol, target_datetime):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the price change percentage for the specified symbol at the given datetime.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert datetime to milliseconds since epoch\n    start_time = int(target_datetime.timestamp() * 1000)\n    end_time = start_time + 3600000  # 1 hour later\n\n    # Fetch data\n    data = fetch_binance_data(symbol, \"1h\", start_time, end_time)\n    if data and len(data) > 0:\n        open_price = float(data[0][1])\n        close_price = float(data[0][4])\n        price_change_percent = ((close_price - open_price) / open_price) * 100\n        return price_change_percent\n    else:\n        return None\n\ndef main():\n    # Define the target datetime for the event\n    target_datetime_str = \"2025-06-17 05:00:00\"\n    timezone_str = \"US/Eastern\"\n    symbol = \"BTCUSDT\"\n\n    # Convert string to datetime object in the specified timezone\n    tz = pytz.timezone(timezone_str)\n    target_datetime = datetime.strptime(target_datetime_str, \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n    target_datetime = tz.localize(target_datetime)\n\n    # Get the price change percentage\n    price_change_percent = get_price_change(symbol, target_datetime)\n\n    # Determine the resolution based on the price change\n    if price_change_percent is not None:\n        if price_change_percent >= 0:\n            print(\"recommendation: p2\")  # Up\n        else:\n            print(\"recommendation: p1\")  # Down\n    else:\n        print(\"recommendation: p3\")  # Unknown/50-50 due to data fetch failure\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p1\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful. Recommendation found: p1.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p1\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.0005, ID: 28945698358201078791744212662551089283637881477518722738220158727715492030905, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.9995, ID: 46642648996730593370333552085241121241263330201351676044189929969160208704311, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on whether the BTC/USDT 1-hour candle starting at June 17, 5 AM ET (which is 9 AM UTC) had a percentage change greater than or equal to 0. The resolution source is Binance's BTC/USDT pair, specifically the change value displayed for that 1H candle.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current time. The current timestamp given is 1750154553, which translates to June 17, 2025, 10:02:33 UTC. The candle in question starts at 9 AM UTC and ends at 10 AM UTC. Since the current time is 10:02 UTC, the candle has just closed, so the data should be available.\n\nLooking at the search results, result 6 from Binance Square Post on April 23, 2025, shows a 1H analysis with a 24-hour change of +3.97%, but that's from April. Not relevant here. Result 15 is a technical analysis from May 17, 2025, which is also not the current date. Result 16 from Kitco shows the Bitcoin price at $107,211.72 as of June 17, 2025, 1:34 AM NY Time (which is 5:34 UTC), but that's earlier in the day. The 1H candle from 9-10 AM UTC would be after that.\n\nResult 7 from TradingView mentions the BTCUSDT Futures Contract for June 2025, with the current price at 106,988.9 USDT as of the timestamp, but that's futures data, not the spot market. The user specified the resolution source is the BTC/USDT pair on Binance, so futures data might not be applicable here unless the spot and futures prices are closely aligned, but the user's ancillary data specifies the spot market.\n\nResult 16's crypto market data from Kitco as of 1:34 AM NY Time (5:34 UTC) shows Bitcoin at $107,211.72. However, the candle in question is from 9-10 AM UTC, which is later. Since the current time is 10:02 UTC, the latest data should be available. \n\nResult 5 from Kaggle has a dataset with 4-hour data up to January 2025, but the relevant time is June 17, 2025, which is within the dataset's range. However, it's 4-hour data, not 1-hour, so not directly useful. \n\nResult 6's analysis from April 2025 isn't relevant. Result 15's May 17 analysis is also not current. \n\nSince the search results don't provide the exact 1H candle data for June 17, 9-10 AM UTC, I might need to infer based on available data. However, the user's personalization instructions say that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. But since the event just occurred (current time is 10:02 UTC, candle closed at 10:00 UTC), the data should be available.\n\nWait, the search results might not have the latest data. The ancillary data says to use the change value displayed at the top of the Binance graph for the 1H candle. Since we can't access live data, but the current time is past the candle's close, we need to check if any search results include this specific data.\n\nLooking at result 16 again, the Kitco data as of 1:34 AM NY Time (5:34 UTC) shows Bitcoin at $107,211.72 with a 24h change of +0.53%. But the 1H change for the specific candle isn't listed. The 1h% column shows -0.25% for Bitcoin, but that's as of 1:34 AM NY Time, which is 5:34 UTC, not the 9-10 AM UTC window.\n\nResult 7's TradingView data for the futures contract shows a price of 106,988.9 USDT, up 1.40% in 24h, but again, this is futures and not the spot market.\n\nSince the search results don't provide the exact 1H change for the specified time, but the event date is in the past (June 17, 2025), and the current time is after the candle's close, I need to proceed. According to the user's instructions, if no verifiable information is available but the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. However, the user also mentioned that if the event is in the past and no info is available, default to p4. But wait, the personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nIn this case, the event date is in the past (June 17, 5 AM ET which is 9 AM UTC), and the current time is 10:02 UTC, so the candle has closed. However, the provided search results don't include the specific 1H candle data for that time. The latest price in the search results is from result 16, which is as of 1:34 AM NY Time (5:34 UTC), showing Bitcoin at $107,211.72. The 1h% change there is -0.25%, but that's for a different time window.\n\nSince we can't access the exact data from Binance for the 9-10 AM UTC candle, but the user's instructions say to use Binance's data, and if unavailable, assume the most probable outcome. However, without the data, we can't verify. Therefore, according to the instructions, if no verifiable information is available, we should default to p4 (unknown/50-50). But wait, the user's ancillary data says p3 corresponds to 0.5 (unknown/50-50). Wait, the resolution_conditions are p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: 0.5. So if we can't determine, we should recommend p3.\n\nBut the personalization also says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" However, without any sources contradicting, but also no sources confirming, it's unclear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the latest price in the search results can help. Result 16's Bitcoin price at 5:34 UTC is $107,211.72. If we assume that between 9-10 AM UTC, the price movement was positive, but without data, it's speculative. However, the user's instructions emphasize relying strictly on verified facts. Since none of the provided search results include the specific 1H candle data for 9-10 AM UTC on June 17, 2025, and we can't access live data, we have to conclude that there's no verifiable information available. Therefore, according to the instructions, we should resolve to p3 (unknown/50-50). \n\nBut wait, the user's personalization also states: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\" The user provided the Binance URL (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT) as the resolution source. However, the search results don't include a direct scrape of that URL at the relevant time. The provided search results don't have the exact data needed. \n\nIn this case, since the data isn't available in the provided search results, and we can't access the live URL, we have to default to p3. However, the current time is after the event, so the data should be available. But given the search results don't include it, perhaps the answer is p4? Wait, the personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4.\" But the event has occurred (current time is after the event). However, if the data isn't available in the provided sources, we can't verify, so according to the instructions, if no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome. But without any data, how can we assume? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Kaggle dataset in result 5 includes the 4-hour data up to January 2025, but the event is in June 2025, which is outside that range. Result 5's dataset ends in January 2025. So that's not helpful. \n\nResult 7's TradingView data for the futures contract as of the current time shows a price of 106,988.9 USDT, up 1.40% in 24h. But this is futures, not spot. The user specified the spot market. \n\nGiven all this, since the necessary data isn't present in the search results, and we can't access the live URL, we have to conclude that there's no verifiable information available. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, we should resolve to p3 (unknown/50-50). However, the resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5, which corresponds to unknown. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. But without any data, we can't determine the most probable outcome. Therefore, the correct resolution is p3.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750154553 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-17 10:02:33 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on whether the BTC/USDT 1-hour candle starting at June 17, 5 AM ET (which is 9 AM UTC) had a percentage change greater than or equal to 0. The resolution source is Binance's BTC/USDT pair, specifically the change value displayed for that 1H candle.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current time. The current timestamp given is 1750154553, which translates to June 17, 2025, 10:02:33 UTC. The candle in question starts at 9 AM UTC and ends at 10 AM UTC. Since the current time is 10:02 UTC, the candle has just closed, so the data should be available.\n\nLooking at the search results, result 6 from Binance Square Post on April 23, 2025, shows a 1H analysis with a 24-hour change of +3.97%, but that's from April. Not relevant here. Result 15 is a technical analysis from May 17, 2025, which is also not the current date. Result 16 from Kitco shows the Bitcoin price at $107,211.72 as of June 17, 2025, 1:34 AM NY Time (which is 5:34 UTC), but that's earlier in the day. The 1H candle from 9-10 AM UTC would be after that.\n\nResult 7 from TradingView mentions the BTCUSDT Futures Contract for June 2025, with the current price at 106,988.9 USDT as of the timestamp, but that's futures data, not the spot market. The user specified the resolution source is the BTC/USDT pair on Binance, so futures data might not be applicable here unless the spot and futures prices are closely aligned, but the user's ancillary data specifies the spot market.\n\nResult 16's crypto market data from Kitco as of 1:34 AM NY Time (5:34 UTC) shows Bitcoin at $107,211.72. However, the candle in question is from 9-10 AM UTC, which is later. Since the current time is 10:02 UTC, the latest data should be available. \n\nResult 5 from Kaggle has a dataset with 4-hour data up to January 2025, but the relevant time is June 17, 2025, which is within the dataset's range. However, it's 4-hour data, not 1-hour, so not directly useful. \n\nResult 6's analysis from April 2025 isn't relevant. Result 15's May 17 analysis is also not current. \n\nSince the search results don't provide the exact 1H candle data for June 17, 9-10 AM UTC, I might need to infer based on available data. However, the user's personalization instructions say that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. But since the event just occurred (current time is 10:02 UTC, candle closed at 10:00 UTC), the data should be available.\n\nWait, the search results might not have the latest data. The ancillary data says to use the change value displayed at the top of the Binance graph for the 1H candle. Since we can't access live data, but the current time is past the candle's close, we need to check if any search results include this specific data.\n\nLooking at result 16 again, the Kitco data as of 1:34 AM NY Time (5:34 UTC) shows Bitcoin at $107,211.72 with a 24h change of +0.53%. But the 1H change for the specific candle isn't listed. The 1h% column shows -0.25% for Bitcoin, but that's as of 1:34 AM NY Time, which is 5:34 UTC, not the 9-10 AM UTC window.\n\nResult 7's TradingView data for the futures contract shows a price of 106,988.9 USDT, up 1.40% in 24h, but again, this is futures and not the spot market.\n\nSince the search results don't provide the exact 1H change for the specified time, but the event date is in the past (June 17, 2025), and the current time is after the candle's close, I need to proceed. According to the user's instructions, if no verifiable information is available but the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this again. The user is asking about the Bitcoin Up or Down market for June 17, 5 AM ET. The resolution depends on the 1-hour BTC/USDT candle on Binance. The previous response was p3, but they want me to check again.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the exact time of the candle. The event time is June 17, 5 AM ET. Since the current time is June 17, 10:06 AM UTC, I should convert 5 AM ET to UTC. ET is either UTC-4 or UTC-5 depending on daylight saving. Let me check: in June, Eastern Time is UTC-4. So 5 AM ET would be 9 AM UTC. The 1-hour candle starts at 9 AM UTC and ends at 10 AM UTC. The current time is 10:06 AM UTC, which is after the candle closed. So the data should be available now.\n\nThe resolution source is Binance's BTC/USDT pair. I need to look at the 1H candle starting at 5 AM ET (9 AM UTC) and check the percentage change. The change is displayed at the top of the graph for that specific candle. If the change is >=0%, it's p2 (Up); otherwise, p1 (Down).\n\nSince the candle closed at 10 AM UTC, and it's now 10:06 AM, the data should be finalized. I need to access Binance's historical data for that exact time. However, I can't directly access live data or APIs. The user might expect me to infer based on available information or any provided URLs, but there are no URLs given here. \n\nWait, the user mentioned the resolution source is Binance's BTC/USDT pair link. But without real-time access, I can't check the current percentage. However, the current timestamp is June 17, 2025, which is a future date relative to my knowledge cutoff in July 2024. So I don't have actual data past that point. But the user provided a current date of June 17, 2025, as part of the scenario. \n\nSince this is a hypothetical situation, I need to follow the instructions. If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp provided (2025-06-17 10:02:33 UTC), and no verifiable info is available, I should assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But the user's additional instructions say if the event is in the past and no info is available, and it's not postponed, resolve based on probable outcome. \n\nBut wait, the candle's time is 9-10 AM UTC, and the current time is 10:06 AM UTC, so the candle has closed. If there's no data available, perhaps due to API issues, but the market conditions say to use the change value from Binance. Since I can't access the data, but the event time has passed, maybe the system expects me to default to p3 (unknown) if data isn't available. However, the user's previous response was p3, and they want a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the most probable outcome can be inferred. If the user wants a different approach, perhaps considering that without data, but the event time has passed, the market should resolve to p4? Wait, no. The instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions unless contradicted. But how to determine probable outcome without data? \n\nWait, the resolution conditions are p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: 0.5. The user's previous response was p3, but maybe there's a way to infer. If the price movement is unknown, but the market requires a binary outcome, perhaps p3 is correct. However, the user is asking to try again. Maybe the correct approach is to check alternative data sources, but without access, perhaps the answer remains p3. Alternatively, if the event time has passed and no data is available, maybe it's considered invalid and p3 is appropriate. \n\nBut the user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. If we can't determine, then p3. Since I can't access Binance's data, and the user hasn't provided any URLs or specific data points, I have to stick with p3. However, the user is telling me to check alternative data sources. Maybe I should consider that the price change is 0.5, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, the resolution conditions have p3 as 0.5, which corresponds to unknown/50-50. \n\nGiven that the candle has closed, but no data is accessible, the correct resolution would be p3. But the user says the previous response was p3 and to try again. Maybe there's an error in the previous reasoning. Alternatively, perhaps the answer should be p4, but according to the instructions, p4 is only if the event is in the future. Since the event is in the past, and no data is available, it's p3. \n\nWait, the initial problem might be that the user's current time is June 17, 10:06 AM UTC, and the candle closed at 10 AM UTC. So the data should be available. If the system can't access it, but the user expects a resolution, maybe the answer is p3. However, the user wants a different approach. Maybe in the absence of data, the default is p3. Therefore, the recommendation remains p3.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750154553 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-17 10:02:33 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p3. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this again. The user is asking about the Bitcoin Up or Down market for June 17, 5 AM ET. The resolution depends on the 1-hour BTC/USDT candle on Binance. The previous response was p3, but they want me to check again.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the exact time of the candle. The event time is June 17, 5 AM ET. Since the current time is June 17, 10:06 AM UTC, I should convert 5 AM ET to UTC. ET is either UTC-4 or UTC-5 depending on daylight saving. Let me check: in June, Eastern Time is UTC-4. So 5 AM ET would be 9 AM UTC. The 1-hour candle starts at 9 AM UTC and ends at 10 AM UTC. The current time is 10:06 AM UTC, which is after the candle closed. So the data should be available now.\n\nThe resolution source is Binance's BTC/USDT pair. I need to look at the 1H candle starting at 5 AM ET (9 AM UTC) and check the percentage change. The change is displayed at the top of the graph for that specific candle. If the change is >=0%, it's p2 (Up); otherwise, p1 (Down).\n\nSince the candle closed at 10 AM UTC, and it's now 10:06 AM, the data should be finalized. I need to access Binance's historical data for that exact time. However, I can't directly access live data or APIs. The user might expect me to infer based on available information or any provided URLs, but there are no URLs given here. \n\nWait, the user mentioned the resolution source is Binance's BTC/USDT pair link. But without real-time access, I can't check the current percentage. However, the current timestamp is June 17, 2025, which is a future date relative to my knowledge cutoff in July 2024. So I don't have actual data past that point. But the user provided a current date of June 17, 2025, as part of the scenario. \n\nSince this is a hypothetical situation, I need to follow the instructions. If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp provided (2025-06-17 10:02:33 UTC), and no verifiable info is available, I should assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But the user's additional instructions say if the event is in the past and no info is available, and it's not postponed, resolve based on probable outcome. \n\nBut wait, the candle's time is 9-10 AM UTC, and the current time is 10:06 AM UTC, so the candle has closed. If there's no data available, perhaps due to API issues, but the market conditions say to use the change value from Binance. Since I can't access the data, but the event time has passed, maybe the system expects me to default to p3 (unknown) if data isn't available. However, the user's previous response was p3, and they want a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the most probable outcome can be inferred. If the user wants a different approach, perhaps considering that without data, but the event time has passed, the market should resolve to p4? Wait, no. The instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions unless contradicted. But how to determine probable outcome without data? \n\nWait, the resolution conditions are p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: 0.5. The user's previous response was p3, but maybe there's a way to infer. If the price movement is unknown, but the market requires a binary outcome, perhaps p3 is correct. However, the user is asking to try again. Maybe the correct approach is to check alternative data sources, but without access, perhaps the answer remains p3. Alternatively, if the event time has passed and no data is available, maybe it's considered invalid and p3 is appropriate. \n\nBut the user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. If we can't determine, then p3. Since I can't access Binance's data, and the user hasn't provided any URLs or specific data points, I have to stick with p3. However, the user is telling me to check alternative data sources. Maybe I should consider that the price change is 0.5, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, the resolution conditions have p3 as 0.5, which corresponds to unknown/50-50. \n\nGiven that the candle has closed, but no data is accessible, the correct resolution would be p3. But the user says the previous response was p3 and to try again. Maybe there's an error in the previous reasoning. Alternatively, perhaps the answer should be p4, but according to the instructions, p4 is only if the event is in the future. Since the event is in the past, and no data is available, it's p3. \n\nWait, the initial problem might be that the user's current time is June 17, 10:06 AM UTC, and the candle closed at 10 AM UTC. So the data should be available. If the system can't access it, but the user expects a resolution, maybe the answer is p3. However, the user wants a different approach. Maybe in the absence of data, the default is p3. Therefore, the recommendation remains p3.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.0005, ID: 28945698358201078791744212662551089283637881477518722738220158727715492030905, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.9995, ID: 46642648996730593370333552085241121241263330201351676044189929969160208704311, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on whether the BTC/USDT 1-hour candle starting June 17 at 5 AM ET (which is 9 AM UTC) had a percentage change greater than or equal to 0. The resolution source is Binance's BTC/USDT pair, specifically the change value displayed for that 1H candle.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the exact time of the candle. The title says June 17, 5 AM ET. Converting that to UTC, since ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, 5 AM ET would be 9 AM UTC. The 1-hour candle from 9:00 to 10:00 UTC on June 17, 2025.\n\nNext, I check the provided search results for any data matching this timeframe. Looking through the sources, several mention BTC/USDT prices around June 16-17, 2025. For example, source [12] from Blockchain.news on June 16 mentions BTC testing $108K-$109K with a 15% increase in trading volume. Source [15] from June 17 notes a high of $67,800 at 10:30 UTC but a pullback to $67,250 by 12:00 UTC. However, these might be from different days or not the exact 9-10 AM window.\n\nSource [53] from CoinMarketCap shows the BTC/USDT rate on June 17 as 106,701 USDT, with a 0.39% decrease in the last 24 hours. But this is a 24-hour change, not the specific 1-hour window. Similarly, source [25] from TradingView on June 17 lists the current price but doesn't specify the exact hour.\n\nSource [30] from Coinalyze.net provides a live price chart with trades on June 17 around 06:22 UTC, but the relevant 9-10 AM data isn't present. Source [12] again mentions a spike in trading volume at 13:00 UTC on June 16, which is a different day.\n\nThe key is to find the 1-hour candle's percentage change at 9 AM UTC on June 17. None of the provided sources explicitly state the change for that exact hour. However, source [15] from Blockchain.news on June 17 mentions a high of $67,800 at 10:30 UTC and a pullback, but this is after the 9-10 AM window. Without direct data for that hour, I might need to infer based on nearby data or check if any sources have the specific 1H change.\n\nWait, source [53] (CoinMarketCap) has a table showing the BTC/USDT rate on June 17 as 106,701 with a 0.39% 24h decrease. But the 1H change isn't specified. The user's resolution condition relies on the 1H candle's change from Binance. Since the provided search results don't have the exact 9-10 AM UTC data, but the current time in the system is June 17, 10:02:33 UTC, the candle would have just closed at 10:00 UTC. However, the data might not be immediately available in the sources yet.\n\nGiven that the current timestamp is 10:02 UTC, the 9-10 AM candle just closed. The user's previous attempt returned p3, so I need to check again. If Binance's API or page (source [33]) is the resolution source, but the data isn't present in the provided search results, I might have to assume that the change is not available yet or infer from nearby data. However, the ancillary data says to resolve based on Binance's displayed change for that candle. If the data isn't available in the provided context, the recommendation would be p3 again. But the user wants a different approach. Maybe check if any sources have the 1H data. Source [26] is a Kaggle dataset with 4-hour data up to January 2025, which doesn't help. Source [12] from June 16 mentions a 15% volume increase but not the specific hour. Source [15] from June 17 mentions a high at 10:30 UTC, which is after the candle. Without explicit data, the recommendation would be p3. However, the user's personalization says to consider the market conditions. If the event date is in the past (June 17, 5 AM ET is June 17, 9 AM UTC, which is before the current time of 10:02 UTC), and no data is available, the instruction says to assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. If the candle's data isn't found, perhaps the price at 9 AM was lower than at 10 AM, leading to a positive change. Alternatively, if the price decreased during that hour, it would be negative. Without data, but given the current price is 106,701 (from source [53]) and the previous close was 106,746.81 on June 16, maybe the 1H change was negative. However, this is speculative. Since the exact data isn't present, and the user's previous attempt was p3, but they want a different approach, perhaps the correct answer is p4 (cannot resolve), but the options are p1, p2, p3. Wait, the ancillary data says p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: 50-50. If the data isn't available, the recommendation is p3. But the user says to try again. Maybe I missed a source. Let me check again. Source [15] from June 17 mentions the BTC/USDT pair on Binance saw a high of $67,800 at 10:30 UTC, but that's after the 9-10 AM window. The candle in question is 9-10 AM. If the price at 9 AM was lower than at 10 AM, the change is positive. If the price dropped, it's negative. Without explicit data, but given the current time is just after 10 AM, and the data might not be available yet, the resolution would be p3. However, the user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no data, assume the most probable outcome. If the market is about whether the change is >=0, and if the price at 10 AM is higher than at 9 AM, it's Up. If the price data isn't available, but considering the overall trend, maybe it's up. Alternatively, looking at the 24h data from source [53], which shows a 0.39% decrease, but that's over 24h. The 1H candle could be different. Since the user wants a different approach, perhaps checking the Binance API directly via the provided sources. Source [6] explains how to download klines from Binance using Python, which includes the 1h interval. Source [38] shows code for fetching historical klines. If the data isn't in the provided search results, but the system can execute code, maybe it's possible. However, the user's context doesn't include code execution results. Given the constraints, and the provided sources not having the exact 1H change, the safest recommendation is p3. But the user wants to avoid p3. Alternatively, maybe the change was positive. For example, source [12] mentions BTC testing $108K on June 16, and source [15] on June 17 mentions a high of $67,800 (though this might be a typo, as BTC is over $100k in other sources). There's inconsistency, but assuming the 1H candle had a positive change, the answer would be p2. However, without concrete data, this is a guess. Given the instructions to resolve based on Binance's data and if unavailable, assume the most probable outcome. If the event time has passed and no data, perhaps the default is p3. But the user's previous attempt was p3, so they want a different approach. Maybe the answer is p2, assuming the price increased. Alternatively, check the current price at 10:02 UTC. If the price is higher than the open at 9 AM, it's up. But without the open price, can't calculate. Given the ambiguity, the recommendation remains p3.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750154553 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-17 10:02:33 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p3. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p3. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on whether the BTC/USDT 1-hour candle starting June 17 at 5 AM ET (which is 9 AM UTC) had a percentage change greater than or equal to 0. The resolution source is Binance's BTC/USDT pair, specifically the change value displayed for that 1H candle.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the exact time of the candle. The title says June 17, 5 AM ET. Converting that to UTC, since ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, 5 AM ET would be 9 AM UTC. The 1-hour candle from 9:00 to 10:00 UTC on June 17, 2025.\n\nNext, I check the provided search results for any data matching this timeframe. Looking through the sources, several mention BTC/USDT prices around June 16-17, 2025. For example, source [12] from Blockchain.news on June 16 mentions BTC testing $108K-$109K with a 15% increase in trading volume. Source [15] from June 17 notes a high of $67,800 at 10:30 UTC but a pullback to $67,250 by 12:00 UTC. However, these might be from different days or not the exact 9-10 AM window.\n\nSource [53] from CoinMarketCap shows the BTC/USDT rate on June 17 as 106,701 USDT, with a 0.39% decrease in the last 24 hours. But this is a 24-hour change, not the specific 1-hour window. Similarly, source [25] from TradingView on June 17 lists the current price but doesn't specify the exact hour.\n\nSource [30] from Coinalyze.net provides a live price chart with trades on June 17 around 06:22 UTC, but the relevant 9-10 AM data isn't present. Source [12] again mentions a spike in trading volume at 13:00 UTC on June 16, which is a different day.\n\nThe key is to find the 1-hour candle's percentage change at 9 AM UTC on June 17. None of the provided sources explicitly state the change for that exact hour. However, source [15] from Blockchain.news on June 17 mentions a high of $67,800 at 10:30 UTC and a pullback, but this is after the 9-10 AM window. Without direct data for that hour, I might need to infer based on nearby data or check if any sources have the specific 1H change.\n\nWait, source [53] (CoinMarketCap) has a table showing the BTC/USDT rate on June 17 as 106,701 with a 0.39% 24h decrease. But the 1H change isn't specified. The user's resolution condition relies on the 1H candle's change from Binance. Since the provided search results don't have the exact 9-10 AM UTC data, but the current time in the system is June 17, 10:02:33 UTC, the candle would have just closed at 10:00 UTC. However, the data might not be immediately available in the sources yet.\n\nGiven that the current timestamp is 10:02 UTC, the 9-10 AM candle just closed. The user's previous attempt returned p3, so I need to check again. If Binance's API or page (source [33]) is the resolution source, but the data isn't present in the provided search results, I might have to assume that the change is not available yet or infer from nearby data. However, the ancillary data says to resolve based on Binance's displayed change for that candle. If the data isn't available in the provided context, the recommendation would be p3 again. But the user wants a different approach. Maybe check if any sources have the 1H data. Source [26] is a Kaggle dataset with 4-hour data up to January 2025, which doesn't help. Source [12] from June 16 mentions a 15% volume increase but not the specific hour. Source [15] from June 17 mentions a high at 10:30 UTC, which is after the candle. Without explicit data, the recommendation would be p3. However, the user's personalization says to consider the market conditions. If the event date is in the past (June 17, 5 AM ET is June 17, 9 AM UTC, which is before the current time of 10:02 UTC), and no data is available, the instruction says to assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. If the candle's data isn't found, perhaps the price at 9 AM was lower than at 10 AM, leading to a positive change. Alternatively, if the price decreased during that hour, it would be negative. Without data, but given the current price is 106,701 (from source [53]) and the previous close was 106,746.81 on June 16, maybe the 1H change was negative. However, this is speculative. Since the exact data isn't present, and the user's previous attempt was p3, but they want a different approach, perhaps the correct answer is p4 (cannot resolve), but the options are p1, p2, p3. Wait, the ancillary data says p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: 50-50. If the data isn't available, the recommendation is p3. But the user says to try again. Maybe I missed a source. Let me check again. Source [15] from June 17 mentions the BTC/USDT pair on Binance saw a high of $67,800 at 10:30 UTC, but that's after the 9-10 AM window. The candle in question is 9-10 AM. If the price at 9 AM was lower than at 10 AM, the change is positive. If the price dropped, it's negative. Without explicit data, but given the current time is just after 10 AM, and the data might not be available yet, the resolution would be p3. However, the user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no data, assume the most probable outcome. If the market is about whether the change is >=0, and if the price at 10 AM is higher than at 9 AM, it's Up. If the price data isn't available, but considering the overall trend, maybe it's up. Alternatively, looking at the 24h data from source [53], which shows a 0.39% decrease, but that's over 24h. The 1H candle could be different. Since the user wants a different approach, perhaps checking the Binance API directly via the provided sources. Source [6] explains how to download klines from Binance using Python, which includes the 1h interval. Source [38] shows code for fetching historical klines. If the data isn't in the provided search results, but the system can execute code, maybe it's possible. However, the user's context doesn't include code execution results. Given the constraints, and the provided sources not having the exact 1H change, the safest recommendation is p3. But the user wants to avoid p3. Alternatively, maybe the change was positive. For example, source [12] mentions BTC testing $108K on June 16, and source [15] on June 17 mentions a high of $67,800 (though this might be a typo, as BTC is over $100k in other sources). There's inconsistency, but assuming the 1H candle had a positive change, the answer would be p2. However, without concrete data, this is a guess. Given the instructions to resolve based on Binance's data and if unavailable, assume the most probable outcome. If the event time has passed and no data, perhaps the default is p3. But the user's previous attempt was p3, so they want a different approach. Maybe the answer is p2, assuming the price increased. Alternatively, check the current price at 10:02 UTC. If the price is higher than the open at 9 AM, it's up. But without the open price, can't calculate. Given the ambiguity, the recommendation remains p3.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.0005, ID: 28945698358201078791744212662551089283637881477518722738220158727715492030905, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.9995, ID: 46642648996730593370333552085241121241263330201351676044189929969160208704311, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
