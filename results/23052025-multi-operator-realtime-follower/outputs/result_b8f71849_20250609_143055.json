The resolution depends on the video of the event. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mentions of AI in his speech. The search results [1] to [17] detail his speech topics: freedom, decentralization, unity. Some sources mention his adaptation to new tech post-prison, like AI, but was that during the speech?\n\nLooking at [16], Ulbricht talked about encountering AI after release, but that's his personal experience, not part of the speech.

The user wants to know if Ross Ulbricht said \"A.I\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" during his Bitcoin 2025 speech on May 29. The resolution depends on the video of the event. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mentions of AI in his speech. The search results [1] to [17] detail his speech topics: freedom, decentralization, unity. Some sources mention his adaptation to new tech post-prison, like AI, but was that during the speech?\n\nLooking at [16], Ulbricht talked about encountering AI after release, but that's his personal experience, not part of the speech. [12] is from 2024 and about a tweet, not the 2025 event. [13] and [15] discuss his speech themes but don't mention AI. [16] again mentions he noted AI as part of new tech but not during the speech itself. \n\nThe key sources [1], [3], [4], [5], [14], [15] all focus on freedom, decentralization, unity. No mention of AI in the speech content. The user's ancillary data specifies that any mention in the scheduled speech counts. Since none of the sources indicate he used \"A.I\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" during the Bitcoin 2025 talk, the answer should be \"No\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 1, ID: 5144284784352710313219882103217470727387659365947991067194366473499657970017, Winner: Yes\n- Token: No, Price: 0, ID: 21278350371715882538264069371995938438122612511851224360026067902244325234415, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check all the provided search results for mentions of AI in his speech. Let's go through each source.\n\nLooking at result [2], the article mentions Ulbricht's speech focused on freedom and decentralization but doesn't mention AI. Result [3] is a YouTube video titled with his speech, but the description doesn't include AI. Result [5] from Cointelegraph says the conference's theme was freedom, but again, no mention of AI in his speech there. \n\nResult [9] from TradingView quotes Ulbricht talking about principles like freedom and unity, but no AI. Result [10] from The Block mentions his speech on freedom, decentralization, unity, but no AI. Result [11] from Blockworks also discusses his three principles without AI. \n\nResult [12] from Bitdegree states that Ulbricht was surprised by new tech like AI after prison, but this is in his personal experience, not during the speech. Result [13] from Aicoin.com explicitly says he mentioned never having used AI before his release, but this is part of his personal story, not the speech content. Result [14] from Coindesk details his wasp story and principles, no AI. Result [15] from Cryptotimes.io also mentions his surprise at AI post-release, but again, not in the speech.\n\nWait, result [13] says: \u201cWhen I walked out of prison a few months ago, I'd never seen a drone, used AI, or tried VR. I hadn't even chatted with AI,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it's all hitting me at once \u2014 the freedom, the technology, the fact that I have a future again.\u201d This is from his speech at the conference. So he did mention \"AI\" during his speech. \n\nBut the user's query specifies that any usage of the term counts, regardless of context. Even if he's talking about his personal experience, the mention of \"AI\" in his speech would trigger a \"Yes\" resolution. \n\nHowever, I need to confirm if this was during the scheduled speech on May 29. The sources [12], [13], and [15] all reference his speech at Bitcoin 2025 where he mentioned AI in the context of his post-prison experiences. Since the market resolution is based on the event's video, and these sources report his speech included the term \"AI\", the answer should be \"Yes\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749479258 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-09 14:27:38 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Reevaluate the event content with additional sources or different analytical perspectives to address the discrepancy between the solver's findings and market sentiment.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Ross Ulbricht mentioned \"A.I\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" during his speech at Bitcoin 2025 on May 29. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check all the provided search results for mentions of AI in his speech. Let's go through each source.\n\nLooking at result [2], the article mentions Ulbricht's speech focused on freedom and decentralization but doesn't mention AI. Result [3] is a YouTube video titled with his speech, but the description doesn't include AI. Result [5] from Cointelegraph says the conference's theme was freedom, but again, no mention of AI in his speech there. \n\nResult [9] from TradingView quotes Ulbricht talking about principles like freedom and unity, but no AI. Result [10] from The Block mentions his speech on freedom, decentralization, unity, but no AI. Result [11] from Blockworks also discusses his three principles without AI. \n\nResult [12] from Bitdegree states that Ulbricht was surprised by new tech like AI after prison, but this is in his personal experience, not during the speech. Result [13] from Aicoin.com explicitly says he mentioned never having used AI before his release, but this is part of his personal story, not the speech content. Result [14] from Coindesk details his wasp story and principles, no AI. Result [15] from Cryptotimes.io also mentions his surprise at AI post-release, but again, not in the speech.\n\nWait, result [13] says: \u201cWhen I walked out of prison a few months ago, I'd never seen a drone, used AI, or tried VR. I hadn't even chatted with AI,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it's all hitting me at once \u2014 the freedom, the technology, the fact that I have a future again.\u201d This is from his speech at the conference. So he did mention \"AI\" during his speech. \n\nBut the user's query specifies that any usage of the term counts, regardless of context. Even if he's talking about his personal experience, the mention of \"AI\" in his speech would trigger a \"Yes\" resolution. \n\nHowever, I need to confirm if this was during the scheduled speech on May 29. The sources [12], [13], and [15] all reference his speech at Bitcoin 2025 where he mentioned AI in the context of his post-prison experiences. Since the market resolution is based on the event's video, and these sources report his speech included the term \"AI\", the answer should be \"Yes\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 1, ID: 5144284784352710313219882103217470727387659365947991067194366473499657970017, Winner: Yes\n- Token: No, Price: 0, ID: 21278350371715882538264069371995938438122612511851224360026067902244325234415, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
