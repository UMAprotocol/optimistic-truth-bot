      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking about the resolution of a UFC Fight Night market between Alonzo Menifield and Oumar Sy. The event took place on June 14, 2025, which is the current date according to the timestamp provided. The ancillary data specifies that if Menifield wins, the market resolves to \"Sy\" (p1), if Sy wins, it resolves to \"Buckley\" (p2), and if it's a draw or postponed/canceled after July 21, 2025, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to determine the outcome of the Menifield vs. Sy fight. Looking at the sources:\n\n- Source [3] from cagesidepress.com states that Alonzo Menifield defeated Oumar Sy by unanimous decision (29-28, 29-28, 29-28). This is a clear result indicating Menifield's victory.\n- Source [12] from 411mania.com also confirms the result as Menifield winning by unanimous decision.\n- Other sources like [13], [14], [15], and [16] discuss predictions and odds before the fight but don't contradict the actual result reported in [3] and [12].\n\nThe user's ancillary data says that if Menifield wins, the market resolves to \"Sy\" (p1). However, according to the resolution conditions provided, p2 corresponds to Menifield. Wait, let me double-check the ancillary data:\n\nThe user's ancillary_data states:\n\"If Alonzo Menifield is declared the winner, this market will resolve to 'Sy' (p1). If Oumar Sy wins, resolve to 'Buckley' (p2).\"\n\nBut looking at the resolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Sy, p2 to Menifield, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\nWait, there's a discrepancy here. The description says if Menifield wins, resolve to \"Sy\" (p1), but the res_data seems to map p2 to Menifield. This might be a typo or confusion in the ancillary data. However, the user's instruction says: \"If Alonzo Menifield is declared the winner of this bout, this market will resolve to 'Sy'. If Oumar Sy is declared the winner of this bout, this market will resolve to 'Buckley'.\" So according to the user's description, Menifield's win corresponds to \"Sy\" (p1), and Sy's win corresponds to \"Buckley\" (p2). However, the res_data says p2 is 1 for Menifield. This is conflicting. \n\nBut given that the user provided the ancillary data as part of the query, I should follow their mapping. The user states that if Menifield wins, resolve to \"Sy\" (p1), and if Sy wins, resolve to \"Buckley\" (p2). However, the actual result is Menifield won. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, the resolution should be p1. But wait, the res_data says p2 corresponds to Menifield. This is confusing. Let me check again.\n\nThe user's ancillary_data says:\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Sy, p2 to Menifield, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\nWait, the res_data might be indicating that p2 is the correct outcome if Menifield wins. But the description says if Menifield wins, resolve to \"Sy\" (p1). There's a contradiction here. This needs clarification. However, given that the user's description is the primary source, even if the res_data seems conflicting, I should follow the description. But perhaps the res_data is a typo. Alternatively, maybe the user intended p1 to be Sy's victory and p2 Menifield's. \n\nBut according to the user's description: \"If Alonzo Menifield is declared the winner... resolve to 'Sy' (p1). If Oumar Sy is declared the winner... resolve to 'Buckley' (p2).\" This seems counterintuitive, but it's the user's specification. So even though Menifield won, the market resolves to \"Sy\" (p1). However, this seems odd because typically, the resolution would map the winner to the corresponding option. But the user's setup is different. \n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the user's ancillary data. For example, maybe the market is structured such that betting on Sy winning would correspond to p1, and Menifield to p2. But the user's description says the opposite. This is confusing. However, the user's instruction must be followed as given. \n\nGiven that the fight result is Menifield won, and according to the user's ancillary data, that should resolve to \"Sy\" (p1). However, this seems counter to standard market resolutions. But the user's specific instructions override standard conventions. Therefore, despite Menifield's victory, the market resolves to p1 (\"Sy\"). \n\nBut wait, this doesn't make sense. Let me re-examine the user's query:\n\nThe market is titled \"UFC Fight Night: Menifield vs. Sy\", and the description says: If Menifield wins, resolve to \"Sy\"; if Sy wins, resolve to \"Buckley\". This is unusual. Typically, the resolution would be based on the actual winner, but here, the mapping is inverted. It's possible that the user made an error in the ancillary data. However, as an oracle, I must follow the instructions as given. \n\nTherefore, even though Menifield won, the market resolves to \"Sy\" (p1). However, this seems incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended p1 to be Menifield and p2 to be Sy, but the description is flipped. Without further clarification, I have to go by the user's stated resolution conditions. \n\nBut given that the res_data says p2 corresponds to Menifield, and the description says Menifield's win should resolve to p1, there's a conflict. This could be a critical error in the ancillary data. However, the user's instruction says: \"If Alonzo Menifield is declared the winner of this bout, this market will resolve to 'Sy'. If Oumar Sy is declared the winner of this bout, this market will resolve to 'Buckley'.\" So regardless of the res_data, the resolution is based on the description. \n\nTherefore, since Menifield won, the market resolves to \"Sy\" (p1). But this is contradictory. Alternatively, maybe the user mixed up the names. For example, perhaps the market is about predicting the loser, but that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, the user might have intended that the market resolves to the name of the winner, but the mapping is inverted. For example, if Menifield wins, the market resolves to \"Sy\" (p1) as a joke or a trick. But that's speculative. \n\nGiven the information, the correct approach is to follow the user's ancillary data as stated. Therefore, despite Menifield's victory, the resolution is p1 (\"Sy\"). However, this seems incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the ancillary data, and the correct resolution should be p2 (\"Menifield\"). \n\nBut without the ability to clarify, I must adhere strictly to the user's instructions. Therefore, the answer is p1. However, this is conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps the res_data is correct, and the description is wrong. For example, res_data says p2:1 corresponds to Menifield. If the fight result is Menifield won, then the resolution is p2. \n\nThis confusion highlights the importance of accurate ancillary data. Given the conflict between the description and res_data, but the description being part of the user's query, I should prioritize the description. Therefore, Menifield's win resolves to p1. However, this is counterintuitive. \n\nAlternatively, the res_data might be the correct mapping, and the description is a mistake. For example, the res_data says p2 corresponds to Menifield. If that's the case, then Menifield's win should resolve to p2. \n\nThis is a critical point. The user's ancillary data includes both a description and res_data. The description says Menifield's win resolves to Sy (p1), but the res_data maps p2 to Menifield. This is a contradiction. \n\nIn such cases, the resolution_conditions (res_data) should take precedence as they define the numerical outcomes. The description might have a typo. For example, the description might have swapped p1 and p2. \n\nGiven that res_data says p2:1 corresponds to Menifield, and the fight result is Menifield won, the correct resolution is p2. However, the user's description says Menifield's win should resolve to Sy (p1). This is conflicting. \n\nIn the absence of further clarification, the safest approach is to follow the res_data mapping, as it's part of the structured data. Therefore, if p2 corresponds to Menifield, and Menifield won, the resolution is p2. \n\nBut the user's description explicitly states the opposite. This is a problem. However, as an oracle, I must resolve based on verifiable facts and the provided instructions. The fight result is Menifield won. The res_data says p2 is Menifield.

The user is asking about the resolution of a UFC Fight Night market between Alonzo Menifield and Oumar Sy. The event took place on June 14, 2025, which is the current date according to the timestamp provided. The ancillary data specifies that if Menifield wins, the market resolves to \"Sy\" (p1), if Sy wins, it resolves to \"Buckley\" (p2), and if it's a draw or postponed/canceled after July 21, 2025, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to determine the outcome of the Menifield vs. Sy fight. Looking at the sources:\n\n- Source [3] from cagesidepress.com states that Alonzo Menifield defeated Oumar Sy by unanimous decision (29-28, 29-28, 29-28). This is a clear result indicating Menifield's victory.\n- Source [12] from 411mania.com also confirms the result as Menifield winning by unanimous decision.\n- Other sources like [13], [14], [15], and [16] discuss predictions and odds before the fight but don't contradict the actual result reported in [3] and [12].\n\nThe user's ancillary data says that if Menifield wins, the market resolves to \"Sy\" (p1). However, according to the resolution conditions provided, p2 corresponds to Menifield. Wait, let me double-check the ancillary data:\n\nThe user's ancillary_data states:\n\"If Alonzo Menifield is declared the winner, this market will resolve to 'Sy' (p1). If Oumar Sy wins, resolve to 'Buckley' (p2).\"\n\nBut looking at the resolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Sy, p2 to Menifield, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\nWait, there's a discrepancy here. The description says if Menifield wins, resolve to \"Sy\" (p1), but the res_data seems to map p2 to Menifield. This might be a typo or confusion in the ancillary data. However, the user's instruction says: \"If Alonzo Menifield is declared the winner of this bout, this market will resolve to 'Sy'. If Oumar Sy is declared the winner of this bout, this market will resolve to 'Buckley'.\" So according to the user's description, Menifield's win corresponds to \"Sy\" (p1), and Sy's win corresponds to \"Buckley\" (p2). However, the res_data says p2 is 1 for Menifield. This is conflicting. \n\nBut given that the user provided the ancillary data as part of the query, I should follow their mapping. The user states that if Menifield wins, resolve to \"Sy\" (p1), and if Sy wins, resolve to \"Buckley\" (p2). However, the actual result is Menifield won. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, the resolution should be p1. But wait, the res_data says p2 corresponds to Menifield. This is confusing. Let me check again.\n\nThe user's ancillary_data says:\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Sy, p2 to Menifield, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\nWait, the res_data might be indicating that p2 is the correct outcome if Menifield wins. But the description says if Menifield wins, resolve to \"Sy\" (p1). There's a contradiction here. This needs clarification. However, given that the user's description is the primary source, even if the res_data seems conflicting, I should follow the description. But perhaps the res_data is a typo. Alternatively, maybe the user intended p1 to be Sy's victory and p2 Menifield's. \n\nBut according to the user's description: \"If Alonzo Menifield is declared the winner... resolve to 'Sy' (p1). If Oumar Sy is declared the winner... resolve to 'Buckley' (p2).\" This seems counterintuitive, but it's the user's specification. So even though Menifield won, the market resolves to \"Sy\" (p1). However, this seems odd because typically, the resolution would map the winner to the corresponding option. But the user's setup is different. \n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the user's ancillary data. For example, maybe the market is structured such that betting on Sy winning would correspond to p1, and Menifield to p2. But the user's description says the opposite. This is confusing. However, the user's instruction must be followed as given. \n\nGiven that the fight result is Menifield won, and according to the user's ancillary data, that should resolve to \"Sy\" (p1). However, this seems counter to standard market resolutions. But the user's specific instructions override standard conventions. Therefore, despite Menifield's victory, the market resolves to p1 (\"Sy\"). \n\nBut wait, this doesn't make sense. Let me re-examine the user's query:\n\nThe market is titled \"UFC Fight Night: Menifield vs. Sy\", and the description says: If Menifield wins, resolve to \"Sy\"; if Sy wins, resolve to \"Buckley\". This is unusual. Typically, the resolution would be based on the actual winner, but here, the mapping is inverted. It's possible that the user made an error in the ancillary data. However, as an oracle, I must follow the instructions as given. \n\nTherefore, even though Menifield won, the market resolves to \"Sy\" (p1). However, this seems incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended p1 to be Menifield and p2 to be Sy, but the description is flipped. Without further clarification, I have to go by the user's stated resolution conditions. \n\nBut given that the res_data says p2 corresponds to Menifield, and the description says Menifield's win should resolve to p1, there's a conflict. This could be a critical error in the ancillary data. However, the user's instruction says: \"If Alonzo Menifield is declared the winner of this bout, this market will resolve to 'Sy'. If Oumar Sy is declared the winner of this bout, this market will resolve to 'Buckley'.\" So regardless of the res_data, the resolution is based on the description. \n\nTherefore, since Menifield won, the market resolves to \"Sy\" (p1). But this is contradictory. Alternatively, maybe the user mixed up the names. For example, perhaps the market is about predicting the loser, but that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, the user might have intended that the market resolves to the name of the winner, but the mapping is inverted. For example, if Menifield wins, the market resolves to \"Sy\" (p1) as a joke or a trick. But that's speculative. \n\nGiven the information, the correct approach is to follow the user's ancillary data as stated. Therefore, despite Menifield's victory, the resolution is p1 (\"Sy\"). However, this seems incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the ancillary data, and the correct resolution should be p2 (\"Menifield\"). \n\nBut without the ability to clarify, I must adhere strictly to the user's instructions. Therefore, the answer is p1. However, this is conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps the res_data is correct, and the description is wrong. For example, res_data says p2:1 corresponds to Menifield. If the fight result is Menifield won, then the resolution is p2. \n\nThis confusion highlights the importance of accurate ancillary data. Given the conflict between the description and res_data, but the description being part of the user's query, I should prioritize the description. Therefore, Menifield's win resolves to p1. However, this is counterintuitive. \n\nAlternatively, the res_data might be the correct mapping, and the description is a mistake. For example, the res_data says p2 corresponds to Menifield. If that's the case, then Menifield's win should resolve to p2. \n\nThis is a critical point. The user's ancillary data includes both a description and res_data. The description says Menifield's win resolves to Sy (p1), but the res_data maps p2 to Menifield. This is a contradiction. \n\nIn such cases, the resolution_conditions (res_data) should take precedence as they define the numerical outcomes. The description might have a typo. For example, the description might have swapped p1 and p2. \n\nGiven that res_data says p2:1 corresponds to Menifield, and the fight result is Menifield won, the correct resolution is p2. However, the user's description says Menifield's win should resolve to Sy (p1). This is conflicting. \n\nIn the absence of further clarification, the safest approach is to follow the res_data mapping, as it's part of the structured data. Therefore, if p2 corresponds to Menifield, and Menifield won, the resolution is p2. \n\nBut the user's description explicitly states the opposite. This is a problem. However, as an oracle, I must resolve based on verifiable facts and the provided instructions. The fight result is Menifield won. The res_data says p2 is Menifield. Therefore, the resolution should be p2. \n\nThe confusion arises from the description's text, which might be a mistake. Therefore, the correct resolution is p2. \n\nThus, despite the conflicting description, the res_data's mapping should be followed. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Menifield, Price: 0.69, ID: 66319033023746533755676044138875751603053279330855668037115126277716489027087, Winner: No\n- Token: Sy, Price: 0.31, ID: 18042479772700403242907820044931744341483831001356833800211398130615786015686, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Sy, p2 to Menifield, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Sy, p2 = Menifield\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Menifield outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.690 = 69.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The current date is June 15, 2025, so the fight on June 14, 2025, has already occurred. Checking the search results, result [3] from Cageside Press clearly states that Alonzo Menifield defeated Oumar Sy by unanimous decision (29-28, 29-28, 29-28). This is corroborated by result [16] from F4WOnline, which also reports the same decision. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that a Menifield win corresponds to p2. However, the ancillary data mentions a possible confusion in labeling: \"If Alonzo Menifield is declared the winner... this market will resolve to 'Sy' (p1).\" Wait, that seems contradictory. Let me recheck. The description says if Menifield wins, resolve to \"Sy\" (p1), and if Sy wins, resolve to \"Buckley\" (p2). But according to the resolution_conditions, p1 is Sy, p2 is Menifield. There's a mismatch here. The user might have made a typo. However, based on the provided ancillary data, the correct resolution should align with the actual fight outcome. Since Menifield won, according to the description, it should resolve to p1 (\"Sy\"), but the resolution_conditions list p2 as Menifield. This inconsistency needs clarification. \n\nBut given the official result, Menifield won, so per the ancillary data's description, the market should resolve to p1. However, the resolution_conditions might have a typo. The user needs to ensure that the labels match. Assuming the description is correct, despite the resolution_conditions' p1 and p2 labels, the correct resolution is p1. However, the final answer should follow the resolution_conditions as provided. If p2 corresponds to Menifield, then the recommendation is p2. But this requires careful cross-verification. \n\nGiven the confusion, the safest approach is to follow the resolution_conditions as stated: p1: Sy, p2: Menifield. Since Menifield won, the recommendation is p2. However, the user must ensure the ancillary data's alignment. But based on the evidence, Menifield won, so p2 is correct.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the UFC Fight Night bout between Alonzo Menifield and Oumar Sy. The ancillary data specifies that if Menifield wins, the market resolves to \"Sy\" (p1), if Sy wins, it resolves to \"Buckley\" (p2), and a draw or unresolved outcome leads to a 50-50 split (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to verify the event's outcome.

But based on the evidence, Menifield won, so p2 is correct.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Menifield, Price: 0.69, ID: 66319033023746533755676044138875751603053279330855668037115126277716489027087, Winner: No\n- Token: Sy, Price: 0.31, ID: 18042479772700403242907820044931744341483831001356833800211398130615786015686, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Sy, p2 to Menifield, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Sy, p2 = Menifield\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Menifield outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.690 = 69.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
