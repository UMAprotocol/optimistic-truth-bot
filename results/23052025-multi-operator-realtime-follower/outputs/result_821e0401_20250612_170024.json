Try other solvers or a combination approach.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: perplexity\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\"), college football (e.g., \"What was the score of the Alabama game last Saturday?\"), college basketball (e.g., \"What was Duke's score in their last game?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the G2 vs. 3DMAX match at the BLAST.tv Austin Major on June 12, 2025. The resolution depends on who wins the match. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already happened. The current date given is June 12, 2025, 4:54:23 PM UTC. The match was scheduled for June 12, 2025, at 4:15 PM UTC. Since the current time is after the match time, the event should have concluded.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources like Strafe and HLTV mention the match details. The key points from the search results are:\n\n1. The match is a Best of 1 series as part of the Swiss stage of the tournament [2][10][24].\n2. Historical head-to-head records show G2 has won 4 out of 5 previous encounters, with the most recent being a 2-1 victory on May 21, 2025 [2][8][11].\n3. Current rankings: G2 is ranked #6, while 3DMAX is #13 or #16 depending on the source [2][13][19].\n4. Recent form: G2 has won 2 of their last 5 matches, 3DMAX has won 3 of their last 5 [2][13][19].\n5. Predictions and user polls slightly favor G2, with around 53.5% expecting a G2 win [2][10][24].\n\nHowever, none of the provided search results explicitly state the outcome of the specific June 12 match. Some sources like [2][10][24] mention the match is upcoming or provide predictions, but no post-match results are included. The HLTV link in the resolution source (https://www.hltv.org/events/7902/blasttv-austin-major-2025) isn't directly accessible in the provided search results, but the HLTV results page [31] doesn't list this specific match result as of the current timestamp.\n\nSince the match date is in the past relative to the current timestamp and there's no verifiable outcome provided in the sources, the next step is to infer the most probable outcome based on available data. G2 has a better historical record against 3DMAX, higher ranking, and recent head-to-head victory. However, 3DMAX has a slightly better recent form. \n\nBut according to the user's personalization instructions, if the event date is in the past and no outcome is available, we should assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. Given G2's higher ranking and historical dominance, the probable outcome is a G2 win. Therefore, the resolution should be p2 (G2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749747154 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-12 16:52:34 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the G2 vs. 3DMAX match at the BLAST.tv Austin Major on June 12, 2025. The resolution depends on who wins the match. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already happened. The current date given is June 12, 2025, 4:54:23 PM UTC. The match was scheduled for June 12, 2025, at 4:15 PM UTC. Since the current time is after the match time, the event should have concluded.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources like Strafe and HLTV mention the match details. The key points from the search results are:\n\n1. The match is a Best of 1 series as part of the Swiss stage of the tournament [2][10][24].\n2. Historical head-to-head records show G2 has won 4 out of 5 previous encounters, with the most recent being a 2-1 victory on May 21, 2025 [2][8][11].\n3. Current rankings: G2 is ranked #6, while 3DMAX is #13 or #16 depending on the source [2][13][19].\n4. Recent form: G2 has won 2 of their last 5 matches, 3DMAX has won 3 of their last 5 [2][13][19].\n5. Predictions and user polls slightly favor G2, with around 53.5% expecting a G2 win [2][10][24].\n\nHowever, none of the provided search results explicitly state the outcome of the specific June 12 match. Some sources like [2][10][24] mention the match is upcoming or provide predictions, but no post-match results are included. The HLTV link in the resolution source (https://www.hltv.org/events/7902/blasttv-austin-major-2025) isn't directly accessible in the provided search results, but the HLTV results page [31] doesn't list this specific match result as of the current timestamp.\n\nSince the match date is in the past relative to the current timestamp and there's no verifiable outcome provided in the sources, the next step is to infer the most probable outcome based on available data. G2 has a better historical record against 3DMAX, higher ranking, and recent head-to-head victory. However, 3DMAX has a slightly better recent form. \n\nBut according to the user's personalization instructions, if the event date is in the past and no outcome is available, we should assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. Given G2's higher ranking and historical dominance, the probable outcome is a G2 win. Therefore, the resolution should be p2 (G2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: G2, Price: 0.015, ID: 48853652963293305091280479117806519536735293595520005093936555061228908926931, Winner: No\n- Token: 3DMAX, Price: 0.985, ID: 74258981749784128713325322642814633526158400386037871029795476828933860975789, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to 3DMAX, p2 to G2, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = 3DMAX, p2 = G2\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors 3DMAX outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.985 = 98.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of the G2 vs. 3DMAX match in the BLAST.tv Austin Major. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"G2\" (p2) if they win, \"3DMAX\" (p1) if they win, and 50-50 (p3) if there's a tie, cancellation, or delay beyond June 28, 2025. The current timestamp is June 12, 2025, 16:52:34 UTC, which is the same day as the match scheduled for 12:15 PM ET (which is 16:15 UTC). So the match should have already occurred.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for information on the match outcome. Looking through the provided sources, several mention the head-to-head record between G2 and 3DMAX. For example, sources [2], [4], [25], and others indicate that in their last 5 encounters, G2 has won 4 times, and 3DMAX once. The most recent match before the Major was on May 21, 2025, where G2 won 2-1 [2][4][17][28]. \n\nHowever, the critical point is the specific match on June 12, 2025. Sources [4], [10], [18], [27], [35], [39], [45], [53], [61], [68] all state that the match is scheduled for June 12, 2025, at 4:15 PM UTC (which aligns with 12:15 PM ET). These sources also mention that it's a Best of 1 (Bo1) series as part of the Swiss stage. \n\nNow, the key is whether there's any report of the match result. The search results provided don't include any post-match reports or updates indicating the outcome. All mentions of the match are either previews, predictions, or schedules. For instance, source [56] from scores24.live gives a prediction favoring 3DMAX, but it's dated June 12, 2025, and doesn't confirm the result. Similarly, source [26] is an interview with G2's Hades discussing the upcoming match, not the result. \n\nThe user's previous response recommended p2 (G2), but the user is asking to try again. Since the current timestamp is after the match's scheduled time, but no sources confirm the result, I need to check if there's any indication of cancellation, delay, or tie. The resolution conditions state that if the match is delayed beyond June 28, 2025, it resolves to p3. However, the current date is June 12, so a delay beyond June 28 isn't applicable yet. \n\nGiven that the match was supposed to happen today and there's no information on cancellation or delay, but also no confirmed result, the next step is to infer the most probable outcome based on available data. The head-to-head record favors G2, and some predictions (like [56]) suggest 3DMAX might win, but without official confirmation, it's tricky. However, the user's personalization instructions say that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome exists, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions unless contradicted. \n\nBut wait, the user's personalization also mentions that if the event is scheduled for the same day but a later time, it's still considered future. The match was at 16:15 UTC, and the current time is 16:52:34 UTC, which is after the match time. However, without any sources reporting the result, it's possible the match hasn't concluded yet or the result isn't published. But given the time has passed, it's more likely the match has occurred. \n\nSince there's no official result in the provided sources, and the user's previous answer was p2, perhaps the correct approach is to check if there's any update. However, all sources are either previews or historical data. Without a confirmed result, the resolution should default to p3 (50-50) if the outcome isn't verifiable. But the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nGiven the head-to-head and recent form, G2 might be the probable winner, but 3DMAX has been performing well. However, without explicit confirmation, the safe answer might be p3. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data's resolution source is HLTV, but the provided HLTV links ([8], [11], [23], [48]) don't show the match result. \n\nWait, source [23] (HLTV matches page) lists the match as happening on June 12, but the content is a generic coverage statement without specific results. Since the resolution source is HLTV, and it's not provided in the search results, the assistant can't access it. Therefore, based on the provided context, there's no confirmation. \n\nHowever, the user's personalization says to answer based on provided search results. Since all sources are pre-match, and the event date is today but after the scheduled time, but no result is available, the correct resolution would be p3 (unknown/50-50) because the outcome isn't verifiable from the given data. But the user's previous answer was p2, and they want a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the match was played, and the lack of results in the provided sources implies it hasn't been updated. But according to the instructions, if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. The most recent match between them on May 21 was a G2 win, and G2 is ranked higher. So perhaps p2 is still correct. But the user wants a different approach. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since the match date is today, which is in the past relative to the current timestamp (same day but time has passed), and no info, we have to assume based on conditions. The ancillary data's resolution conditions don't mention postponement, so if the match occurred as scheduled, but no result is found, perhaps it's a 50-50. But the user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nGiven the conflict, but the user's previous answer was p2, maybe the correct answer is p2, but the user wants to check again. However, without any result in the provided sources, the assistant can't confirm. Therefore, the recommendation should be p3 (50-50) due to lack of verifiable information. But I need to check the exact instructions again. \n\nThe user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, and no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nSo, since the event date is in the past (June 12 is the same day as the current timestamp, but the match time was 16:15 UTC, and current time is 16:52, so it's in the past), and no info on outcome, we assume the most probable outcome. The conditions in the ancillary data don't specify how to determine the probable outcome, but the search results indicate G2 has a better H2H and higher ranking. Therefore, the recommendation would be p2 (G2). However, some sources like [56] predict 3DMAX, but that's a prediction, not a result. \n\nGiven the instructions, the correct answer is p2, as the most probable outcome based on historical data, even if the actual result isn't confirmed in the provided sources. Therefore, despite the previous answer being p2, the correct recommendation remains p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

However, without any sources reporting the result, it's possible the match hasn't concluded yet or the result isn't published. But given the time has passed, it's more likely the match has occurred. \n\nSince there's no official result in the provided sources, and the user's previous answer was p2, perhaps the correct approach is to check if there's any update. However, all sources are either previews or historical data. Without a confirmed result, the resolution should default to p3 (50-50) if the outcome isn't verifiable. But the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nGiven the head-to-head and recent form, G2 might be the probable winner, but 3DMAX has been performing well. However, without explicit confirmation, the safe answer might be p3. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data's resolution source is HLTV, but the provided HLTV links ([8], [11], [23], [48]) don't show the match result. \n\nWait, source [23] (HLTV matches page) lists the match as happening on June 12, but the content is a generic coverage statement without specific results. Since the resolution source is HLTV, and it's not provided in the search results, the assistant can't access it. Therefore, based on the provided context, there's no confirmation. \n\nHowever, the user's personalization says to answer based on provided search results. Since all sources are pre-match, and the event date is today but after the scheduled time, but no result is available, the correct resolution would be p3 (unknown/50-50) because the outcome isn't verifiable from the given data. But the user's previous answer was p2, and they want a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the match was played, and the lack of results in the provided sources implies it hasn't been updated. But according to the instructions, if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. The most recent match between them on May 21 was a G2 win, and G2 is ranked higher. So perhaps p2 is still correct. But the user wants a different approach. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since the match date is today, which is in the past relative to the current timestamp (same day but time has passed), and no info, we have to assume based on conditions. The ancillary data's resolution conditions don't mention postponement, so if the match occurred as scheduled, but no result is found, perhaps it's a 50-50. But the user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nGiven the conflict, but the user's previous answer was p2, maybe the correct answer is p2, but the user wants to check again. However, without any result in the provided sources, the assistant can't confirm. Therefore, the recommendation should be p3 (50-50) due to lack of verifiable information. But I need to check the exact instructions again. \n\nThe user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, and no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nSo, since the event date is in the past (June 12 is the same day as the current timestamp, but the match time was 16:15 UTC, and current time is 16:52, so it's in the past), and no info on outcome, we assume the most probable outcome. The conditions in the ancillary data don't specify how to determine the probable outcome, but the search results indicate G2 has a better H2H and higher ranking. Therefore, the recommendation would be p2 (G2). However, some sources like [56] predict 3DMAX, but that's a prediction, not a result. \n\nGiven the instructions, the correct answer is p2, as the most probable outcome based on historical data, even if the actual result isn't confirmed in the provided sources. Therefore, despite the previous answer being p2, the correct recommendation remains p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: G2, Price: 0.015, ID: 48853652963293305091280479117806519536735293595520005093936555061228908926931, Winner: No\n- Token: 3DMAX, Price: 0.985, ID: 74258981749784128713325322642814633526158400386037871029795476828933860975789, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to 3DMAX, p2 to G2, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = 3DMAX, p2 = G2\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors 3DMAX outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.985 = 98.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a prediction market regarding the outcome of the G2 vs. 3DMAX match at the BLAST.tv Austin Major. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"G2\" (p2) if they win, \"3DMAX\" (p1) if they win, and p3 (50-50) if there's a tie, cancellation, or delay beyond June 28, 2025.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The provided current timestamp is 2025-06-12 16:52:34 UTC, which is June 12, 2025, at 4:52 PM UTC. The match was scheduled for June 12, 2025, at 12:15 PM ET, which is 16:15 UTC. So the match time was 16:15 UTC, and the current time is 16:52 UTC, meaning the match should have already started or concluded.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources (like [3], [10], [16], [23], [33], [40], [48], [56], [65]) mention the match date as June 12, 2025, at 4:15 PM UTC. The current time is past that, so the event has occurred. The next step is to determine the outcome.\n\nSearch results [3], [10], [16], [23], [33], [40], [48], [56], [65] all describe the match as part of the BLAST.tv Austin Major, a Best of 1 series in the Swiss stage. However, none of the provided search results explicitly state the outcome of this specific match. Some sources like [3] and [10] mention that the last match between them on May 21, 2025, was won by G2, but that's a previous encounter.\n\nThere's a mention in [61] about Legacy's upset over Vitality, but that's a different match. Other sources like [64] refer to a previous match in May 2025 where G2 won, but not the June 12th match. The HLTV link provided in the ancillary data (source [9], [34]) doesn't have specific match results in the provided snippets. \n\nSince the user's previous response was p2 (G2 win) and they asked to check alternative sources, I need to re-examine the data. The absence of explicit result mentions in the search results might indicate that the match hasn't been reported yet, or the provided snippets don't include the outcome. However, given the current timestamp is after the match time, and there's no mention of cancellation or delay, the resolution should rely on the most probable outcome based on available data.\n\nLooking at head-to-head stats from [7], [19], G2 has won 4 out of 5 matches against 3DMAX. Recent form from [3], [10] shows G2 ranked #6 and 3DMAX #13. Strafe users predicted G2 to win with 53.5% votes. However, some sources like [22], [44], [51], [60], [63] predict a possible 3DMAX upset due to G2's recent struggles. \n\nBut according to the instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, we should assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data's resolution source is HLTV, but the provided HLTV snippets don't show the result. However, the user's personalization instructs to resolve based on the most probable outcome if no info is available. Given G2's historical edge and higher ranking, the recommendation would be p2 (G2). However, the user's previous attempt was p2, and they want a different approach. \n\nWait, the user mentioned that the previous response was p2 and asked to check alternative data. But if the match occurred and there's no result in the sources, perhaps it's a case where the outcome isn't reported yet, leading to p3. However, the event date is today, and the match time has passed. The resolution conditions say if delayed beyond June 28, resolve to p3. Since the current date is June 12, the delay clause isn't triggered. \n\nBut without explicit results in the provided sources, and given the instructions to assume the most probable outcome, the answer remains p2. However, the user's additional instructions say to consider if data availability is an issue. Since the sources don't confirm the result, maybe the match is ongoing or unreported, leading to p3. But the timestamp is after the match time, so it's likely concluded. \n\nWait, looking at source [61], which is dated June 12, 2025, it talks about Legacy's upset on the same day, indicating that the tournament is ongoing and results are coming in. If HLTV is the resolution source but the provided snippets don't include the G2 vs. 3DMAX result, perhaps the match hasn't been updated yet. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nGiven the conflicting info and the need to follow the resolution conditions, if the match occurred but no result is found, and it's not delayed beyond June 28, the resolution should be based on the most probable outcome, which is G2 (p2). However, the user's previous attempt was p2, and they want a different approach. Maybe the match was delayed, but the current date is June 12, and the delay clause is beyond June 28, which hasn't happened. Therefore, the correct resolution is p2. But since the user wants a different approach, perhaps checking if the match was indeed played. \n\nAlternatively, some sources like [3], [10] mention the match is on June 12 at 4:15 PM UTC, which is the same as the current time (16:52 UTC). If the match started at 16:15, it might still be ongoing, but given it's a Best of 1, it should have concluded. However, without result data, the safe resolution is p3. But according to the instructions, if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Therefore, despite the user's previous p2, the correct answer remains p2. However, the user's additional instruction says to consider market conditions. Since the user wants a different approach, maybe the match was delayed, but the delay is not beyond June 28, so it's still pending. But the current date is June 12, so the delay isn't beyond June 28 yet. Therefore, the market shouldn't resolve to p3 yet. \n\nThis is confusing. The key is whether the match occurred and the result is available. Since the search results don't provide the outcome, but the event date is today and the time has passed, the resolution should be based on the most probable outcome, which is G2 (p2). Therefore, despite the user's previous p2, the correct answer is still p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749747154 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-12 16:52:34 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p2.

If the match started at 16:15, it might still be ongoing, but given it's a Best of 1, it should have concluded. However, without result data, the safe resolution is p3. But according to the instructions, if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Therefore, despite the user's previous p2, the correct answer remains p2. However, the user's additional instruction says to consider market conditions. Since the user wants a different approach, maybe the match was delayed, but the delay is not beyond June 28, so it's still pending. But the current date is June 12, so the delay isn't beyond June 28 yet. Therefore, the market shouldn't resolve to p3 yet. \n\nThis is confusing. The key is whether the match occurred and the result is available. Since the search results don't provide the outcome, but the event date is today and the time has passed, the resolution should be based on the most probable outcome, which is G2 (p2). Therefore, despite the user's previous p2, the correct answer is still p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: G2, Price: 0.015, ID: 48853652963293305091280479117806519536735293595520005093936555061228908926931, Winner: No\n- Token: 3DMAX, Price: 0.985, ID: 74258981749784128713325322642814633526158400386037871029795476828933860975789, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to 3DMAX, p2 to G2, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = 3DMAX, p2 = G2\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors 3DMAX outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.985 = 98.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: BLAST.tv Austin Major: G2 vs. 3DMAX, description: G2 and 3DMAX are scheduled to play each other in round 1 of the BLAST.tv Austin Major Tournament on June 12, 2025, at 12:15\u00e2\u0080\u00afPM\u00e2\u0080\u00afET.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"G2\" if G2 win against 3DMAX in round 1 of the BLAST.tv Austin Major Tournament.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"3DMAX\" if 3DMAX win against G2 in round 1 of the BLAST.tv Austin Major Tournament.\n\nIf the match ends in a tie, is canceled, or delayed beyond June 28, 2025, this market will resolve to 50\u00e2\u0080\u009150.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be official information from the HLTV (https://www.hltv.org/events/7902/blasttv-austin-major-2025) market_id: 551693\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to 3DMAX, p2 to G2, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749747154 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-12 16:52:34 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\n# Load environment variables\nload_dotenv()\n\n# API keys loaded from environment variables\nHLTV_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_CBB_API_KEY\")\n\n# Constants for the event\nEVENT_DATE = \"2025-06-12\"\nTEAM1 = \"3DMAX\"\nTEAM2 = \"G2\"\nEVENT_URL = \"https://www.hltv.org/events/7902/blasttv-austin-major-2025\"\n\n# Headers for HTTP requests\nHEADERS = {\"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key\": HLTV_API_KEY}\n\ndef fetch_event_results():\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches the results of the BLAST.tv Austin Major: G2 vs. 3DMAX match from HLTV.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(EVENT_URL, headers=HEADERS, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n        \n        # Find the specific match data\n        for match in data.get('matches', []):\n            if match['team1']['name'] == TEAM1 and match['team2']['name'] == TEAM2:\n                if match['date'][:10] == EVENT_DATE:\n                    return match\n        return None\n    except requests.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error fetching event results: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef determine_outcome(match_data):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the outcome of the match based on the fetched data.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not match_data:\n        return \"p3\"  # Assume 50-50 if no data is found or match is not on the expected date\n\n    if match_data['status'] in ['Postponed', 'Canceled']:\n        return \"p3\"  # 50-50 for postponed or canceled matches\n\n    winner = match_data['winner']['name']\n    if winner == TEAM1:\n        return \"p1\"  # 3DMAX wins\n    elif winner == TEAM2:\n        return \"p2\"  # G2 wins\n    else:\n        return \"p3\"  # 50-50 for any other unexpected outcome\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    match_data = fetch_event_results()\n    recommendation = determine_outcome(match_data)\n    print(f\"recommendation: {recommendation}\")\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nError fetching event results: 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.hltv.org/events/7902/blasttv-austin-major-2025\nrecommendation: p3\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Where p1 corresponds to 3DMAX, p2 to G2, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = 3DMAX, p2 = G2\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors 3DMAX outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.985 = 98.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Where p1 corresponds to 3DMAX, p2 to G2, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality.

Recommendation found: p4.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p4\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: G2, Price: 0.015, ID: 48853652963293305091280479117806519536735293595520005093936555061228908926931, Winner: No\n- Token: 3DMAX, Price: 0.985, ID: 74258981749784128713325322642814633526158400386037871029795476828933860975789, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to 3DMAX, p2 to G2, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = 3DMAX, p2 = G2\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors 3DMAX outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.985 = 98.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Removing all command-line argument handling\n2. Using dotenv to load API keys from environment variables\n3. Extracting required info (dates, teams, etc.) directly from the question\n4. Making the code runnable with no arguments\n5. Handling errors gracefully\n6. Returning results in a clear format (either JSON or plaintext with a 'recommendation: X' line)\n\nFor NHL hockey data:\n- Use Sports Data IO API with the SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY from environment variables\n- Use python-dotenv to load the API key:\n  ```python\n  from dotenv import load_dotenv\n  import os\n  \n  load_dotenv()\n  api_key = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\")\n  ```\n- Extract team names and dates from the question\n- The team abbreviations for NHL are:\n  * Seattle Kraken = SEA\n  * Vegas Golden Knights = VGK\n  * Toronto Maple Leafs = TOR\n  * Boston Bruins = BOS\n  * And other standard NHL team abbreviations\n- CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: When defining RESOLUTION_MAP, you MUST use team abbreviations (not full names) as keys:\n  ```python\n  # CORRECT - Use team abbreviations as keys\n  RESOLUTION_MAP = {\n      \"VGK\": \"p1\",  # Golden Knights\n      \"SEA\": \"p2\",  # Kraken\n      \"50-50\": \"p3\",\n      \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\",\n  }\n  \n  # WRONG - Do NOT use full team names as keys\n  # RESOLUTION_MAP = {\n  #     \"Golden Knights\": \"p1\",  # Wrong!

Where p1 corresponds to 3DMAX, p2 to G2, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749747154 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-12 16:52:34 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p3.

Recommendation found: p3.\n\nOutput:\nError fetching data: 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.hltv.org/events/7902/blasttv-austin-major-2025\nrecommendation: p3\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: G2, Price: 0.015, ID: 48853652963293305091280479117806519536735293595520005093936555061228908926931, Winner: No\n- Token: 3DMAX, Price: 0.985, ID: 74258981749784128713325322642814633526158400386037871029795476828933860975789, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to 3DMAX, p2 to G2, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = 3DMAX, p2 = G2\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors 3DMAX outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.985 = 98.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
