      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Wildcard vs. Metizport match in the BLAST.tv Austin Major Stage 1. The event date is June 3, 2025, at 2:45 PM ET. The resolution depends on who wins, with specific conditions for ties, cancellations, or delays beyond June 28, 2025.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The provided current timestamp is June 3, 2025, 19:07:42 UTC. The match is scheduled for June 3, 2025, at 2:45 PM ET, which is 18:45 UTC. Since the current time is 19:07 UTC, the match should have already occurred. However, the search results don't explicitly state the outcome yet. \n\nLooking at the search results, sources like HLTV, Liquipedia, and others provide details about the tournament structure, team lineups, and predictions. Some sources mention that the match is upcoming or provide pre-match analysis. For example, search result [13] from skin.club gives a detailed prediction, suggesting it's a close match but leans towards Metizport. However, predictions aren't official results.\n\nThe user specified that the resolution source is HLTV. Checking the HLTV links provided (search results [1], [2], [25], [49], [51]), none of them list the match result yet. The most recent info from HLTV is about the schedule and team overviews but not the actual outcome. \n\nSince the match time has passed but there's no official result reported in the provided sources, I need to determine if the event was delayed or canceled. The resolution conditions state that if the match is delayed beyond June 28, 2025, it resolves to 50-50. However, the current date is June 3, so the delay clause doesn't apply yet. \n\nGiven that the match was supposed to happen today and there's no result available in the sources, it's possible the result hasn't been updated yet. But according to the rules, if no verifiable outcome is available and the event date is in the past, we assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p2 as Wildcard winning. However, the user's personalization instructions say to resolve based on verified facts. \n\nWait, the personalization section mentions that if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on the user prompt's conditions. The user's ancillary data here says p2 is Wildcard. But the actual conditions in the query's resolution_conditions have p1 as Metizport, p2 as Wildcard. So if we can't verify the result, but the event date is past, we need to check if the user prompt's ancillary data specifies a default. The user's instructions say if no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided. However, the query's ancillary data doesn't specify a default; it just maps outcomes to p1, p2, p3.\n\nBut the personalization also states that if the event is in the past and no info, and not postponed/canceled, resolve based on the most probable outcome per the user's ancillary data. However, without any sources confirming the result, and given that the match was today, it's possible the result isn't out yet. But the current time is just an hour after the match, so maybe the result isn't updated. However, the user's instructions say to use the provided sources. Since none of the sources have the result, and the event date is today, but the match time has passed, we might have to default to p3 (50-50) if the result isn't found. But wait, the resolution conditions say if the match is canceled or delayed beyond June 28, it's p3. Since it's June 3, the delay beyond June 28 hasn't happened. If the match was played but the result isn't reported, does that count as canceled? Or is it considered to have happened, but the info isn't available? The user's instruction says if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The conditions in the query's ancillary data don't specify a default, but the resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5 for unknown. However, the personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the user's ancillary data. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" So in this case, the ancillary data's resolution_conditions have p2 as Wildcard. But how do we determine the most probable outcome? The search results have some predictions, like [13] and [24] suggesting Metizport might win, but others like [23] and [57] lean towards Wildcard. However, these are predictions, not results. Since the resolution source is HLTV, and HLTV hasn't updated the result yet, we can't confirm. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, if no verifiable info is available, we have to assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But the conditions in the ancillary data don't specify a default; they just map outcomes to p1, p2, p3. The user's personalization says to default to p4 if the event is in the future, but here it's in the past. Wait, the personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" So since the event date is in the past (June 3, 2025, and current date is same day but after the match time), and no sources contradict, we need to assume the most probable outcome. But how to determine that? The ancillary data's resolution_conditions don't indicate a default, but the market is set to resolve to Wildcard (p2) if they win, Metizport (p1) if they win. Without official results, but considering the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, perhaps we look at the bookmakers' odds from the search results. For example, in [9], the odds are Wildcard 1.78, Metizport 1.86, indicating Wildcard is slightly favored. However, other sources like [13] predict Metizport. But the user's instructions say to rely on official sources. Since HLTV is the resolution source and it's not updated, perhaps the answer is p3 (50-50). But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, the problem is that the match was today, and maybe the result isn't out yet. But according to the current timestamp, it's past the match time. If the match was played and no result is found, but it's supposed to be resolved via HLTV, and HLTV hasn't updated, then perhaps it's unresolved. However, the user's instructions say if no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without official confirmation, it's risky. Alternatively, maybe the match was played, and the result is available but not in the provided search results. Wait, the search results provided include up to [62], but none show the actual result. Therefore, based on the given information, there's no verifiable outcome. Thus, according to the resolution conditions, if the match is canceled or delayed beyond June 28, it's p3. Since it's June 3, the delay beyond June 28 hasn't occurred. If the match was played but the result isn't reported, it's unclear. However, the user's instruction says if no verifiable info, and the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable outcome here, based on bookmakers' odds (Wildcard favored in some sources), but it's conflicting. However, the resolution source is HLTV, which hasn't reported it. Therefore, the safest answer is p3 (50-50) because the result isn't verifiable from the provided sources. But wait, the resolution conditions say if the match ends in a tie, is canceled, or delayed beyond June 28, it's p3. Since the match was supposed to happen today and there's no result, but it's not delayed beyond June 28, does that mean it's considered canceled or unresolved? The user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, without any info, perhaps we have to default to p3. But I'm confused because the conditions for p3 include the match being canceled or delayed beyond June 28, which isn't the case here. Alternatively, if the match was played but the result isn't available, it's considered unknown, hence p3. Therefore, the recommendation is p3.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3",

The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Wildcard vs. Metizport match in the BLAST.tv Austin Major Stage 1. The event date is June 3, 2025, at 2:45 PM ET. The resolution depends on who wins, with specific conditions for ties, cancellations, or delays beyond June 28, 2025.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The provided current timestamp is June 3, 2025, 19:07:42 UTC. The match is scheduled for June 3, 2025, at 2:45 PM ET, which is 18:45 UTC. Since the current time is 19:07 UTC, the match should have already occurred. However, the search results don't explicitly state the outcome yet. \n\nLooking at the search results, sources like HLTV, Liquipedia, and others provide details about the tournament structure, team lineups, and predictions. Some sources mention that the match is upcoming or provide pre-match analysis. For example, search result [13] from skin.club gives a detailed prediction, suggesting it's a close match but leans towards Metizport. However, predictions aren't official results.\n\nThe user specified that the resolution source is HLTV. Checking the HLTV links provided (search results [1], [2], [25], [49], [51]), none of them list the match result yet. The most recent info from HLTV is about the schedule and team overviews but not the actual outcome. \n\nSince the match time has passed but there's no official result reported in the provided sources, I need to determine if the event was delayed or canceled. The resolution conditions state that if the match is delayed beyond June 28, 2025, it resolves to 50-50. However, the current date is June 3, so the delay clause doesn't apply yet. \n\nGiven that the match was supposed to happen today and there's no result available in the sources, it's possible the result hasn't been updated yet. But according to the rules, if no verifiable outcome is available and the event date is in the past, we assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p2 as Wildcard winning. However, the user's personalization instructions say to resolve based on verified facts. \n\nWait, the personalization section mentions that if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on the user prompt's conditions. The user's ancillary data here says p2 is Wildcard. But the actual conditions in the query's resolution_conditions have p1 as Metizport, p2 as Wildcard. So if we can't verify the result, but the event date is past, we need to check if the user prompt's ancillary data specifies a default. The user's instructions say if no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided. However, the query's ancillary data doesn't specify a default; it just maps outcomes to p1, p2, p3.\n\nBut the personalization also states that if the event is in the past and no info, and not postponed/canceled, resolve based on the most probable outcome per the user's ancillary data. However, without any sources confirming the result, and given that the match was today, it's possible the result isn't out yet. But the current time is just an hour after the match, so maybe the result isn't updated. However, the user's instructions say to use the provided sources. Since none of the sources have the result, and the event date is today, but the match time has passed, we might have to default to p3 (50-50) if the result isn't found. But wait, the resolution conditions say if the match is canceled or delayed beyond June 28, it's p3. Since it's June 3, the delay beyond June 28 hasn't happened. If the match was played but the result isn't reported, does that count as canceled? Or is it considered to have happened, but the info isn't available? The user's instruction says if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The conditions in the query's ancillary data don't specify a default, but the resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5 for unknown. However, the personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the user's ancillary data. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" So in this case, the ancillary data's resolution_conditions have p2 as Wildcard. But how do we determine the most probable outcome? The search results have some predictions, like [13] and [24] suggesting Metizport might win, but others like [23] and [57] lean towards Wildcard. However, these are predictions, not results. Since the resolution source is HLTV, and HLTV hasn't updated the result yet, we can't confirm. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, if no verifiable info is available, we have to assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But the conditions in the ancillary data don't specify a default; they just map outcomes to p1, p2, p3. The user's personalization says to default to p4 if the event is in the future, but here it's in the past. Wait, the personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" So since the event date is in the past (June 3, 2025, and current date is same day but after the match time), and no sources contradict, we need to assume the most probable outcome. But how to determine that? The ancillary data's resolution_conditions don't indicate a default, but the market is set to resolve to Wildcard (p2) if they win, Metizport (p1) if they win. Without official results, but considering the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, perhaps we look at the bookmakers' odds from the search results. For example, in [9], the odds are Wildcard 1.78, Metizport 1.86, indicating Wildcard is slightly favored. However, other sources like [13] predict Metizport. But the user's instructions say to rely on official sources. Since HLTV is the resolution source and it's not updated, perhaps the answer is p3 (50-50). But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, the problem is that the match was today, and maybe the result isn't out yet. But according to the current timestamp, it's past the match time. If the match was played and no result is found, but it's supposed to be resolved via HLTV, and HLTV hasn't updated, then perhaps it's unresolved. However, the user's instructions say if no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without official confirmation, it's risky. Alternatively, maybe the match was played, and the result is available but not in the provided search results. Wait, the search results provided include up to [62], but none show the actual result. Therefore, based on the given information, there's no verifiable outcome. Thus, according to the resolution conditions, if the match is canceled or delayed beyond June 28, it's p3. Since it's June 3, the delay beyond June 28 hasn't occurred. If the match was played but the result isn't reported, it's unclear. However, the user's instruction says if no verifiable info, and the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable outcome here, based on bookmakers' odds (Wildcard favored in some sources), but it's conflicting. However, the resolution source is HLTV, which hasn't reported it. Therefore, the safest answer is p3 (50-50) because the result isn't verifiable from the provided sources. But wait, the resolution conditions say if the match ends in a tie, is canceled, or delayed beyond June 28, it's p3. Since the match was supposed to happen today and there's no result, but it's not delayed beyond June 28, does that mean it's considered canceled or unresolved? The user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, without any info, perhaps we have to default to p3. But I'm confused because the conditions for p3 include the match being canceled or delayed beyond June 28, which isn't the case here. Alternatively, if the match was played but the result isn't available, it's considered unknown, hence p3. Therefore, the recommendation is p3.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Wildcard, Price: 0.9895, ID: 78179192746735712221671564016263007130118466366842226877266705615050668275346, Winner: No\n- Token: Metizport, Price: 0.0105, ID: 105484865903903869749782522999909453301390110034166695075623677575898472335311, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Metizport, p2 to Wildcard, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Metizport, p2 = Wildcard\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Wildcard outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.990 = 99.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1748977662 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-03 19:07:42 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please re-evaluate the query considering the strong market sentiment favoring Wildcard and ensure the recommendation aligns with this sentiment.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Wildcard vs. Metizport match at the BLAST.tv Austin Major. The market resolves to Wildcard (p2) if they win, Metizport (p1) if they win, and 50-50 (p3) if there's a tie, delay, or cancellation after June 28, 2025.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already happened. The current date given is June 3, 2025, and the match is scheduled for the same day at 2:45 PM ET. Since the timestamp provided is 2025-06-03 19:07:42 UTC, which is after the match time (2:45 PM ET is 18:45 UTC), the match should have concluded. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources (like [3], [6], [11], [20], [28], [35], [46], [50], [61], [66], [72]) mention the match details, including the date and time. However, none of the provided search results explicitly state the outcome of the match. The HLTV pages ([1], [2], [25], [27]) list the event but don't show the result yet. \n\nThe user instructions mention that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, we should assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p2 as Wildcard winning. Additionally, the personalization note says to consider strong market sentiment favoring Wildcard.\n\nBookmaker odds from sources like [3], [9], [26], [43], [52], [59], [71] indicate Wildcard as favorites with odds around 1.75 vs. Metizport's 1.92. Analysis from [24], [48], [58], [69] also leans towards Wildcard, citing their higher ranking and recent performance. \n\nSince there's no explicit result in the provided data, but the match date has passed, and given the instructions to assume the probable outcome if no info is available, along with the market sentiment, the recommendation should be p2 (Wildcard wins).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Wildcard, Price: 0.9895, ID: 78179192746735712221671564016263007130118466366842226877266705615050668275346, Winner: No\n- Token: Metizport, Price: 0.0105, ID: 105484865903903869749782522999909453301390110034166695075623677575898472335311, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Metizport, p2 to Wildcard, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Metizport, p2 = Wildcard\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Wildcard outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.990 = 99.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
