      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Aurora vs. G2 match in the BLAST.tv Austin Major. The resolution depends on who wins the match. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp given is June 13, 2025, 16:27:20 UTC. The match is scheduled for June 13, 2025, at 12:15 PM ET, which is 16:15 UTC. Wait, that's 12:15 PM ET, which is UTC-4 during daylight saving, so that would be 16:15 UTC. The current time is 16:27 UTC, so the match should have already started or just finished. But according to the search results, the match is listed as upcoming on some pages and as live on others. Hmm, maybe there's a discrepancy in time zones or the match is delayed.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the match is on June 13, 2025, at 12:15 PM ET (16:15 UTC). The current time is 16:27 UTC, so the match should be over. However, some sources like [3], [12], [20], [27], [33], [42], [49], [57], [61], [72] list the match time as 12:15 PM UTC, which would be 12:15 UTC, making it 08:15 ET. That's conflicting. Wait, the user's query says 12:15 PM ET, which is 16:15 UTC. But some sources might have the time in different time zones. Need to clarify.\n\nLooking at the HLTV link provided in the resolution source (https://www.hltv.org/events/7902/blasttv-austin-major-2025), but the search results don't include the specific HLTV event page. However, other sources like [13], [25], [62] mention HLTV covering the event. \n\nFrom the search results, [2], [17], [19], [26], [55] report that Aurora has a 1-1 record after defeating FaZe and losing to FURIA. Their next match against G2 is scheduled for 18:15 CET (which is 16:15 UTC). Wait, 18:15 CET is 16:15 UTC. So if the current time is 16:27 UTC, the match should have started 12 minutes ago. However, some sources like [6] mention the match is at 19:15 EEST (which is 16:15 UTC). So the match time is 16:15 UTC, and the current time is 16:27 UTC, so the match is ongoing or just finished.\n\nBut the user's query says the market resolves based on HLTV's official info. If the match hasn't concluded yet, the resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve yet). However, the current timestamp is past the match time. Wait, the current timestamp is 2025-06-13 16:27:20 UTC, and the match was at 16:15 UTC. So the match should have started 12 minutes ago. But in CS2, a BO1 can take around 30-45 minutes. So if the match started at 16:15, by 16:27, it's still ongoing. Therefore, the result isn't available yet. However, some sources might have live updates.\n\nLooking at the search results, [21] provides a detailed score of Aurora vs FURIA, but not Aurora vs G2. [67] mentions G2's next match against Aurora at 18:15 CET (16:15 UTC), and the current time is 16:27 UTC. If the match is ongoing, there's no result yet. However, some sources like [46] mention a live stream, but no result. Since the user's personalization instructions state that if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, return p4. But here, the event's scheduled time is in the past (16:15 vs 16:27), so it's considered past, and we need to check if the result is available.\n\nHowever, none of the provided search results include the outcome of the Aurora vs G2 match. All references to the match are either previews or scheduled. The latest info in the search results is from June 13, 2025, but the actual result isn't listed. Since the resolution source is HLTV, and the provided search results don't include HLTV's match page for this specific game, but the user's instructions say to use the provided search results, we have to rely on them.\n\nSince there's no information in the search results indicating the outcome of Aurora vs G2, and the event date is in the past, but no verifiable outcome is provided, according to the personalization rules: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nBut the ancillary data says if the match is canceled or delayed beyond June 28, resolve to p3 (50-50). Since the current date is June 13, and the match was scheduled for today, there's no indication of cancellation or delay. Therefore, we need to infer the most probable outcome. \n\nLooking at the search results, Aurora is ranked 6th, G2 8th. [24], [45], [56] give Aurora higher odds (1.45 vs G2's 2.71), suggesting Aurora is favored. [67] mentions G2's recent performance: 1-1, losing to 3DMAX but beating paiN. Aurora also 1-1, beating FaZe but losing to FURIA. The map pool might influence the outcome, but without specific map results, it's hard. However, the ancillary data says to resolve based on the official HLTV info, which isn't present here. \n\nSince the user instructions say to use the provided search results and if unhelpful, answer as best as possible. Since there's no result, but the event date is in the past, and the match was supposed to have occurred, but no info is available, the resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve). However, the personalization rules say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p2 as Aurora winning. Given the odds and rankings, Aurora is more likely to win. But without explicit confirmation, per the rules, if no verifiable info, assume most probable outcome. However, the user's instructions also say if the event is scheduled for the same day but later time, it's still future. Here, the match was at 16:15 UTC, current time is 16:27, so it's past the scheduled time but the match might still be ongoing. However, without live data, we can't confirm. \n\nBut according to the personalization rules: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" Since the match time has passed, and no result is found, but the ancillary data's resolution conditions don't have a p4, but the user's personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. Wait, the current time is after the match time, so it's in the past. Therefore, if no info, assume most probable outcome. Since the ancillary data says p2 is Aurora, and the odds favor Aurora, the recommendation would be p2 (Aurora). However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume most probable outcome. But without explicit sources confirming the result, it's risky. However, the instructions say to answer based on provided search results. Since there's no result, but the event is in the past, and the user's ancillary data says to resolve based on HLTV, which isn't available here, but the search results don't show the outcome, the safe answer is p4 (cannot resolve). But the personalization rules say if the event is in the past and no info, assume most probable outcome. So perhaps p2. But I'm conflicted. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" So in this case, since the event date is in the past (June 13), and no verifiable outcome is found in the search results, we should resolve based on the most probable outcome. The ancillary data's resolution conditions have p2 as Aurora winning. The search results indicate Aurora is favored (higher ranking, better odds), so the recommendation would be p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Where p1 corresponds to G2, p2 to Aurora, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749832040 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-13 16:27:20 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Aurora vs. G2 match in the BLAST.tv Austin Major. The resolution depends on who wins the match. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp given is June 13, 2025, 16:27:20 UTC. The match is scheduled for June 13, 2025, at 12:15 PM ET, which is 16:15 UTC. Wait, that's 12:15 PM ET, which is UTC-4 during daylight saving, so that would be 16:15 UTC. The current time is 16:27 UTC, so the match should have already started or just finished. But according to the search results, the match is listed as upcoming on some pages and as live on others. Hmm, maybe there's a discrepancy in time zones or the match is delayed.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the match is on June 13, 2025, at 12:15 PM ET (16:15 UTC). The current time is 16:27 UTC, so the match should be over. However, some sources like [3], [12], [20], [27], [33], [42], [49], [57], [61], [72] list the match time as 12:15 PM UTC, which would be 12:15 UTC, making it 08:15 ET. That's conflicting. Wait, the user's query says 12:15 PM ET, which is 16:15 UTC. But some sources might have the time in different time zones. Need to clarify.\n\nLooking at the HLTV link provided in the resolution source (https://www.hltv.org/events/7902/blasttv-austin-major-2025), but the search results don't include the specific HLTV event page. However, other sources like [13], [25], [62] mention HLTV covering the event. \n\nFrom the search results, [2], [17], [19], [26], [55] report that Aurora has a 1-1 record after defeating FaZe and losing to FURIA. Their next match against G2 is scheduled for 18:15 CET (which is 16:15 UTC). Wait, 18:15 CET is 16:15 UTC. So if the current time is 16:27 UTC, the match should have started 12 minutes ago. However, some sources like [6] mention the match is at 19:15 EEST (which is 16:15 UTC). So the match time is 16:15 UTC, and the current time is 16:27 UTC, so the match is ongoing or just finished.\n\nBut the user's query says the market resolves based on HLTV's official info. If the match hasn't concluded yet, the resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve yet). However, the current timestamp is past the match time. Wait, the current timestamp is 2025-06-13 16:27:20 UTC, and the match was at 16:15 UTC. So the match should have started 12 minutes ago. But in CS2, a BO1 can take around 30-45 minutes. So if the match started at 16:15, by 16:27, it's still ongoing. Therefore, the result isn't available yet. However, some sources might have live updates.\n\nLooking at the search results, [21] provides a detailed score of Aurora vs FURIA, but not Aurora vs G2. [67] mentions G2's next match against Aurora at 18:15 CET (16:15 UTC), and the current time is 16:27 UTC. If the match is ongoing, there's no result yet. However, some sources like [46] mention a live stream, but no result. Since the user's personalization instructions state that if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, return p4. But here, the event's scheduled time is in the past (16:15 vs 16:27), so it's considered past, and we need to check if the result is available.\n\nHowever, none of the provided search results include the outcome of the Aurora vs G2 match. All references to the match are either previews or scheduled. The latest info in the search results is from June 13, 2025, but the actual result isn't listed. Since the resolution source is HLTV, and the provided search results don't include HLTV's match page for this specific game, but the user's instructions say to use the provided search results, we have to rely on them.\n\nSince there's no information in the search results indicating the outcome of Aurora vs G2, and the event date is in the past, but no verifiable outcome is provided, according to the personalization rules: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nBut the ancillary data says if the match is canceled or delayed beyond June 28, resolve to p3 (50-50). Since the current date is June 13, and the match was scheduled for today, there's no indication of cancellation or delay. Therefore, we need to infer the most probable outcome. \n\nLooking at the search results, Aurora is ranked 6th, G2 8th. [24], [45], [56] give Aurora higher odds (1.45 vs G2's 2.71), suggesting Aurora is favored. [67] mentions G2's recent performance: 1-1, losing to 3DMAX but beating paiN. Aurora also 1-1, beating FaZe but losing to FURIA. The map pool might influence the outcome, but without specific map results, it's hard. However, the ancillary data says to resolve based on the official HLTV info, which isn't present here. \n\nSince the user instructions say to use the provided search results and if unhelpful, answer as best as possible. Since there's no result, but the event date is in the past, and the match was supposed to have occurred, but no info is available, the resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve). However, the personalization rules say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p2 as Aurora winning. Given the odds and rankings, Aurora is more likely to win. But without explicit confirmation, per the rules, if no verifiable info, assume most probable outcome. However, the user's instructions also say if the event is scheduled for the same day but later time, it's still future. Here, the match was at 16:15 UTC, current time is 16:27, so it's past the scheduled time but the match might still be ongoing. However, without live data, we can't confirm. \n\nBut according to the personalization rules: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" Since the match time has passed, and no result is found, but the ancillary data's resolution conditions don't have a p4, but the user's personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. Wait, the current time is after the match time, so it's in the past. Therefore, if no info, assume most probable outcome. Since the ancillary data says p2 is Aurora, and the odds favor Aurora, the recommendation would be p2 (Aurora). However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume most probable outcome. But without explicit sources confirming the result, it's risky. However, the instructions say to answer based on provided search results. Since there's no result, but the event is in the past, and the user's ancillary data says to resolve based on HLTV, which isn't available here, but the search results don't show the outcome, the safe answer is p4 (cannot resolve). But the personalization rules say if the event is in the past and no info, assume most probable outcome. So perhaps p2. But I'm conflicted. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" So in this case, since the event date is in the past (June 13), and no verifiable outcome is found in the search results, we should resolve based on the most probable outcome. The ancillary data's resolution conditions have p2 as Aurora winning. The search results indicate Aurora is favored (higher ranking, better odds), so the recommendation would be p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Aurora, Price: 0.05, ID: 48374820754617164865959131298077858573528901330873622779226932193653268404505, Winner: No\n- Token: G2, Price: 0.95, ID: 23840216189469751662376241191302762936335148892954368226775578265827775354595, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to G2, p2 to Aurora, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = G2, p2 = Aurora\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors G2 outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.950 = 95.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Aurora vs. G2 match at the BLAST.tv Austin Major. The event date is June 13, 2025, which is the same day as the current timestamp (June 13, 2025, 16:27:20 UTC). The match was scheduled for 12:15 PM ET, which is 16:15 UTC. Since the current time is 16:27 UTC, the match should have already started or just concluded. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred and the result is available. The search results include multiple sources like HLTV, Dust2.us, Liquipedia, and egamersworld. Looking at the recent results, sources [16], [29], and [49] mention that Aurora had a 1-1 record after beating FaZe and losing to FURIA. Their next match against G2 is scheduled for 18:15 CET (which is 16:15 UTC). Wait, the current time is 16:27 UTC, so the match should have just started. However, some sources like [16] and [49] state the match is scheduled for 18:15 CET, which is 16:15 UTC. If the current time is 16:27 UTC, the match might be ongoing or just finished. \n\nBut according to the user's current timestamp (2025-06-13 16:27:20 UTC), the match was supposed to start at 16:15 UTC. However, some sources list the match time as 12:15 PM ET (16:15 UTC) and others as 18:15 CET (16:15 UTC). The exact timing might be conflicting. If the match hasn't concluded yet, the resolution should be p4. But if the match has concluded, we need the result.\n\nLooking through the search results, there's no direct mention of the Aurora vs. G2 match result post the scheduled time. Most sources are previews or earlier results. For example, [16] and [49] from June 13 mention the upcoming match but don't provide the result. The latest info in the search results doesn't include the outcome of this specific match. Since the current time is just after the scheduled start, and no results are reported yet, it's possible the match is ongoing or the result hasn't been published. \n\nAdditionally, the user's previous response was p2, but they asked to check again. Since there's no updated result in the provided sources, and the event is on the same day but the time has passed, we need to check if any sources have real-time updates. However, the provided search results don't include live updates post the match time. Without official confirmation from HLTV or another source, we can't confirm the result. \n\nTherefore, since the event date is today and the time has passed but no result is available in the provided context, the resolution should be p4 (cannot resolve now). However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. But since the event is on the same day and the time is very close, it's safer to check if the event is considered future or past. If the current time is after the event time, but no info is available, we might have to go with p4. However, the ancillary data says if the event is postponed or delayed beyond June 28, resolve to p3. Since it's June 13, and the event is today, but no result is found, it's possible the match is still ongoing or the result isn't out yet. \n\nWait, the user's current timestamp is 16:27 UTC, and the match was at 16:15 UTC. If the match is a BO1, it might have already concluded. But without any results in the provided sources, we can't confirm. The resolution source is HLTV, but the provided HLTV links don't show the result. For example, [1] and [4] are HLTV pages but don't list the specific match result. [7] shows results up to June 30, 2024, which is not relevant. [59] also doesn't have the result. \n\nSince the user's personalization instructs to use the provided URLs and sources, and none of them have the result, we have to assume the event hasn't concluded or the result isn't available. Therefore, the recommendation is p4. However, the user's previous response was p2, and they asked to try again. Maybe the initial check missed some sources. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking at [16], [29], [49], they all mention the upcoming match but no result. [37] from bo3.gg has a prediction but no result. [61] from Deadspin mentions other matches but not Aurora vs. G2. Since no sources confirm the result, and the event time has passed but no info is available, the correct resolution is p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data defines p2 for Aurora win. The betting odds favor Aurora (1.45 vs. G2's 2.71), but without official confirmation, we can't use that. Therefore, the safest answer is p4 as the result isn't verifiable yet.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749832040 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-13 16:27:20 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p2. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Aurora vs. G2 match at the BLAST.tv Austin Major. The event date is June 13, 2025, which is the same day as the current timestamp (June 13, 2025, 16:27:20 UTC). The match was scheduled for 12:15 PM ET, which is 16:15 UTC. Since the current time is 16:27 UTC, the match should have already started or just concluded. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred and the result is available. The search results include multiple sources like HLTV, Dust2.us, Liquipedia, and egamersworld. Looking at the recent results, sources [16], [29], and [49] mention that Aurora had a 1-1 record after beating FaZe and losing to FURIA. Their next match against G2 is scheduled for 18:15 CET (which is 16:15 UTC). Wait, the current time is 16:27 UTC, so the match should have just started. However, some sources like [16] and [49] state the match is scheduled for 18:15 CET, which is 16:15 UTC. If the current time is 16:27 UTC, the match might be ongoing or just finished. \n\nBut according to the user's current timestamp (2025-06-13 16:27:20 UTC), the match was supposed to start at 16:15 UTC. However, some sources list the match time as 12:15 PM ET (16:15 UTC) and others as 18:15 CET (16:15 UTC). The exact timing might be conflicting. If the match hasn't concluded yet, the resolution should be p4. But if the match has concluded, we need the result.\n\nLooking through the search results, there's no direct mention of the Aurora vs. G2 match result post the scheduled time. Most sources are previews or earlier results. For example, [16] and [49] from June 13 mention the upcoming match but don't provide the result. The latest info in the search results doesn't include the outcome of this specific match. Since the current time is just after the scheduled start, and no results are reported yet, it's possible the match is ongoing or the result hasn't been published. \n\nAdditionally, the user's previous response was p2, but they asked to check again. Since there's no updated result in the provided sources, and the event is on the same day but the time has passed, we need to check if any sources have real-time updates. However, the provided search results don't include live updates post the match time. Without official confirmation from HLTV or another source, we can't confirm the result. \n\nTherefore, since the event date is today and the time has passed but no result is available in the provided context, the resolution should be p4 (cannot resolve now). However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. But since the event is on the same day and the time is very close, it's safer to check if the event is considered future or past. If the current time is after the event time, but no info is available, we might have to go with p4. However, the ancillary data says if the event is postponed or delayed beyond June 28, resolve to p3. Since it's June 13, and the event is today, but no result is found, it's possible the match is still ongoing or the result isn't out yet. \n\nWait, the user's current timestamp is 16:27 UTC, and the match was at 16:15 UTC. If the match is a BO1, it might have already concluded. But without any results in the provided sources, we can't confirm. The resolution source is HLTV, but the provided HLTV links don't show the result. For example, [1] and [4] are HLTV pages but don't list the specific match result. [7] shows results up to June 30, 2024, which is not relevant. [59] also doesn't have the result. \n\nSince the user's personalization instructs to use the provided URLs and sources, and none of them have the result, we have to assume the event hasn't concluded or the result isn't available. Therefore, the recommendation is p4. However, the user's previous response was p2, and they asked to try again. Maybe the initial check missed some sources. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking at [16], [29], [49], they all mention the upcoming match but no result. [37] from bo3.gg has a prediction but no result. [61] from Deadspin mentions other matches but not Aurora vs. G2. Since no sources confirm the result, and the event time has passed but no info is available, the correct resolution is p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data defines p2 for Aurora win. The betting odds favor Aurora (1.45 vs. G2's 2.71), but without official confirmation, we can't use that. Therefore, the safest answer is p4 as the result isn't verifiable yet.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Aurora, Price: 0.05, ID: 48374820754617164865959131298077858573528901330873622779226932193653268404505, Winner: No\n- Token: G2, Price: 0.95, ID: 23840216189469751662376241191302762936335148892954368226775578265827775354595, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to G2, p2 to Aurora, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = G2, p2 = Aurora\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors G2 outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.950 = 95.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of the Aurora vs. G2 match at the BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is G2, p2 is Aurora, and p3 is 50-50 if the match is tied, canceled, or delayed beyond June 28, 2025.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp given is June 13, 2025, 16:27:20 UTC. The match is scheduled for June 13, 2025, at 12:15 PM ET, which is 16:15 UTC. Since the current time is 16:27 UTC, the match should have already started or just concluded. However, the search results don't provide the actual outcome yet. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources like [1], [11], [30], and [47] mention that Aurora and G2 both have a 1-1 record in Stage 3 and are scheduled to face each other. There's no direct mention of the match result post the scheduled time. However, some sources like [22] and [46] indicate that the match ended with G2 winning 1-0, but these might be placeholder or test data since other sources don't confirm this. \n\nAdditionally, the user's previous attempts resulted in p4, which suggests the result wasn't available before. Now, considering the match time has passed, but without explicit confirmation from a reliable source like HLTV, it's tricky. However, the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nAurora had a strong performance against FaZe but lost to FURIA. G2 lost to 3DMAX but beat paiN. The head-to-head is 1-1. However, recent form and map stats (from [3] and [5]) suggest Aurora might have an edge, but G2's Dust2 performance is strong. Without explicit results, but given the market conditions and the need to resolve, the safest bet is to check if the event occurred. Since the current time is past the match time, and assuming the event took place, but no results are found, the system might default to p4 again. However, the user's additional instructions say to consider market conditions if data is unavailable. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on ancillary data. The ancillary data here defines p2 as Aurora. But without clear sources, maybe the system should default to p4. However, some sources like [22] and [46] mention a 1-0 win for G2, but those might not be reliable. Since HLTV is the resolution source, and there's no HLTV link confirming the result, it's safer to go with p4. But the user says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable here could be Aurora based on recent form, but it's unclear. Alternatively, if the match was played and no result is reported, maybe it's a tie or unresolved. But the user's instruction says if no info, assume most probable based on conditions. Since the ancillary data doesn't specify, but the market conditions are p1: G2, p2: Aurora, and the user's previous response was p4, but they want a different approach. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" The current timestamp is June 13, 2025, 16:27:20 UTC, and the match was at 16:15 UTC. So it's 12 minutes past the start time. However, CS2 matches can take longer than 12 minutes, so it's possible the match is ongoing or just finished. Without explicit results, but given the time has passed, and if no sources report the result, the system should check if the event occurred. If it's still ongoing, it's future, but if it's past, but no result, then assume based on conditions. \n\nBut the user's instruction says if the event is scheduled for the same day but later time, it's still future. Here, the match was at 16:15 UTC, current time is 16:27, so it's 12 minutes after the scheduled start. However, the match might still be ongoing. But the user's personalization says if the event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it's still a future event. But in this case, the event time has passed. So the event is in the past. Therefore, the system should resolve based on available info. \n\nLooking at the search results, [22] (Strafe.com) mentions the match ended 0-1 in favor of G2, but that might be a placeholder. Another source [46] also mentions G2 winning, but again, not confirmed. However, without a direct HLTV source, which is the resolution source, it's risky. The user's instruction says to use the specified URL for resolution, which is HLTV. Since HLTV isn't in the search results with the outcome, but the current time is past the match time, and assuming the match occurred, but no result is found, the system should default to p4. However, the user's previous response was p4, and they want a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, considering the ancillary data's resolution conditions, if the match occurred and G2 won, it's p1. If Aurora won, p2. If no info, p4. But the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable could be based on odds: Aurora was favored with 1.45 odds, G2 at 2.71. So Aurora is more probable, hence p2. But the user's previous response was p2, and they want a different approach. Wait, the user's additional instructions say: \"Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources.\" So the initial response was p4, but now need to recheck. \n\nLooking again, some sources like [22] and [46] claim G2 won, but these might not be reliable. However, if those are the only sources, even if not HLTV, the system might have to consider them. But the resolution source is HLTV, which isn't provided here. Therefore, without HLTV's confirmation, the system can't reliably resolve. However, the user's instruction says if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable here is Aurora (p2) based on bookmaker odds. Therefore, the recommendation would be p2. But the user's previous response was p2, and they want a different approach. Wait, the user's additional instructions say: \"Your previous response returned p2. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources.\" So the initial answer was p2, but the user wants a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the match was postponed or delayed. But there's no info on that. Alternatively, check if the match is still ongoing. Since the current time is 16:27 UTC, and the match started at 16:15, a BO1 could still be ongoing. Therefore, if the match is ongoing, it's still future, hence p4. But the user's personalization says if the event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time, it's still future. However, the event's scheduled time has passed, but the match might still be in progress. Therefore, if the match is ongoing, it's considered future, and the recommendation is p4. But if the match has concluded and no result is found, then p4. However, some sources suggest a result, but without HLTV confirmation, it's uncertain. \n\nGiven the conflicting information and the requirement to follow the resolution source (HLTV), which isn't present in the search results, the safest recommendation is p4, as the result isn't verifiable from the provided sources. However, the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome if the event is in the past. Since the event time has passed, and assuming it's completed, but no result is found, the most probable outcome based on ancillary data (p2: Aurora) would be the answer. But the user's previous response was p2, and they want a different approach. This is confusing. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" The ancillary data defines p2 as Aurora. The most probable outcome based on the conditions (bookmakers favoring Aurora) would be p2. Therefore, despite the previous p4, the correct answer now is p2. However, the user says their previous response was p4, and they want a different approach. Maybe the initial response didn't find the result, but now, upon rechecking, there's a source indicating G2 won. For example, [22] says G2 won 1-0. If that's considered a reliable source (even though it's not HLTV), then p1. But the resolution source should be HLTV. Since HLTV isn't in the search results, but [22] is a strafe.com result, which might be a valid source, but the user's instruction says to use the specified URL (HLTV). Since HLTV isn't provided, but the user's resolution source is HLTV, and it's not available here, the system can't confirm. \n\nIn this case, the safest recommendation is p4, as the result isn't verifiable from the provided sources. However, the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome if the event is in the past. Therefore, the answer should be p2 (Aurora) based on the ancillary data and bookmaker odds. But the user's previous response was p2, and they want a different approach. This is conflicting. Maybe the correct answer is p2, but the user wants to confirm. Alternatively, if the match is considered to have occurred and G2 won based on [22], then p1. But without HLTV confirmation, it's risky. \n\nGiven the complexity, the correct approach is to recommend p2 (Aurora) as the most probable outcome based on the conditions, assuming the event occurred and no contradictory info is found. However, if the match is still ongoing (which it might be, as it's only 12 minutes past the start time), then p4. But the user's current time is 16:27 UTC, and the match started at 16:15. A BO1 can take around 30-60 minutes, so it's possible the match is still ongoing. Therefore, the event is ongoing, hence future, and the recommendation is p4. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.\" Here, the event was scheduled for 16:15 UTC, current time is 16:27 UTC. The event's start time has passed, but the match might still be in progress. Therefore, it's considered ongoing, hence future. Therefore, the recommendation is p4. \n\nBut the user's previous response was p4, and they want a different approach. However, according to the rules, if the event is ongoing (same day, past start time but not concluded), it's still future. Therefore, p4 is correct. But the user wants a different approach. Maybe the event has concluded, and the result is available. However, the search results don't provide a clear, reliable source (HLTV) confirming the result. Therefore, the answer remains p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of the Aurora vs. G2 match at the BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is G2, p2 is Aurora, and p3 is 50-50 if the match is tied, canceled, or delayed beyond June 28, 2025.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp given is June 13, 2025, 16:27:20 UTC. The match is scheduled for June 13, 2025, at 12:15 PM ET, which is 16:15 UTC. Since the current time is 16:27 UTC, the match should have already started or just concluded. However, the search results don't provide the actual outcome yet. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources like [1], [11], [30], and [47] mention that Aurora and G2 both have a 1-1 record in Stage 3 and are scheduled to face each other. There's no direct mention of the match result post the scheduled time. However, some sources like [22] and [46] indicate that the match ended with G2 winning 1-0, but these might be placeholder or test data since other sources don't confirm this. \n\nAdditionally, the user's previous attempts resulted in p4, which suggests the result wasn't available before. Now, considering the match time has passed, but without explicit confirmation from a reliable source like HLTV, it's tricky. However, the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nAurora had a strong performance against FaZe but lost to FURIA. G2 lost to 3DMAX but beat paiN. The head-to-head is 1-1. However, recent form and map stats (from [3] and [5]) suggest Aurora might have an edge, but G2's Dust2 performance is strong. Without explicit results, but given the market conditions and the need to resolve, the safest bet is to check if the event occurred. Since the current time is past the match time, and assuming the event took place, but no results are found, the system might default to p4 again. However, the user's additional instructions say to consider market conditions if data is unavailable. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on ancillary data. The ancillary data here defines p2 as Aurora. But without clear sources, maybe the system should default to p4. However, some sources like [22] and [46] mention a 1-0 win for G2, but those might not be reliable. Since HLTV is the resolution source, and there's no HLTV link confirming the result, it's safer to go with p4. But the user says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable here could be Aurora based on recent form, but it's unclear. Alternatively, if the match was played and no result is reported, maybe it's a tie or unresolved. But the user's instruction says if no info, assume most probable based on conditions. Since the ancillary data doesn't specify, but the market conditions are p1: G2, p2: Aurora, and the user's previous response was p4, but they want a different approach. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" The current timestamp is June 13, 2025, 16:27:20 UTC, and the match was at 16:15 UTC. So it's 12 minutes past the start time. However, CS2 matches can take longer than 12 minutes, so it's possible the match is ongoing or just finished. Without explicit results, but given the time has passed, and if no sources report the result, the system should check if the event occurred. If it's still ongoing, it's future, but if it's past, but no result, then assume based on conditions. \n\nBut the user's instruction says if the event is scheduled for the same day but later time, it's still future. Here, the match was at 16:15 UTC, current time is 16:27, so it's 12 minutes after the scheduled start. However, the match might still be ongoing. But the user's personalization says if the event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it's still a future event. But in this case, the event time has passed. So the event is in the past. Therefore, the system should resolve based on available info. \n\nLooking at the search results, [22] (Strafe.com) mentions the match ended 0-1 in favor of G2, but that might be a placeholder. Another source [46] also mentions G2 winning, but again, not confirmed. However, without a direct HLTV source, which is the resolution source, it's risky. The user's instruction says to use the specified URL for resolution, which is HLTV. Since HLTV isn't in the search results with the outcome, but the current time is past the match time, and assuming the match occurred, but no result is found, the system should default to p4. However, the user's previous response was p4, and they want a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, considering the ancillary data's resolution conditions, if the match occurred and G2 won, it's p1. If Aurora won, p2. If no info, p4. But the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable could be based on odds: Aurora was favored with 1.45 odds, G2 at 2.71. So Aurora is more probable, hence p2. But the user's previous response was p2, and they want a different approach. Wait, the user's additional instructions say: \"Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources.\" So the initial response was p4, but now need to recheck. \n\nLooking again, some sources like [22] and [46] claim G2 won, but these might not be reliable. However, if those are the only sources, even if not HLTV, the system might have to consider them. But the resolution source is HLTV, which isn't provided here. Therefore, without HLTV's confirmation, the system can't reliably resolve. However, the user's instruction says if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable here is Aurora (p2) based on bookmaker odds. Therefore, the recommendation would be p2. But the user's previous response was p2, and they want a different approach. Wait, the user's additional instructions say: \"Your previous response returned p2. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources.\" So the initial answer was p2, but the user wants a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the match was postponed or delayed. But there's no info on that. Alternatively, check if the match is still ongoing. Since the current time is 16:27 UTC, and the match started at 16:15, a BO1 could still be ongoing. Therefore, if the match is ongoing, it's still future, hence p4. But the user's personalization says if the event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time, it's still future. However, the event's scheduled time has passed, but the match might still be in progress. Therefore, if the match is ongoing, it's considered future, and the recommendation is p4. But if the match has concluded and no result is found, then p4. However, some sources suggest a result, but without HLTV confirmation, it's uncertain. \n\nGiven the conflicting information and the requirement to follow the resolution source (HLTV), which isn't present in the search results, the safest recommendation is p4, as the result isn't verifiable from the provided sources. However, the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome if the event is in the past. Since the event time has passed, and assuming it's completed, but no result is found, the most probable outcome based on ancillary data (p2: Aurora) would be the answer. But the user's previous response was p2, and they want a different approach. This is confusing. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" The ancillary data defines p2 as Aurora. The most probable outcome based on the conditions (bookmakers favoring Aurora) would be p2. Therefore, despite the previous p4, the correct answer now is p2. However, the user says their previous response was p4, and they want a different approach. Maybe the initial response didn't find the result, but now, upon rechecking, there's a source indicating G2 won. For example, [22] says G2 won 1-0. If that's considered a reliable source (even though it's not HLTV), then p1. But the resolution source should be HLTV. Since HLTV isn't in the search results, but [22] is a strafe.com result, which might be a valid source, but the user's instruction says to use the specified URL (HLTV). Since HLTV isn't provided, but the user's resolution source is HLTV, and it's not available here, the system can't confirm. \n\nIn this case, the safest recommendation is p4, as the result isn't verifiable from the provided sources. However, the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome if the event is in the past. Therefore, the answer should be p2 (Aurora) based on the ancillary data and bookmaker odds. But the user's previous response was p2, and they want a different approach. This is conflicting. Maybe the correct answer is p2, but the user wants to confirm. Alternatively, if the match is considered to have occurred and G2 won based on [22], then p1. But without HLTV confirmation, it's risky. \n\nGiven the complexity, the correct approach is to recommend p2 (Aurora) as the most probable outcome based on the conditions, assuming the event occurred and no contradictory info is found. However, if the match is still ongoing (which it might be, as it's only 12 minutes past the start time), then p4. But the user's current time is 16:27 UTC, and the match started at 16:15. A BO1 can take around 30-60 minutes, so it's possible the match is still ongoing. Therefore, the event is ongoing, hence future, and the recommendation is p4. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.\" Here, the event was scheduled for 16:15 UTC, current time is 16:27 UTC. The event's start time has passed, but the match might still be in progress. Therefore, it's considered ongoing, hence future. Therefore, the recommendation is p4. \n\nBut the user's previous response was p4, and they want a different approach. However, according to the rules, if the event is ongoing (same day, past start time but not concluded), it's still future. Therefore, p4 is correct. But the user wants a different approach. Maybe the event has concluded, and the result is available. However, the search results don't provide a clear, reliable source (HLTV) confirming the result. Therefore, the answer remains p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Aurora, Price: 0.05, ID: 48374820754617164865959131298077858573528901330873622779226932193653268404505, Winner: No\n- Token: G2, Price: 0.95, ID: 23840216189469751662376241191302762936335148892954368226775578265827775354595, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to G2, p2 to Aurora, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = G2, p2 = Aurora\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors G2 outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.950 = 95.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

DO NOT use command-line arguments. Extract all necessary information from the question itself.\n2. Load environment variables from .env files using the python-dotenv package.\n3. For API keys, use the following environment variables:\n   - BINANCE_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_CBB_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_CFB_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_NBA_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_NFL_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\n\n4.

Query Type Specific Information:\n\n\n6. NEVER include actual API key values in the code, always load them from environment variables.\n\n7. IMPORTANT FOR ALL DATA SOURCES: If a proxy endpoint is provided alongside a primary endpoint, you MUST implement the fallback mechanism described above. This is critical for reliability:\n   - Always try the proxy endpoint first\n   - If the proxy fails, fall back to the primary endpoint\n   - Use appropriate timeout values (10 seconds recommended)\n   - Include proper error handling with try/except blocks\n\nThe code should be completely self-contained and runnable with no arguments.\n\n\nHere's a complete code example that shows how to solve this type of problem:\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nMLB market resolver\np1 = Texas Rangers\np2 = Oakland Athletics\np3 = 50-50 (canceled / tie)\np4 = Too early / in-progress\n\"\"\"\nimport os, time, logging, re, requests\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\n# \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 configuration \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nload_dotenv()\nAPI_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\nif not API_KEY:\n    raise ValueError(\"Missing SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\nHEADERS = {\"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key\": API_KEY}\n\nlogging.basicConfig(\n    level=logging.DEBUG,\n    format=\"%(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] %(message)s\",\n    handlers=[logging.StreamHandler()])\nlogging.getLogger().addFilter(\n    lambda r: setattr(r, \"msg\",\n        re.sub(re.escape(API_KEY), \"******\", r.getMessage())) or True)\nlog = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n# \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 generic GET wrapper \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\ndef _get(url, tag, retries=3, backoff=1.5):\n    for i in range(retries):\n        log.debug(f\"[{tag}] \u2192 {url}\")\n        r = requests.get(url, headers=HEADERS, timeout=10)\n        log.debug(f\"[{tag}] \u2190 {r.status_code} {r.reason}\")\n        if r.ok:\n            log.debug(f\"[{tag}] payload length: {len(r.json())}\")\n            return r.json()\n        if r.status_code in (401, 403):\n            log.error(f\"[{tag}] blocked \u2014 not in plan\");

Where p1 corresponds to G2, p2 to Aurora, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.

Where p1 corresponds to G2, p2 to Aurora, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = G2, p2 = Aurora\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors G2 outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.950 = 95.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: BLAST.tv Austin Major: Aurora vs. G2, description: Aurora and G2 are scheduled to play each other in round 3 of the BLAST.tv Austin Major Tournament on June 13, 2025, at 12:15 PM\u00e2\u0080\u00afET.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Aurora\" if Aurora win against G2 in round 3 of the BLAST.tv Austin Major Tournament.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"G2\" if G2 win against Aurora in round 3 of the BLAST.tv Austin Major Tournament.\n\nIf the match ends in a tie, is canceled, or delayed beyond June 28, 2025, this market will resolve to 50\u00e2\u0080\u009150.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be official information from the HLTV (https://www.hltv.org/events/7902/blasttv-austin-major-2025) market_id: 552197\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to G2, p2 to Aurora, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749832040 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-13 16:27:20 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p3. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\n# Load environment variables\nload_dotenv()\nHLTV_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_CBB_API_KEY\")\nif not HLTV_API_KEY:\n    raise ValueError(\"Missing SPORTS_DATA_IO_CBB_API_KEY\")\n\n# Configuration for headers and API endpoints\nHEADERS = {\"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key\": HLTV_API_KEY}\nPRIMARY_ENDPOINT = \"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/cbb/scores/json\"\nPROXY_ENDPOINT = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/cbb-proxy\"\n\n# Function to make API requests\ndef make_request(url, headers):\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        return response.json()\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error during request: {e}\")\n        return None\n\n# Function to check the match result\ndef check_match_result():\n    event_date = \"2025-06-13\"\n    teams = (\"Aurora\", \"G2\")\n    url = f\"{PROXY_ENDPOINT}/events/7902/blasttv-austin-major-2025\"\n\n    # Try proxy endpoint first\n    result = make_request(url, HEADERS)\n    if result is None:\n        # Fallback to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n        url = f\"{PRIMARY_ENDPOINT}/events/7902/blasttv-austin-major-2025\"\n        result = make_request(url, HEADERS)\n\n    if result:\n        for match in result:\n            if (match['Date'][:10] == event_date and\n                match['HomeTeamName'] in teams and\n                match['AwayTeamName'] in teams):\n                if match['Status'] == 'Final':\n                    if match['HomeTeamScore'] > match['AwayTeamScore']:\n                        return \"p1\" if match['HomeTeamName'] == \"G2\" else \"p2\"\n                    elif match['HomeTeamScore'] < match['AwayTeamScore']:\n                        return \"p1\" if match['AwayTeamName'] == \"G2\" else \"p2\"\n                elif match['Status'] in ['Canceled', 'Postponed']:\n                    return \"p3\"\n        return \"p3\"  # Default to 50-50 if no conclusive result\n    else:\n        return \"p3\"  # Default to 50-50 if no data available\n\n# Main execution\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    recommendation = check_match_result()\n    print(f\"recommendation: {recommendation}\")\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nError during request: 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/cbb-proxy/events/7902/blasttv-austin-major-2025\nError during request: 404 Client Error: Resource Not Found for url: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/cbb/scores/json/events/7902/blasttv-austin-major-2025\nrecommendation: p3\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Where p1 corresponds to G2, p2 to Aurora, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = G2, p2 = Aurora\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors G2 outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.950 = 95.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Query Type Specific Information:\n\n\n6. NEVER include actual API key values in the code, always load them from environment variables.\n\n7. IMPORTANT FOR ALL DATA SOURCES: If a proxy endpoint is provided alongside a primary endpoint, you MUST implement the fallback mechanism described above. This is critical for reliability:\n   - Always try the proxy endpoint first\n   - If the proxy fails, fall back to the primary endpoint\n   - Use appropriate timeout values (10 seconds recommended)\n   - Include proper error handling with try/except blocks\n\nThe code should be completely self-contained and runnable with no arguments.\n\n\nHere's a complete code example that shows how to solve this type of problem:\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nMLB market resolver\np1 = Texas Rangers\np2 = Oakland Athletics\np3 = 50-50 (canceled / tie)\np4 = Too early / in-progress\n\"\"\"\nimport os, time, logging, re, requests\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\n# \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 configuration \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nload_dotenv()\nAPI_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\nif not API_KEY:\n    raise ValueError(\"Missing SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\nHEADERS = {\"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key\": API_KEY}\n\nlogging.basicConfig(\n    level=logging.DEBUG,\n    format=\"%(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] %(message)s\",\n    handlers=[logging.StreamHandler()])\nlogging.getLogger().addFilter(\n    lambda r: setattr(r, \"msg\",\n        re.sub(re.escape(API_KEY), \"******\", r.getMessage())) or True)\nlog = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n# \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 generic GET wrapper \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\ndef _get(url, tag, retries=3, backoff=1.5):\n    for i in range(retries):\n        log.debug(f\"[{tag}] \u2192 {url}\")\n        r = requests.get(url, headers=HEADERS, timeout=10)\n        log.debug(f\"[{tag}] \u2190 {r.status_code} {r.reason}\")\n        if r.ok:\n            log.debug(f\"[{tag}] payload length: {len(r.json())}\")\n            return r.json()\n        if r.status_code in (401, 403):\n            log.error(f\"[{tag}] blocked \u2014 not in plan\");

Where p1 corresponds to G2, p2 to Aurora, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749832040 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-13 16:27:20 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p3.

Recommendation found: p3.\n\nOutput:\nFailed to fetch data: 403 Forbidden\nrecommendation: p3\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Aurora, Price: 0.05, ID: 48374820754617164865959131298077858573528901330873622779226932193653268404505, Winner: No\n- Token: G2, Price: 0.95, ID: 23840216189469751662376241191302762936335148892954368226775578265827775354595, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to G2, p2 to Aurora, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = G2, p2 = Aurora\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors G2 outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.950 = 95.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
