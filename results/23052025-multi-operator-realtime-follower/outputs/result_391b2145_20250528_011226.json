      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the SpaceX Starship Flight Test 9 Superheavy will explode, based on the given resolution conditions. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if the booster explodes from the start of fueling to 60 minutes after landing contact. If it doesn't happen by December 31, 2025, it's a \"No\". The resolution sources are SpaceX's official video and secondary reports if needed.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The provided timestamp is May 28, 2025. The launch is scheduled for May 27, 2025, which is just a day before. So the event has already occurred. The user is asking about the outcome of Flight 9.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's a lot of info. Let's go through them one by one. \n\nSearch result [1] is a YouTube video from May 24, 2025, stating that Flight 9's launch date is May 27. It mentions that Flight 8 had a fatal flaw fixed, and Flight 9 is set to launch. The FAA cleared them, and they've done spin prime testing. So Flight 9 did happen on May 27.\n\nResult [2] is SpaceX's updates page. It mentions Flight 8 on March 6, 2025, which ended in an explosion. Flight 8's Super Heavy booster was caught, but the upper stage had issues. However, this is about Flight 8, not 9.\n\nResult [3] is another YouTube video from May 25, 2025, discussing upgrades for Flight 9. They made design changes to both the upper stage and Super Heavy. This suggests improvements to prevent previous issues.\n\nResult [4] from March 10, 2025, talks about Raptor engine problems in Flight 8 causing an explosion. But Flight 9 has upgrades, so maybe those issues were addressed.\n\nResult [5] is a timeline from Fox9 on March 7, 2025, detailing Flight 8's failure. The booster was caught, but the upper stage exploded. Again, not directly about Flight 9.\n\nResult [6] from May 25, 2025, explains that Flight 8's explosion was due to a 'flash' in the engines. SpaceX fixed this for Flight 9 with hardware changes.\n\nResult [7] from March 11, 2025, analyzes Flight 8's failure, citing harmonic vibrations causing fuel line issues. Flight 9 would have fixes like improved insulation and venting.\n\nResult [9] is a YouTube video from May 26, 2025, detailing Flight 9's upgrades. The booster is reused (B14), with 29 of 33 engines from Flight 7. They added insulation to prevent ignition issues. The flight plan includes a splashdown instead of a catch, and they're testing engine configurations during landing. They disabled one engine intentionally to test backups.\n\nResult [10] from May 23, 2025, mentions the FAA allowed Flight 9, with the booster splashing down. The mishap report for Flight 8 was submitted, and the FAA approved the return to flight.\n\nResult [11] from May 24, 2025, states that Flight 9's booster will splash down, not be caught. They're testing higher angle of attack during descent and disabling an engine during landing. This is part of the experiment, so even if an engine fails, it's intentional, but does that count as an explosion?\n\nResult [12] from May 23, 2025, confirms FAA approval for Flight 9. The mishap report was accepted, so Flight 9 is cleared.\n\nResult [16] from May 27, 2025, says Flight 9 will have a splashdown in the Gulf. The booster is reused, and they're testing engine shutdowns. The article mentions that Flight 7's booster was caught, but Flight 9's will splash down. If the booster splashes down hard but doesn't explode, that's a \"No\". But if it explodes upon splashdown, it's a \"Yes\".\n\nResult [17] from CBS News on May 27, 2025, states that Flight 9 is launching that day. It mentions that after Flight 8's failure, fixes were made, including nitrogen purge systems and improved joints. The article also notes that during Flight 9's landing burn, one engine will be disabled to test backups. If the booster splashes down without exploding, even with a hard landing, it's a \"No\". But if the splashdown causes an explosion, it's a \"Yes\".\n\nResult [18] from May 26, 2025, mentions that Flight 9's booster will ditch into the Gulf, not attempting a catch. The hazard zones are expanded, suggesting possible risks, but no info on explosion.\n\nResult [19] from May 27, 2025, a video, says Flight 9 is hours away. The booster is reused, and they're testing controlled flips and engine shutdowns. The planned splashdown is part of the test. If the booster survives the splashdown without exploding, it's a \"No\".\n\nNow, looking for any reports of Flight 9's outcome. The latest info is from May 27, the launch day. None of the search results explicitly mention the outcome of Flight 9. However, the user's query is timestamped May 28, 2025, so the event has happened. Since the search results don't include post-launch data, I have to infer based on the planned mission.\n\nFlight 9's booster was planned to splash down in the Gulf. The test included intentional engine shutdowns. If the booster successfully performed a controlled splashdown without exploding, even if it's a hard landing, it would resolve to \"No\". However, if during splashdown or within 60 minutes after contact, it exploded, then \"Yes\".\n\nBut without explicit post-launch data in the provided search results, I have to rely on the planned procedures. The user's personalization instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines \"Yes\" if the booster explodes at any point from fueling to 60 minutes after landing.\n\nGiven that Flight 8 had explosions due to engine issues, and Flight 9 implemented fixes (insulation, nitrogen purge, etc.), it's probable that Flight 9's booster did not explode. The planned splashdown was a controlled test, and even with an engine disabled, if it landed without exploding, it's a \"No\". However, the sixth flight's booster exploded after splashdown, which would count as \"Yes\". But Flight 9's outcome isn't specified here.\n\nWait, result [6] mentions that Flight 8's explosion was due to a flash in the engines, and Flight 9 includes fixes. Result [9] says they added insulation to prevent ignition issues. Result [17] states that after Flight 8, they made improvements like nitrogen purge systems. So Flight 9's booster is less likely to explode.\n\nBut without explicit confirmation, according to the rules, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. Given the upgrades and successful FAA approval, the probable outcome is that the booster did not explode. Therefore, the resolution is \"No\" (p1).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The user wants to know if the SpaceX Starship Flight Test 9 Superheavy will explode, based on the given resolution conditions. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if the booster explodes from the start of fueling to 60 minutes after landing contact. If it doesn't happen by December 31, 2025, it's a \"No\". The resolution sources are SpaceX's official video and secondary reports if needed.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The provided timestamp is May 28, 2025. The launch is scheduled for May 27, 2025, which is just a day before. So the event has already occurred. The user is asking about the outcome of Flight 9.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's a lot of info. Let's go through them one by one. \n\nSearch result [1] is a YouTube video from May 24, 2025, stating that Flight 9's launch date is May 27. It mentions that Flight 8 had a fatal flaw fixed, and Flight 9 is set to launch. The FAA cleared them, and they've done spin prime testing. So Flight 9 did happen on May 27.\n\nResult [2] is SpaceX's updates page. It mentions Flight 8 on March 6, 2025, which ended in an explosion. Flight 8's Super Heavy booster was caught, but the upper stage had issues. However, this is about Flight 8, not 9.\n\nResult [3] is another YouTube video from May 25, 2025, discussing upgrades for Flight 9. They made design changes to both the upper stage and Super Heavy. This suggests improvements to prevent previous issues.\n\nResult [4] from March 10, 2025, talks about Raptor engine problems in Flight 8 causing an explosion. But Flight 9 has upgrades, so maybe those issues were addressed.\n\nResult [5] is a timeline from Fox9 on March 7, 2025, detailing Flight 8's failure. The booster was caught, but the upper stage exploded. Again, not directly about Flight 9.\n\nResult [6] from May 25, 2025, explains that Flight 8's explosion was due to a 'flash' in the engines. SpaceX fixed this for Flight 9 with hardware changes.\n\nResult [7] from March 11, 2025, analyzes Flight 8's failure, citing harmonic vibrations causing fuel line issues. Flight 9 would have fixes like improved insulation and venting.\n\nResult [9] is a YouTube video from May 26, 2025, detailing Flight 9's upgrades. The booster is reused (B14), with 29 of 33 engines from Flight 7. They added insulation to prevent ignition issues. The flight plan includes a splashdown instead of a catch, and they're testing engine configurations during landing. They disabled one engine intentionally to test backups.\n\nResult [10] from May 23, 2025, mentions the FAA allowed Flight 9, with the booster splashing down. The mishap report for Flight 8 was submitted, and the FAA approved the return to flight.\n\nResult [11] from May 24, 2025, states that Flight 9's booster will splash down, not be caught. They're testing higher angle of attack during descent and disabling an engine during landing. This is part of the experiment, so even if an engine fails, it's intentional, but does that count as an explosion?\n\nResult [12] from May 23, 2025, confirms FAA approval for Flight 9. The mishap report was accepted, so Flight 9 is cleared.\n\nResult [16] from May 27, 2025, says Flight 9 will have a splashdown in the Gulf. The booster is reused, and they're testing engine shutdowns. The article mentions that Flight 7's booster was caught, but Flight 9's will splash down. If the booster splashes down hard but doesn't explode, that's a \"No\". But if it explodes upon splashdown, it's a \"Yes\".\n\nResult [17] from CBS News on May 27, 2025, states that Flight 9 is launching that day. It mentions that after Flight 8's failure, fixes were made, including nitrogen purge systems and improved joints. The article also notes that during Flight 9's landing burn, one engine will be disabled to test backups. If the booster splashes down without exploding, even with a hard landing, it's a \"No\". But if the splashdown causes an explosion, it's a \"Yes\".\n\nResult [18] from May 26, 2025, mentions that Flight 9's booster will ditch into the Gulf, not attempting a catch. The hazard zones are expanded, suggesting possible risks, but no info on explosion.\n\nResult [19] from May 27, 2025, a video, says Flight 9 is hours away. The booster is reused, and they're testing controlled flips and engine shutdowns. The planned splashdown is part of the test. If the booster survives the splashdown without exploding, it's a \"No\".\n\nNow, looking for any reports of Flight 9's outcome. The latest info is from May 27, the launch day. None of the search results explicitly mention the outcome of Flight 9. However, the user's query is timestamped May 28, 2025, so the event has happened. Since the search results don't include post-launch data, I have to infer based on the planned mission.\n\nFlight 9's booster was planned to splash down in the Gulf.

The planned splashdown was a controlled test, and even with an engine disabled, if it landed without exploding, it's a \"No\". However, the sixth flight's booster exploded after splashdown, which would count as \"Yes\". But Flight 9's outcome isn't specified here.\n\nWait, result [6] mentions that Flight 8's explosion was due to a flash in the engines, and Flight 9 includes fixes. Result [9] says they added insulation to prevent ignition issues. Result [17] states that after Flight 8, they made improvements like nitrogen purge systems.

Given the upgrades and successful FAA approval, the probable outcome is that the booster did not explode. Therefore, the resolution is \"No\" (p1).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.9955, ID: 98390833777025712600385673000258533188571812386543249943277571250047783964639, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.0045, ID: 62124324898705186036935222291972895885426991910759072782523254470339425072023, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

The market resolution depends on whether the booster exploded from the start of fueling to 60 minutes after landing contact. The answer needs to be based on the provided search results and the ancillary data.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The personalization section says the current date is May 28, 2025. The launch was scheduled for May 27, 2025. So the flight has already happened.\n\nLooking at the search results, let's find information about Flight 9's outcome. \n\nSearch result [17] from space.com states that during Flight 9, the Super Heavy booster broke apart about 6 minutes and 20 seconds into the flight, just after beginning its landing burn. The article mentions, \"Confirmation that the booster did demise,\" and it's noted that the booster didn't make it through the landing burn. This indicates an explosion or destruction of the booster during the landing phase.\n\nAnother source, [18] from nasaspaceflight.com, discusses Flight 9's preparations but doesn't mention the outcome.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1748394563 Current Date and Time: 2025-05-28 01:09:23 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please re-evaluate the available data and consider the strong market sentiment favoring a 'Yes' outcome. Additional verification of post-launch outcomes is necessary to align the recommendation with market expectations.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the SpaceX Starship Flight Test 9 Super Heavy booster exploded during the test. The market resolution depends on whether the booster exploded from the start of fueling to 60 minutes after landing contact. The answer needs to be based on the provided search results and the ancillary data.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The personalization section says the current date is May 28, 2025. The launch was scheduled for May 27, 2025. So the flight has already happened.\n\nLooking at the search results, let's find information about Flight 9's outcome. \n\nSearch result [17] from space.com states that during Flight 9, the Super Heavy booster broke apart about 6 minutes and 20 seconds into the flight, just after beginning its landing burn. The article mentions, \"Confirmation that the booster did demise,\" and it's noted that the booster didn't make it through the landing burn. This indicates an explosion or destruction of the booster during the landing phase.\n\nAnother source, [18] from nasaspaceflight.com, discusses Flight 9's preparations but doesn't mention the outcome. However, [17] is explicit about the booster's breakup. \n\nThe user's note mentions that even a planned termination event counts as an explosion. The booster's destruction during landing, whether planned or not, would qualify. Since the booster broke apart during the landing burn, this meets the explosion definition provided.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence from [17], the answer should be \"Yes\" (p2). The other sources either discuss preparations or past flights, but [17] is the most direct and recent account of Flight 9's outcome.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.9955, ID: 98390833777025712600385673000258533188571812386543249943277571250047783964639, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.0045, ID: 62124324898705186036935222291972895885426991910759072782523254470339425072023, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
