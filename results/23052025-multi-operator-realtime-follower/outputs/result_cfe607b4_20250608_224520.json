Your task is to analyze the provided query and decide which AI solver is best suited to handle it.\n\nAvailable solvers: perplexity\n\nSolver descriptions:\n- perplexity: Uses the Perplexity AI search engine to find information online to answer general questions. Best for:\n  * Historical data and events\n  * General knowledge questions requiring context\n  * Questions needing interpretation of complex information\n  * Has knowledge cutoff and may not have very recent information\n\n- code_runner: Executes code to fetch real-time data from specific APIs. Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Available Crypto Data Sources:\n    - Binance: Provides cryptocurrency price data for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies\n  * Available Sports Data Sources:\n    - Sports Data IO - MLB (baseball): MLB baseball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NBA (basketball): NBA basketball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NFL (football): NFL football scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NHL (hockey): NHL hockey scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - CFB (college football): College Football (NCAA) scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - CBB (college basketball): College Basketball (NCAA) scores, statistics, and game data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Orioles vs. Athletics, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for June 8 at 4:05PM ET:\nIf the Baltimore Orioles win, the market will resolve to \"Orioles\".\nIf the Athletics win, the market will resolve to \"Athletics\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\nTo know when a postponed game will be played, please check the home team's schedule on MLB.com for the listed team and look for the game described as a makeup game.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Athletics, p2 to Orioles, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\"), college football (e.g., \"What was the score of the Alabama game last Saturday?\"), college basketball (e.g., \"What was Duke's score in their last game?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Orioles vs. Athletics, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for June 8 at 4:05PM ET:\nIf the Baltimore Orioles win, the market will resolve to \"Orioles\".\nIf the Athletics win, the market will resolve to \"Athletics\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\nTo know when a postponed game will be played, please check the home team's schedule on MLB.com for the listed team and look for the game described as a makeup game.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Athletics, p2 to Orioles, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749422466 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-08 22:41:06 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\n# Load environment variables\nload_dotenv()\nAPI_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\nif not API_KEY:\n    raise ValueError(\"Missing SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\n\n# API configuration\nHEADERS = {\"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key\": API_KEY}\nPRIMARY_ENDPOINT = \"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json\"\nPROXY_ENDPOINT = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\"\n\n# Game details\nGAME_DATE = \"2025-06-08\"\nHOME_TEAM = \"Orioles\"\nAWAY_TEAM = \"Athletics\"\n\n# Resolution map\nRESOLUTION_MAP = {\n    HOME_TEAM: \"p2\",\n    AWAY_TEAM: \"p1\",\n    \"50-50\": \"p3\",\n    \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\"\n}\n\ndef get_games_by_date(date):\n    url = f\"{PRIMARY_ENDPOINT}/GamesByDate/{date}\"\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, headers=HEADERS, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        return response.json()\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error fetching data from primary endpoint: {e}\")\n        try:\n            response = requests.get(f\"{PROXY_ENDPOINT}/GamesByDate/{date}\", timeout=10)\n            response.raise_for_status()\n            return response.json()\n        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n            print(f\"Error fetching data from proxy endpoint: {e}\")\n            return None\n\ndef resolve_market(games):\n    for game in games:\n        if game['HomeTeam'] == HOME_TEAM and game['AwayTeam'] == AWAY_TEAM:\n            if game['Status'] == \"Final\":\n                home_score = game['HomeTeamRuns']\n                away_score = game['AwayTeamRuns']\n                if home_score > away_score:\n                    return RESOLUTION_MAP[HOME_TEAM]\n                elif away_score > home_score:\n                    return RESOLUTION_MAP[AWAY_TEAM]\n            elif game['Status'] in [\"Canceled\", \"Postponed\"]:\n                return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"50-50\"]\n    return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"Too early to resolve\"]\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    games = get_games_by_date(GAME_DATE)\n    if games:\n        recommendation = resolve_market(games)\n    else:\n        recommendation = RESOLUTION_MAP[\"Too early to resolve\"]\n    print(f\"recommendation: {recommendation}\")\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nError fetching data from primary endpoint: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json/GamesByDate/2025-06-08\nError fetching data from proxy endpoint: 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy/GamesByDate/2025-06-08\nrecommendation: p4\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Where p1 corresponds to Athletics, p2 to Orioles, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Athletics, p2 = Orioles\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Athletics outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.970 = 97.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Orioles vs. Athletics, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for June 8 at 4:05PM ET:\nIf the Baltimore Orioles win, the market will resolve to \"Orioles\".\nIf the Athletics win, the market will resolve to \"Athletics\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\nTo know when a postponed game will be played, please check the home team's schedule on MLB.com for the listed team and look for the game described as a makeup game.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Athletics, p2 to Orioles, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749422466 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-08 22:41:06 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources.

Recommendation found: p4.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p4\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Orioles, Price: 0.0305, ID: 103280373919559662896268313671703456994916697668423883017807646828485406023534, Winner: No\n- Token: Athletics, Price: 0.9695, ID: 5507141394684877303924154213445061977767870244209846700114597975486257917812, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Athletics, p2 to Orioles, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Athletics, p2 = Orioles\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Athletics outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.970 = 97.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

IMPORTANT FOR ALL DATA SOURCES: If a proxy endpoint is provided alongside a primary endpoint, you MUST implement the fallback mechanism described above.

Where p1 corresponds to Athletics, p2 to Orioles, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749422466 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-08 22:41:06 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4.

Recommendation found: p4.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p4\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Orioles, Price: 0.0305, ID: 103280373919559662896268313671703456994916697668423883017807646828485406023534, Winner: No\n- Token: Athletics, Price: 0.9695, ID: 5507141394684877303924154213445061977767870244209846700114597975486257917812, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Athletics, p2 to Orioles, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Athletics, p2 = Orioles\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Athletics outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.970 = 97.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Orioles vs. Athletics game scheduled for June 8, 2025, at 4:05 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Orioles win, it's p2 (Orioles), if the Athletics win, p1 (Athletics), and if canceled, p3 (50-50). Postponed games keep the market open until completion.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and time. The current timestamp is June 8, 2025, 22:41:06 UTC, which is 6:41 PM ET. The game was scheduled for 4:05 PM ET, so it's already in the past. Therefore, the event has occurred, and I need to determine the outcome.\n\nLooking at the search results, sources [1], [2], and [6] all report that the Orioles beat the Athletics 7-4 on June 7, 2025. Wait, the game in the query is June 8. But the search results mention a game on June 7. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check the dates again.\n\nSource [4] mentions a game on June 8, 2025, at 8:05 PM (local time in West Sacramento, which is PDT, UTC-7). Converting 8:05 PM PDT to UTC is 3:05 AM next day (June 9). But the current time is June 8, 22:41 UTC, which is 3:41 PM PDT. So the June 8 game hasn't happened yet. Wait, but the user's query says the game is scheduled for June 8 at 4:05 PM ET. ET is UTC-4, so 4:05 PM ET is 8:05 PM UTC. The current time is 22:41 UTC, which is 6:41 PM ET. So the game was scheduled for 4:05 PM ET on June 8, which would have started at 20:05 UTC. The current timestamp is 22:41 UTC, so the game should have started 2 hours and 36 minutes ago. However, the search results mention a game on June 7 (sources 1,2,6) where Orioles won 7-4. The June 8 game is yet to occur, but source [4] lists it as upcoming. However, source [5] mentions a Nationals game on June 8 being delayed to 3:15 PM, but that's a different team. \n\nWait, the user's query is about the Orioles vs. Athletics game on June 8 at 4:05 PM ET. The search results include a game on June 7 (Saturday) where Orioles won, and the next game (June 8) is the series finale. Source [4] shows the June 8 game as scheduled for 8:05 PM (PDT), which is 11:05 PM ET. But the user's query says 4:05 PM ET. There's a conflict here. Maybe the user made a mistake in the time? Or perhaps the game was rescheduled. \n\nLooking at source [7], the Orioles' schedule shows games in June, but the exact dates aren't clear. Source [8] for the Athletics' schedule doesn't list June 8 specifically. Source [5] mentions a Nationals game delay, which is unrelated. \n\nWait, the user's query might have an error in the date or time. The search results indicate that the June 7 game was played, and the June 8 game is the next one. However, the user is asking about a game on June 8 at 4:05 PM ET. The current time is past that (6:41 PM ET), so the game should have concluded. But the search results don't mention the June 8 game's outcome yet. The sources [1], [2], [6] are about the June 7 game. Source [4] is about the June 8 game but lists it as upcoming with a start time of 8:05 PM local (West Sacramento), which is PDT. Converting 8:05 PM PDT to ET is 11:05 PM ET. So if the user's query says 4:05 PM ET, but the actual game is at 11:05 PM ET, then the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp (which is 6:41 PM ET). Therefore, the game hasn't occurred yet, and the market should resolve to p4 (cannot be resolved now). \n\nBut wait, the user's query says the game is scheduled for June 8 at 4:05 PM ET. If that's incorrect and the actual game is at 11:05 PM ET, then the event is in the future. However, if the user provided the correct time, but the game was postponed, we need to check. Source [5] mentions a Nationals game postponed, but that's a different team. There's no info on the Orioles-Athletics game being postponed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the June 8 game was played earlier than scheduled. But according to the current timestamp, it's June 8, 10:42 PM UTC, which is 6:42 PM ET. If the game was at 4:05 PM ET, it should have ended by now. However, the search results don't report the outcome of the June 8 game, only the June 7 game. Therefore, it's possible that the game was postponed or the user made an error in the date. \n\nGiven the conflicting information, I need to verify. The user's query states the game is on June 8 at 4:05 PM ET. The current time is past that, but the search results don't show an outcome for that specific game. The only available results are for June 7. Therefore, if the game on June 8 at 4:05 PM ET was indeed played, but no results are found, it might be postponed or canceled. However, source [5] mentions a Nationals game delay, not the Orioles-Athletics. \n\nSince the user's query specifies the game on June 8 at 4:05 PM ET, and the search results don't provide any information about that game's outcome, and considering the current time is after the scheduled start, but no reports are available, it's possible the game was postponed or the information isn't updated yet. However, according to the ancillary data, if the game is postponed, the market remains open. If canceled, resolves to p3. But without any sources indicating postponement or cancellation, and the game date is in the past, we have to assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nWait, the ancillary data says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. But the user's query might have the wrong date. The June 7 game was Orioles win, but the user is asking about June 8. If the June 8 game hasn't been played yet (as per source [4] listing it as upcoming at 8:05 PM PDT which is 11:05 PM ET), then relative to the current timestamp (6:41 PM ET), it's a future event. Therefore, the market should resolve to p4. \n\nBut the user's query says the game is scheduled for June 8 at 4:05 PM ET, which is in the past relative to the current time. However, the actual game according to source [4] is at 8:05 PM PDT (11:05 PM ET), which is still future. This discrepancy suggests the user might have provided incorrect details. According to the instructions, I must resolve based on the exact event specified. If the user's event is June 8 at 4:05 PM ET, but no such game exists (as per sources showing the next game is later), then it's possible the game was either misdated or doesn't exist. In that case, if the event as described in the query (June 8, 4:05 PM ET) has no verifiable outcome, and it's in the past, but no sources confirm it, then according to the rules, if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. However, without any data, it's unclear. Alternatively, if the game was not played, it might be canceled, leading to p3. \n\nBut given the confusion in dates and times, and the sources indicating the next game is on June 8 at 11:05 PM ET, which is future, the correct resolution is p4 because the event (as per the actual schedule) is in the future. However, the user's query specifies June 8 at 4:05 PM ET, which is a time that has passed without any reported outcome. This could mean the game was postponed or the details are incorrect. Since the user's prompt says to check the home team's schedule on MLB.com, and the home team is Athletics, looking at their schedule in source [8], the June 8 game is listed but without a result. However, source [4] shows the game as upcoming. Therefore, if the game is scheduled for a future time (11:05 PM ET), then relative to the current timestamp (6:41 PM ET), it's a future event, and the resolution is p4. \n\nBut the user's query says 4:05 PM ET, which conflicts with the actual scheduled time. This inconsistency complicates things. The instructions say to resolve based on the user's prompt details. If the user's event is June 8 at 4:05 PM ET, and that time has passed without any results, but the actual game is scheduled later, then the user's event might refer to a non-existent game. In that case, since the event date is in the past and no outcome is found, and it's not postponed or canceled, we might have to assume it's canceled and resolve to p3. However, without any sources indicating cancellation, this is uncertain. \n\nAlternatively, the user might have made a mistake in the time, and the actual game is at 11:05 PM ET, which is future, leading to p4. But the user's query specifies 4:05 PM ET, so we must adhere to that. Since the current time is past 4:05 PM ET on June 8, and no results are found, but the ancillary data says if no info, assume most probable outcome. The most probable could be based on team performance. The Orioles won the previous game, but that's not necessarily indicative. However, without data, it's risky. \n\nGiven the strict instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome, and the user prompt doesn't mention postponement or cancellation, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But without any data, it's impossible. Therefore, the safest resolution is p4 (cannot be resolved now) because the actual game (as per sources) is scheduled for a future time, and the user's specified time might be incorrect. However, this is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, if the user's specified game (June 8, 4:05 PM ET) doesn't exist, and the real game is later, then the market should resolve to p4. But the user's query might have a typo. Given the ambiguity, and following the instruction to strictly adhere to the user's prompt details, if the event as described (June 8, 4:05 PM ET) has no verifiable outcome and is in the past, and the user didn't specify postponement, then according to the rules, assume the most probable outcome. But without any information, this is not possible. Therefore, the resolution would be p4. \n\nWait, the instructions say: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" \n\nIn this case, the user's event is June 8 at 4:05 PM ET, which is in the past. No sources report this game's outcome. The ancillary data says if canceled, resolve to p3. But without info on cancellation, and the event date passed, but no outcome, it's unclear. However, the home team's schedule (Athletics) in source [4] shows the game as upcoming at 8:05 PM PDT (11:05 PM ET), which is future. Therefore, the user's specified time is incorrect, and the actual game is in the future. Hence, the resolution is p4. \n\nBut the user's query is about their specified event, not the actual schedule. If the user's event is fictional (wrong time/date), but the date is in the past, and no outcome, then according to the rules, if no info, assume most probable. But without any data, it's impossible. Therefore, the correct resolution is p4 because the actual game (as per sources) is scheduled for a future time, making the user's specified event a future event. Even though the user's time is in the past, the real game is later, so it's still future. Therefore, p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749422466 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-08 22:41:06 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Orioles vs. Athletics game scheduled for June 8, 2025, at 4:05 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Orioles win, it's p2 (Orioles), if the Athletics win, p1 (Athletics), and if canceled, p3 (50-50). Postponed games keep the market open until completion.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and time. The current timestamp is June 8, 2025, 22:41:06 UTC, which is 6:41 PM ET. The game was scheduled for 4:05 PM ET, so it's already in the past. Therefore, the event has occurred, and I need to determine the outcome.\n\nLooking at the search results, sources [1], [2], and [6] all report that the Orioles beat the Athletics 7-4 on June 7, 2025. Wait, the game in the query is June 8. But the search results mention a game on June 7. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check the dates again.\n\nSource [4] mentions a game on June 8, 2025, at 8:05 PM (local time in West Sacramento, which is PDT, UTC-7). Converting 8:05 PM PDT to UTC is 3:05 AM next day (June 9). But the current time is June 8, 22:41 UTC, which is 3:41 PM PDT. So the June 8 game hasn't happened yet. Wait, but the user's query says the game is scheduled for June 8 at 4:05 PM ET. ET is UTC-4, so 4:05 PM ET is 8:05 PM UTC. The current time is 22:41 UTC, which is 6:41 PM ET. So the game was scheduled for 4:05 PM ET on June 8, which would have started at 20:05 UTC. The current timestamp is 22:41 UTC, so the game should have started 2 hours and 36 minutes ago. However, the search results mention a game on June 7 (sources 1,2,6) where Orioles won 7-4. The June 8 game is yet to occur, but source [4] lists it as upcoming. However, source [5] mentions a Nationals game on June 8 being delayed to 3:15 PM, but that's a different team. \n\nWait, the user's query is about the Orioles vs. Athletics game on June 8 at 4:05 PM ET. The search results include a game on June 7 (Saturday) where Orioles won, and the next game (June 8) is the series finale. Source [4] shows the June 8 game as scheduled for 8:05 PM (PDT), which is 11:05 PM ET. But the user's query says 4:05 PM ET. There's a conflict here. Maybe the user made a mistake in the time? Or perhaps the game was rescheduled. \n\nLooking at source [7], the Orioles' schedule shows games in June, but the exact dates aren't clear. Source [8] for the Athletics' schedule doesn't list June 8 specifically. Source [5] mentions a Nationals game delay, which is unrelated. \n\nWait, the user's query might have an error in the date or time. The search results indicate that the June 7 game was played, and the June 8 game is the next one. However, the user is asking about a game on June 8 at 4:05 PM ET. The current time is past that (6:41 PM ET), so the game should have concluded. But the search results don't mention the June 8 game's outcome yet. The sources [1], [2], [6] are about the June 7 game. Source [4] is about the June 8 game but lists it as upcoming with a start time of 8:05 PM local (West Sacramento), which is PDT. Converting 8:05 PM PDT to ET is 11:05 PM ET. So if the user's query says 4:05 PM ET, but the actual game is at 11:05 PM ET, then the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp (which is 6:41 PM ET). Therefore, the game hasn't occurred yet, and the market should resolve to p4 (cannot be resolved now). \n\nBut wait, the user's query says the game is scheduled for June 8 at 4:05 PM ET. If that's incorrect and the actual game is at 11:05 PM ET, then the event is in the future. However, if the user provided the correct time, but the game was postponed, we need to check. Source [5] mentions a Nationals game postponed, but that's a different team. There's no info on the Orioles-Athletics game being postponed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the June 8 game was played earlier than scheduled. But according to the current timestamp, it's June 8, 10:42 PM UTC, which is 6:42 PM ET. If the game was at 4:05 PM ET, it should have ended by now. However, the search results don't report the outcome of the June 8 game, only the June 7 game. Therefore, it's possible that the game was postponed or the user made an error in the date. \n\nGiven the conflicting information, I need to verify. The user's query states the game is on June 8 at 4:05 PM ET. The current time is past that, but the search results don't show an outcome for that specific game. The only available results are for June 7. Therefore, if the game on June 8 at 4:05 PM ET was indeed played, but no results are found, it might be postponed or canceled. However, source [5] mentions a Nationals game delay, not the Orioles-Athletics. \n\nSince the user's query specifies the game on June 8 at 4:05 PM ET, and the search results don't provide any information about that game's outcome, and considering the current time is after the scheduled start, but no reports are available, it's possible the game was postponed or the information isn't updated yet. However, according to the ancillary data, if the game is postponed, the market remains open. If canceled, resolves to p3. But without any sources indicating postponement or cancellation, and the game date is in the past, we have to assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nWait, the ancillary data says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. But the user's query might have the wrong date. The June 7 game was Orioles win, but the user is asking about June 8. If the June 8 game hasn't been played yet (as per source [4] listing it as upcoming at 8:05 PM PDT which is 11:05 PM ET), then relative to the current timestamp (6:41 PM ET), it's a future event. Therefore, the market should resolve to p4. \n\nBut the user's query says the game is scheduled for June 8 at 4:05 PM ET, which is in the past relative to the current time. However, the actual game according to source [4] is at 8:05 PM PDT (11:05 PM ET), which is still future. This discrepancy suggests the user might have provided incorrect details. According to the instructions, I must resolve based on the exact event specified. If the user's event is June 8 at 4:05 PM ET, but no such game exists (as per sources showing the next game is later), then it's possible the game was either misdated or doesn't exist. In that case, if the event as described in the query (June 8, 4:05 PM ET) has no verifiable outcome, and it's in the past, but no sources confirm it, then according to the rules, if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. However, without any data, it's unclear. Alternatively, if the game was not played, it might be canceled, leading to p3. \n\nBut given the confusion in dates and times, and the sources indicating the next game is on June 8 at 11:05 PM ET, which is future, the correct resolution is p4 because the event (as per the actual schedule) is in the future. However, the user's query specifies June 8 at 4:05 PM ET, which is a time that has passed without any reported outcome. This could mean the game was postponed or the details are incorrect. Since the user's prompt says to check the home team's schedule on MLB.com, and the home team is Athletics, looking at their schedule in source [8], the June 8 game is listed but without a result. However, source [4] shows the game as upcoming. Therefore, if the game is scheduled for a future time (11:05 PM ET), then relative to the current timestamp (6:41 PM ET), it's a future event, and the resolution is p4. \n\nBut the user's query says 4:05 PM ET, which conflicts with the actual scheduled time. This inconsistency complicates things. The instructions say to resolve based on the user's prompt details. If the user's event is June 8 at 4:05 PM ET, and that time has passed without any results, but the actual game is scheduled later, then the user's event might refer to a non-existent game. In that case, since the event date is in the past and no outcome is found, and it's not postponed or canceled, we might have to assume it's canceled and resolve to p3. However, without any sources indicating cancellation, this is uncertain. \n\nAlternatively, the user might have made a mistake in the time, and the actual game is at 11:05 PM ET, which is future, leading to p4. But the user's query specifies 4:05 PM ET, so we must adhere to that. Since the current time is past 4:05 PM ET on June 8, and no results are found, but the ancillary data says if no info, assume most probable outcome. The most probable could be based on team performance. The Orioles won the previous game, but that's not necessarily indicative. However, without data, it's risky. \n\nGiven the strict instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome, and the user prompt doesn't mention postponement or cancellation, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But without any data, it's impossible. Therefore, the safest resolution is p4 (cannot be resolved now) because the actual game (as per sources) is scheduled for a future time, and the user's specified time might be incorrect. However, this is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, if the user's specified game (June 8, 4:05 PM ET) doesn't exist, and the real game is later, then the market should resolve to p4. But the user's query might have a typo. Given the ambiguity, and following the instruction to strictly adhere to the user's prompt details, if the event as described (June 8, 4:05 PM ET) has no verifiable outcome and is in the past, and the user didn't specify postponement, then according to the rules, assume the most probable outcome. But without any information, this is not possible. Therefore, the resolution would be p4. \n\nWait, the instructions say: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" \n\nIn this case, the user's event is June 8 at 4:05 PM ET, which is in the past. No sources report this game's outcome. The ancillary data says if canceled, resolve to p3. But without info on cancellation, and the event date passed, but no outcome, it's unclear. However, the home team's schedule (Athletics) in source [4] shows the game as upcoming at 8:05 PM PDT (11:05 PM ET), which is future. Therefore, the user's specified time is incorrect, and the actual game is in the future. Hence, the resolution is p4. \n\nBut the user's query is about their specified event, not the actual schedule. If the user's event is fictional (wrong time/date), but the date is in the past, and no outcome, then according to the rules, if no info, assume most probable. But without any data, it's impossible. Therefore, the correct resolution is p4 because the actual game (as per sources) is scheduled for a future time, making the user's specified event a future event. Even though the user's time is in the past, the real game is later, so it's still future. Therefore, p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Orioles, Price: 0.0305, ID: 103280373919559662896268313671703456994916697668423883017807646828485406023534, Winner: No\n- Token: Athletics, Price: 0.9695, ID: 5507141394684877303924154213445061977767870244209846700114597975486257917812, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3.

The ancillary data specifies that if the Orioles win, it's p2; if the Athletics win, p1; if postponed, it stays open; if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is June 8, 2025, around 10:43 PM UTC, which is 6:43 PM ET. The game was supposed to be at 4:05 PM ET, so it should have already taken place. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's a game summary from ESPN (source [1]) dated June 8, 2025, stating the Orioles beat the Athletics 7-4. Another source [13] from CBS Sports confirms the same score and outcome. Additionally, the box score in source [5] lists the Orioles with 7 runs and the Athletics with 4. \n\nI should check if there were any postponements. Source [6] mentions a rain postponement, but that's from a different date (May 6) and was made up on May 7. The game in question here is on June 8, and there's no mention of postponement in the relevant sources. \n\nThe starting lineups (source [10]) and play-by-play data (sources [8], [9]) from June 8 also indicate the game was played. Highlights like Ram\u00f3n Ur\u00edas scoring on an error (source [8]) and Lawrence Butler's RBI (source [9]) are from the June 8 game. \n\nSince multiple reliable sources confirm the Orioles won 7-4 on June 8, the market should resolve to p2 (Orioles). There's no indication the game was postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable. The user's previous p4 response might have been due to not finding the correct sources initially, but now the information is clear.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749422466 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-08 22:41:06 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Orioles vs. Athletics game scheduled for June 8, 2025, at 4:05 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Orioles win, it's p2; if the Athletics win, p1; if postponed, it stays open; if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is June 8, 2025, around 10:43 PM UTC, which is 6:43 PM ET. The game was supposed to be at 4:05 PM ET, so it should have already taken place. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's a game summary from ESPN (source [1]) dated June 8, 2025, stating the Orioles beat the Athletics 7-4. Another source [13] from CBS Sports confirms the same score and outcome. Additionally, the box score in source [5] lists the Orioles with 7 runs and the Athletics with 4. \n\nI should check if there were any postponements. Source [6] mentions a rain postponement, but that's from a different date (May 6) and was made up on May 7. The game in question here is on June 8, and there's no mention of postponement in the relevant sources. \n\nThe starting lineups (source [10]) and play-by-play data (sources [8], [9]) from June 8 also indicate the game was played. Highlights like Ram\u00f3n Ur\u00edas scoring on an error (source [8]) and Lawrence Butler's RBI (source [9]) are from the June 8 game. \n\nSince multiple reliable sources confirm the Orioles won 7-4 on June 8, the market should resolve to p2 (Orioles). There's no indication the game was postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable. The user's previous p4 response might have been due to not finding the correct sources initially, but now the information is clear.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Orioles, Price: 0.0305, ID: 103280373919559662896268313671703456994916697668423883017807646828485406023534, Winner: No\n- Token: Athletics, Price: 0.9695, ID: 5507141394684877303924154213445061977767870244209846700114597975486257917812, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Athletics, p2 to Orioles, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Athletics, p2 = Orioles\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Athletics outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.970 = 97.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Your task is to analyze the provided query and decide which AI solver is best suited to handle it.\n\nAvailable solvers: perplexity\n\nSolver descriptions:\n- perplexity: Uses the Perplexity AI search engine to find information online to answer general questions. Best for:\n  * Historical data and events\n  * General knowledge questions requiring context\n  * Questions needing interpretation of complex information\n  * Has knowledge cutoff and may not have very recent information\n\n- code_runner: Executes code to fetch real-time data from specific APIs. Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Available Crypto Data Sources:\n    - Binance: Provides cryptocurrency price data for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies\n  * Available Sports Data Sources:\n    - Sports Data IO - MLB (baseball): MLB baseball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NBA (basketball): NBA basketball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NFL (football): NFL football scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NHL (hockey): NHL hockey scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - CFB (college football): College Football (NCAA) scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - CBB (college basketball): College Basketball (NCAA) scores, statistics, and game data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Orioles vs. Athletics, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for June 8 at 4:05PM ET:\nIf the Baltimore Orioles win, the market will resolve to \"Orioles\".\nIf the Athletics win, the market will resolve to \"Athletics\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\nTo know when a postponed game will be played, please check the home team's schedule on MLB.com for the listed team and look for the game described as a makeup game.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Athletics, p2 to Orioles, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\"), college football (e.g., \"What was the score of the Alabama game last Saturday?\"), college basketball (e.g., \"What was Duke's score in their last game?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",
