      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the FaZe vs. MIBR match in the BLAST.tv Austin Major Stage 2. The resolution depends on who wins the match scheduled for June 10, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is MIBR, p2 is FaZe, and p3 is a 50-50 split if the match is tied, canceled, or delayed beyond June 28, 2025. The resolution source is HLTV's official information.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The provided current timestamp is June 10, 2025, 22:33:49 UTC. The match was scheduled for June 10, 2025, at 4:00 PM ET, which is 20:00 UTC. Since the current time is 22:33 UTC, the match should have already occurred. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the match. For example, result [18] states that FaZe lost to 3DMAX and will face MIBR in the last chance matches. However, the key is to find the actual outcome of the FaZe vs. MIBR match. \n\nResult [40] mentions that MIBR eliminated Falcons in a previous round. Result [41] from cs2grove.com provides a recap of Day 3, indicating that FaZe lost to 3DMAX and are now in the 2-2 bracket, needing to play MIBR. However, this doesn't confirm the result of their actual match.\n\nResult [60] is an article where s1mple comments on the upcoming match against MIBR, but it's dated June 10, 2025, and doesn't provide the result. \n\nResult [38] from Liquipedia's Stage 2 page doesn't list the specific match outcome. Similarly, other results like [13], [20], [28], [39], [45], [54], [62] provide match details but don't confirm the result. \n\nSince the current time is past the match's scheduled time, and there's no explicit mention of the result in the provided search results, I need to infer based on available data. However, the user's personalization instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nThe search results indicate that FaZe was struggling, losing to 3DMAX, while MIBR had an upset against Falcons. However, expert predictions (result [21], [36], [57]) heavily favor FaZe with around 70% probability. Bookmakers also favored FaZe. \n\nBut according to the rules, if no verifiable information is available, and the event date is past, we should assume the most probable outcome. However, the user's instructions also mention that if the event is scheduled for the same day but a later time, it's still considered future. Here, the match was at 20:00 UTC, and the current time is 22:33 UTC, so it's in the past. \n\nWait, the match was at 4:00 PM ET, which is 20:00 UTC. The current time is 22:33 UTC, so the match should have concluded. However, none of the search results explicitly state the outcome of FaZe vs. MIBR. The latest mention is from result [60], which is an article from June 10 discussing s1mple's comments before the match. \n\nSince there's no explicit result in the provided context, and the user's instructions say to resolve based on the most probable outcome if no info is available, but the event date is past. However, the user also specified to check if the event is in the future relative to the timestamp. Since the match was scheduled for June 10, 2025, 20:00 UTC, and the current timestamp is June 10, 2025, 22:33:49 UTC, the event has already occurred. \n\nBut without any sources confirming the result, the resolution should default to p4 (cannot resolve) if no info is available. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But the ancillary data says if the match is canceled or delayed beyond June 28, resolve to p3. Since the match was on June 10 and it's already past, but no result is found, perhaps it's considered unresolved. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nIn this case, the ancillary data's resolution conditions are p1: MIBR, p2: FaZe, p3: 50-50. Since the event date is past, and no verifiable outcome is found in the provided sources, we have to assume the most probable outcome. The experts and bookmakers favored FaZe, so the resolution would be p2 (FaZe). However, the user's instructions say to check if the event is in the future. Since the match time was 20:00 UTC and the current time is 22:33 UTC, it's in the past. But without any sources confirming the result, the correct resolution is p4 (cannot resolve). Wait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. Therefore, despite no sources, we have to go with the probable outcome, which is FaZe (p2). But the problem is that the provided search results don't include the actual result. However, the user's instructions say to use the provided search results. If the search results don't include the outcome, then we have to answer as best as possible. \n\nWait, the user's query includes the resolution source as HLTV. Checking the search results, result [12] is HLTV's coverage hub, but it doesn't list the specific match result. Result [15] is HLTV's matches page, but the provided content doesn't show the result. Since the provided context doesn't include the actual result from HLTV, and the event is past, but the user's instructions say to use the provided search results, and if they are unhelpful, answer as best as possible. \n\nIn this case, since there's no explicit result in the provided sources, but the event date is past, and the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome, the recommendation would be p2 (FaZe).

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749594829 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-10 22:33:49 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the FaZe vs. MIBR match in the BLAST.tv Austin Major Stage 2. The resolution depends on who wins the match scheduled for June 10, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is MIBR, p2 is FaZe, and p3 is a 50-50 split if the match is tied, canceled, or delayed beyond June 28, 2025. The resolution source is HLTV's official information.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The provided current timestamp is June 10, 2025, 22:33:49 UTC. The match was scheduled for June 10, 2025, at 4:00 PM ET, which is 20:00 UTC. Since the current time is 22:33 UTC, the match should have already occurred. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the match. For example, result [18] states that FaZe lost to 3DMAX and will face MIBR in the last chance matches. However, the key is to find the actual outcome of the FaZe vs. MIBR match. \n\nResult [40] mentions that MIBR eliminated Falcons in a previous round. Result [41] from cs2grove.com provides a recap of Day 3, indicating that FaZe lost to 3DMAX and are now in the 2-2 bracket, needing to play MIBR. However, this doesn't confirm the result of their actual match.\n\nResult [60] is an article where s1mple comments on the upcoming match against MIBR, but it's dated June 10, 2025, and doesn't provide the result. \n\nResult [38] from Liquipedia's Stage 2 page doesn't list the specific match outcome. Similarly, other results like [13], [20], [28], [39], [45], [54], [62] provide match details but don't confirm the result. \n\nSince the current time is past the match's scheduled time, and there's no explicit mention of the result in the provided search results, I need to infer based on available data. However, the user's personalization instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nThe search results indicate that FaZe was struggling, losing to 3DMAX, while MIBR had an upset against Falcons. However, expert predictions (result [21], [36], [57]) heavily favor FaZe with around 70% probability. Bookmakers also favored FaZe. \n\nBut according to the rules, if no verifiable information is available, and the event date is past, we should assume the most probable outcome. However, the user's instructions also mention that if the event is scheduled for the same day but a later time, it's still considered future. Here, the match was at 20:00 UTC, and the current time is 22:33 UTC, so it's in the past. \n\nWait, the match was at 4:00 PM ET, which is 20:00 UTC. The current time is 22:33 UTC, so the match should have concluded. However, none of the search results explicitly state the outcome of FaZe vs. MIBR. The latest mention is from result [60], which is an article from June 10 discussing s1mple's comments before the match. \n\nSince there's no explicit result in the provided context, and the user's instructions say to resolve based on the most probable outcome if no info is available, but the event date is past. However, the user also specified to check if the event is in the future relative to the timestamp. Since the match was scheduled for June 10, 2025, 20:00 UTC, and the current timestamp is June 10, 2025, 22:33:49 UTC, the event has already occurred. \n\nBut without any sources confirming the result, the resolution should default to p4 (cannot resolve) if no info is available. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But the ancillary data says if the match is canceled or delayed beyond June 28, resolve to p3. Since the match was on June 10 and it's already past, but no result is found, perhaps it's considered unresolved. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nIn this case, the ancillary data's resolution conditions are p1: MIBR, p2: FaZe, p3: 50-50. Since the event date is past, and no verifiable outcome is found in the provided sources, we have to assume the most probable outcome. The experts and bookmakers favored FaZe, so the resolution would be p2 (FaZe). However, the user's instructions say to check if the event is in the future. Since the match time was 20:00 UTC and the current time is 22:33 UTC, it's in the past. But without any sources confirming the result, the correct resolution is p4 (cannot resolve). Wait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. Therefore, despite no sources, we have to go with the probable outcome, which is FaZe (p2). But the problem is that the provided search results don't include the actual result. However, the user's instructions say to use the provided search results. If the search results don't include the outcome, then we have to answer as best as possible. \n\nWait, the user's query includes the resolution source as HLTV. Checking the search results, result [12] is HLTV's coverage hub, but it doesn't list the specific match result. Result [15] is HLTV's matches page, but the provided content doesn't show the result. Since the provided context doesn't include the actual result from HLTV, and the event is past, but the user's instructions say to use the provided search results, and if they are unhelpful, answer as best as possible. \n\nIn this case, since there's no explicit result in the provided sources, but the event date is past, and the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome, the recommendation would be p2 (FaZe). However, the user's personalization also mentions that if the event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time, it's still future. But in this case, the match time was 20:00 UTC, and the current time is 22:33 UTC, so it's past. Therefore, the event has occurred, but no result is found. According to the rules, if no info, assume the most probable outcome. Therefore, the recommendation is p2 (FaZe).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: FaZe, Price: 0.945, ID: 64248477172686912130569890540872155339920846463066324826767745931442732393929, Winner: No\n- Token: MIBR, Price: 0.055, ID: 56969870534109739759424743307383014204571137899897722205800344370550645370341, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to MIBR, p2 to FaZe, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = MIBR, p2 = FaZe\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors FaZe outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.945 = 94.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the FaZe vs. MIBR match at the BLAST.tv Austin Major Stage 2. The market resolves to \"FaZe\" if they win, \"MIBR\" if they win, and 50-50 if it's a tie, canceled, or delayed beyond June 28, 2025. The resolution source is HLTV.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp given is June 10, 2025, 22:33:49 UTC. The match was scheduled for June 10, 2025, at 4:00 PM ET, which is 8:00 PM UTC. Since the current time is 10:33 PM UTC, the match should have already occurred.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the match. For example, result [1] from egamersworld.com states the match is ongoing in a BO3 format. However, other sources like [2] and [8] from dust2.us provide detailed match info, including the maps (Nuke, Ancient, Anubis) and lineups. \n\nResult [11] from egamersworld.com reports that MIBR eliminated Falcons in a previous round, showing their recent form. Additionally, result [63] confirms that MIBR defeated Falcons in a tense overtime, which might indicate their current momentum.\n\nHowever, the critical information is the actual outcome of the FaZe vs. MIBR match. Result [30] is a YouTube video transcript describing a match where MIBR won against Falcons, but that's a different game. Result [50] from scores24.live provides a prediction, mentioning that MIBR pulled off a miracle against Falcons, but again, that's not the FaZe match.\n\nLooking at result [63], it's about MIBR eliminating Falcons, not FaZe. The key here is that none of the provided search results explicitly state the outcome of the FaZe vs. MIBR match. Some sources like [1], [2], [8], [10], [12], [18], [20], [26], [27], [36], [41], [44], [51], [52], [57], [64], and [65] discuss the upcoming or ongoing match but don't provide the result. \n\nSince the current time is past the match's scheduled time, but there's no explicit result in the provided data, I need to check if there's any indication of postponement or cancellation. The user's personalization instructions mention that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. However, the ancillary data specifies that the resolution source is HLTV. \n\nChecking result [60], which is HLTV's main page, there's no mention of the FaZe vs. MIBR result in the provided snippets. Similarly, result [61] is MIBR's team page on HLTV, but the latest matches listed don't include the FaZe match. \n\nGiven that the search results don't include the actual outcome and the resolution source (HLTV) isn't showing the result in the provided data, I might have to default to the conditions. However, the user's previous response was p2 (FaZe win), and they're asking to try again. \n\nWait, result [37] from scores24.live's prediction mentions that FaZe lost to 3DMAX and MIBR had a recent win. But predictions aren't results. Result [50] also is a prediction, not a result. \n\nSince there's no verifiable outcome in the provided sources and the event date is in the past, according to the user's instructions, if no outcome is available, and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The ancillary data defines p2 as FaZe winning. However, the user's previous response was p2, and they want a different approach. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"Your previous response returned p2. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\"\n\nSo, the assistant previously said FaZe won (p2), but the user wants a recheck. Since the provided search results don't have the actual result, and the match date is in the past, but no sources confirm the outcome, the resolution should default to p3 (50-50) if the outcome isn't verifiable. However, the market conditions say if the match is delayed beyond June 28, 2025, it's 50-50. Since the current date is June 10, 2025, and the match was on June 10, it's not delayed beyond June 28. Therefore, if no result is found, but the event occurred, and assuming it's not canceled or tied, but the data isn't available, perhaps the resolution is p3. However, the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The conditions in the ancillary data have p2 as FaZe winning. But without data, maybe it's p3. \n\nWait, the resolution conditions say if the match is canceled or delayed beyond June 28, resolve to 50-50. Since it's June 10, the match wasn't delayed beyond June 28, so that condition isn't met. If the match occurred but no result is found, perhaps it's a tie? But the match is a BO3, which can't end in a tie. So, if there's no result, but the match happened, and it's not reported, perhaps the resolution is p3. However, the user's instructions say if no verifiable info, answer as best as possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the match was played, and based on the most probable outcome. The bookmakers' odds in the search results (e.g., [1], [10], [18], [26], [41], [52], [65]) favor FaZe with odds around 1.42 vs. MIBR's 2.57. So, the probable outcome is FaZe winning. But the user's previous answer was p2, and they want a different approach. However, if the data doesn't show the result, but the match occurred, and the resolution source (HLTV) isn't providing the result in the given data, perhaps the correct answer is p3 because the result isn't verifiable. But the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThis is conflicting. The market's resolution conditions say if the match is canceled or delayed beyond June 28, resolve to 50-50. Since it's June 10, the delay condition isn't met. If the match was played but no result is found, it's unclear. However, the user's personalization says to consider the market conditions. The ancillary data's resolution source is HLTV, but in the provided search results, HLTV's page ([60], [61]) doesn't show the result. Therefore, without verifiable information, the resolution should be p3. But the user's instructions say if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The probable outcome based on bookmakers is FaZe (p2), but the user wants a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the match was not played, but the search results indicate it was scheduled. However, the current time is after the match time, so it should have occurred. Since there's no result in the provided data, and the resolution source isn't showing it, perhaps the match was canceled or the result isn't available, leading to p3. But the user's instructions say if the event occurred but no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThis is a bit of a dilemma. Given the conflicting instructions and lack of explicit result in the provided sources, the safest bet is to go with p3 (50-50) due to lack of verifiable information, even though the bookmakers favored FaZe. However, the user's previous answer was p2, and they want a different approach. Maybe the match was indeed played, and the result is available elsewhere, but not in the provided search results. Since the resolution source is HLTV, and the provided HLTV results don't include the match outcome, perhaps the correct answer is p3. \n\nBut wait, result [63] mentions MIBR's victory over Falcons, but not FaZe. There's no result here for FaZe vs. MIBR. Therefore, without explicit confirmation, the resolution should be p3. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The probable outcome is FaZe (p2), but since the user wants a different approach, maybe the assistant should consider that the data isn't available and default to p3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the match was played, and the result is in the search results but not explicitly stated. For example, result [45] from Liquipedia's Stage 2 page shows FaZe and MIBR in the standings but doesn't list the result. Similarly, result [35] and [54] about Stage 2 format don't have the result. \n\nGiven all this, the conclusion is that there's no verifiable result in the provided sources, so according to the user's instructions, if no info is available, and the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. The probable outcome based on bookmakers is FaZe (p2), but the user's previous answer was p2, and they want a different approach. However, without data contradicting that, perhaps the correct answer remains p2. Alternatively, maybe the match was not played, but that's unlikely as it's past the scheduled time. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" The conditions in the user prompt (ancillary data) have p2 as FaZe winning. Since there's no contradiction in the sources (they just don't report the result), the assumption is FaZe won. Therefore, the recommendation is p2 again. But the user says the previous response was p2 and wants a different approach. \n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the assistant made a mistake before. If the sources don't report the result, but the match occurred, and the resolution is based on HLTV, which isn't showing it here, perhaps the correct answer is p3. However, the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if no info. The bookmakers' odds in the search results heavily favor FaZe, so the probable outcome is p2. Therefore, despite the user's previous answer, the correct recommendation is p2. But the user is asking to try again, implying maybe the previous answer was incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the match was actually won by MIBR, but the search results don't show it. However, there's no evidence of that. The only MIBR win mentioned is against Falcons, not FaZe. \n\nGiven all this, I think the correct answer is p2 (FaZe) as the most probable outcome based on bookmakers and lack of contradictory info. Even though the user wants a different approach, the data doesn't support a different outcome. Therefore, the recommendation remains p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749594829 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-10 22:33:49 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p2. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the FaZe vs. MIBR match at the BLAST.tv Austin Major Stage 2. The market resolves to \"FaZe\" if they win, \"MIBR\" if they win, and 50-50 if it's a tie, canceled, or delayed beyond June 28, 2025. The resolution source is HLTV.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp given is June 10, 2025, 22:33:49 UTC. The match was scheduled for June 10, 2025, at 4:00 PM ET, which is 8:00 PM UTC. Since the current time is 10:33 PM UTC, the match should have already occurred.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the match. For example, result [1] from egamersworld.com states the match is ongoing in a BO3 format. However, other sources like [2] and [8] from dust2.us provide detailed match info, including the maps (Nuke, Ancient, Anubis) and lineups. \n\nResult [11] from egamersworld.com reports that MIBR eliminated Falcons in a previous round, showing their recent form. Additionally, result [63] confirms that MIBR defeated Falcons in a tense overtime, which might indicate their current momentum.\n\nHowever, the critical information is the actual outcome of the FaZe vs. MIBR match. Result [30] is a YouTube video transcript describing a match where MIBR won against Falcons, but that's a different game. Result [50] from scores24.live provides a prediction, mentioning that MIBR pulled off a miracle against Falcons, but again, that's not the FaZe match.\n\nLooking at result [63], it's about MIBR eliminating Falcons, not FaZe. The key here is that none of the provided search results explicitly state the outcome of the FaZe vs. MIBR match. Some sources like [1], [2], [8], [10], [12], [18], [20], [26], [27], [36], [41], [44], [51], [52], [57], [64], and [65] discuss the upcoming or ongoing match but don't provide the result. \n\nSince the current time is past the match's scheduled time, but there's no explicit result in the provided data, I need to check if there's any indication of postponement or cancellation. The user's personalization instructions mention that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. However, the ancillary data specifies that the resolution source is HLTV. \n\nChecking result [60], which is HLTV's main page, there's no mention of the FaZe vs. MIBR result in the provided snippets. Similarly, result [61] is MIBR's team page on HLTV, but the latest matches listed don't include the FaZe match. \n\nGiven that the search results don't include the actual outcome and the resolution source (HLTV) isn't showing the result in the provided data, I might have to default to the conditions. However, the user's previous response was p2 (FaZe win), and they're asking to try again. \n\nWait, result [37] from scores24.live's prediction mentions that FaZe lost to 3DMAX and MIBR had a recent win. But predictions aren't results. Result [50] also is a prediction, not a result. \n\nSince there's no verifiable outcome in the provided sources and the event date is in the past, according to the user's instructions, if no outcome is available, and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The ancillary data defines p2 as FaZe winning. However, the user's previous response was p2, and they want a different approach. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"Your previous response returned p2. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\"\n\nSo, the assistant previously said FaZe won (p2), but the user wants a recheck. Since the provided search results don't have the actual result, and the match date is in the past, but no sources confirm the outcome, the resolution should default to p3 (50-50) if the outcome isn't verifiable. However, the market conditions say if the match is delayed beyond June 28, 2025, it's 50-50. Since the current date is June 10, 2025, and the match was on June 10, it's not delayed beyond June 28. Therefore, if no result is found, but the event occurred, and assuming it's not canceled or tied, but the data isn't available, perhaps the resolution is p3. However, the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The conditions in the ancillary data have p2 as FaZe winning. But without data, maybe it's p3. \n\nWait, the resolution conditions say if the match is canceled or delayed beyond June 28, resolve to 50-50. Since it's June 10, the match wasn't delayed beyond June 28, so that condition isn't met. If the match occurred but no result is found, perhaps it's a tie? But the match is a BO3, which can't end in a tie. So, if there's no result, but the match happened, and it's not reported, perhaps the resolution is p3. However, the user's instructions say if no verifiable info, answer as best as possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the match was played, and based on the most probable outcome. The bookmakers' odds in the search results (e.g., [1], [10], [18], [26], [41], [52], [65]) favor FaZe with odds around 1.42 vs. MIBR's 2.57. So, the probable outcome is FaZe winning. But the user's previous answer was p2, and they want a different approach. However, if the data doesn't show the result, but the match occurred, and the resolution source (HLTV) isn't providing the result in the given data, perhaps the correct answer is p3 because the result isn't verifiable. But the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThis is conflicting. The market's resolution conditions say if the match is canceled or delayed beyond June 28, resolve to 50-50. Since it's June 10, the delay condition isn't met. If the match was played but no result is found, it's unclear. However, the user's personalization says to consider the market conditions. The ancillary data's resolution source is HLTV, but in the provided search results, HLTV's page ([60], [61]) doesn't show the result. Therefore, without verifiable information, the resolution should be p3. But the user's instructions say if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The probable outcome based on bookmakers is FaZe (p2), but the user wants a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the match was not played, but the search results indicate it was scheduled. However, the current time is after the match time, so it should have occurred. Since there's no result in the provided data, and the resolution source isn't showing it, perhaps the match was canceled or the result isn't available, leading to p3. But the user's instructions say if the event occurred but no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThis is a bit of a dilemma. Given the conflicting instructions and lack of explicit result in the provided sources, the safest bet is to go with p3 (50-50) due to lack of verifiable information, even though the bookmakers favored FaZe. However, the user's previous answer was p2, and they want a different approach. Maybe the match was indeed played, and the result is available elsewhere, but not in the provided search results. Since the resolution source is HLTV, and the provided HLTV results don't include the match outcome, perhaps the correct answer is p3. \n\nBut wait, result [63] mentions MIBR's victory over Falcons, but not FaZe. There's no result here for FaZe vs. MIBR. Therefore, without explicit confirmation, the resolution should be p3. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The probable outcome is FaZe (p2), but since the user wants a different approach, maybe the assistant should consider that the data isn't available and default to p3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the match was played, and the result is in the search results but not explicitly stated. For example, result [45] from Liquipedia's Stage 2 page shows FaZe and MIBR in the standings but doesn't list the result. Similarly, result [35] and [54] about Stage 2 format don't have the result. \n\nGiven all this, the conclusion is that there's no verifiable result in the provided sources, so according to the user's instructions, if no info is available, and the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. The probable outcome based on bookmakers is FaZe (p2), but the user's previous answer was p2, and they want a different approach. However, without data contradicting that, perhaps the correct answer remains p2. Alternatively, maybe the match was not played, but that's unlikely as it's past the scheduled time. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" The conditions in the user prompt (ancillary data) have p2 as FaZe winning. Since there's no contradiction in the sources (they just don't report the result), the assumption is FaZe won. Therefore, the recommendation is p2 again. But the user says the previous response was p2 and wants a different approach. \n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the assistant made a mistake before. If the sources don't report the result, but the match occurred, and the resolution is based on HLTV, which isn't showing it here, perhaps the correct answer is p3. However, the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if no info. The bookmakers' odds in the search results heavily favor FaZe, so the probable outcome is p2. Therefore, despite the user's previous answer, the correct recommendation is p2. But the user is asking to try again, implying maybe the previous answer was incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the match was actually won by MIBR, but the search results don't show it. However, there's no evidence of that. The only MIBR win mentioned is against Falcons, not FaZe. \n\nGiven all this, I think the correct answer is p2 (FaZe) as the most probable outcome based on bookmakers and lack of contradictory info. Even though the user wants a different approach, the data doesn't support a different outcome. Therefore, the recommendation remains p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: FaZe, Price: 0.945, ID: 64248477172686912130569890540872155339920846463066324826767745931442732393929, Winner: No\n- Token: MIBR, Price: 0.055, ID: 56969870534109739759424743307383014204571137899897722205800344370550645370341, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.
