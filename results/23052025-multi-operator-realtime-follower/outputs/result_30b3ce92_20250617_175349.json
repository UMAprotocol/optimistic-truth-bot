      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the @pumpdotfun X account will be unsuspended between June 16, 4:20 PM ET and June 20, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The resolution depends on whether the account is reinstated during that period.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current status of the account. The search results mention that the suspension happened on June 16, 2025. The current date given in the system is June 17, 2025, so we're within the resolution window. \n\nLooking at the sources, multiple articles (like [1], [2], [3], [9], [41], [74]) confirm the suspension. GMGN, another affected account, mentioned they're appealing the suspension ([1], [9], [41]). However, there's no information yet on whether Pump.fun's account has been restored. \n\nThe reasons for suspension are speculated to be API misuse ([1], [6], [9], [41]) or potential SEC scrutiny ([5], [6], [44]), but nothing is confirmed. The user's query is about the account's status, not the reason. \n\nSince the resolution period is until June 20, and today is June 17, there's still time for an appeal. However, based on the provided data, there's no indication that the account has been reinstated yet. The user needs to know if it will happen by June 20. \n\nThe search results don't mention any successful appeals or reinstatements for Pump.fun as of June 17. GMGN is actively appealing, but Pump.fun's status remains suspended. Without new information, the safe assumption is that the account remains suspended. Therefore, the resolution would lean towards \"No\" unless there's an update. However, since the window is still open, but no evidence of reinstatement exists, the recommendation would be p4 (cannot resolve now) if the event is still pending. But the current timestamp is June 17, and the event end is June 20. Since the user is asking as of June 17, and the event hasn't concluded, but the user's personalization says if the event is in the future, return p4. Wait, the current timestamp is 2025-06-17 17:48:36 UTC. The resolution period ends on June 20, which is in the future. Therefore, according to the personalization rules, if the event date is in the future, return p4. But the suspension happened on June 16, which is in the past. The resolution period is from June 16 to June 20. Since the current date is June 17, part of the resolution period is in the future. However, the user is asking to resolve based on whether the account is unsuspended during that window. Since the window is still open, and the event hasn't concluded, but the user's instruction says if the event is scheduled for a future date or hasn't occurred yet, return p4. However, the suspension occurred on June 16 (past), and the unsuspension could happen anytime up to June 20. Since the current time is June 17, the event is ongoing. The personalization says if the event is scheduled for a future date or hasn't occurred yet, return p4. But the event is ongoing. The user's instruction also says if the event date is in the past but no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, the resolution period is still ongoing. Wait, the current date is June 17, and the resolution period ends on June 20. So part of the period is future. Therefore, according to the rules, if the event is scheduled for a future date, return p4. But the event is partially in the past and future. The user's instruction says if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, return p4. Since the resolution period includes future dates (up to June 20), and the current time is June 17, the event is still pending. Therefore, the recommendation should be p4. However, the user's personalization also says if the event date is in the past, but no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. But the resolution period is from June 16 to June 20. Since it's June 17, the event is ongoing. Therefore, the correct approach is to check if the account has been unsuspended as of now. If not, and the window is still open, but no info, then it's unresolved. However, the user's instruction says if the event is in the future, return p4. Since part of the event is in the future, but the suspension happened in the past, it's a bit tricky. The query is whether the account is unsuspended by June 20. Since the current date is June 17, and the event hasn't concluded, but the user is asking now, the system should return p4 because the event hasn't concluded. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. Wait, the event's end date is June 20, which is in the future. Therefore, the event is still ongoing, and the resolution can't be determined yet. Hence, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750182516 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-17 17:48:36 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the @pumpdotfun X account will be unsuspended between June 16, 4:20 PM ET and June 20, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The resolution depends on whether the account is reinstated during that period.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current status of the account. The search results mention that the suspension happened on June 16, 2025. The current date given in the system is June 17, 2025, so we're within the resolution window. \n\nLooking at the sources, multiple articles (like [1], [2], [3], [9], [41], [74]) confirm the suspension. GMGN, another affected account, mentioned they're appealing the suspension ([1], [9], [41]). However, there's no information yet on whether Pump.fun's account has been restored. \n\nThe reasons for suspension are speculated to be API misuse ([1], [6], [9], [41]) or potential SEC scrutiny ([5], [6], [44]), but nothing is confirmed. The user's query is about the account's status, not the reason. \n\nSince the resolution period is until June 20, and today is June 17, there's still time for an appeal. However, based on the provided data, there's no indication that the account has been reinstated yet. The user needs to know if it will happen by June 20. \n\nThe search results don't mention any successful appeals or reinstatements for Pump.fun as of June 17. GMGN is actively appealing, but Pump.fun's status remains suspended. Without new information, the safe assumption is that the account remains suspended. Therefore, the resolution would lean towards \"No\" unless there's an update. However, since the window is still open, but no evidence of reinstatement exists, the recommendation would be p4 (cannot resolve now) if the event is still pending. But the current timestamp is June 17, and the event end is June 20. Since the user is asking as of June 17, and the event hasn't concluded, but the user's personalization says if the event is in the future, return p4. Wait, the current timestamp is 2025-06-17 17:48:36 UTC. The resolution period ends on June 20, which is in the future. Therefore, according to the personalization rules, if the event date is in the future, return p4. But the suspension happened on June 16, which is in the past. The resolution period is from June 16 to June 20. Since the current date is June 17, part of the resolution period is in the future. However, the user is asking to resolve based on whether the account is unsuspended during that window. Since the window is still open, and the event hasn't concluded, but the user's instruction says if the event is scheduled for a future date or hasn't occurred yet, return p4. However, the suspension occurred on June 16 (past), and the unsuspension could happen anytime up to June 20. Since the current time is June 17, the event is ongoing. The personalization says if the event is scheduled for a future date or hasn't occurred yet, return p4. But the event is ongoing. The user's instruction also says if the event date is in the past but no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, the resolution period is still ongoing. Wait, the current date is June 17, and the resolution period ends on June 20. So part of the period is future. Therefore, according to the rules, if the event is scheduled for a future date, return p4. But the event is partially in the past and future. The user's instruction says if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, return p4. Since the resolution period includes future dates (up to June 20), and the current time is June 17, the event is still pending. Therefore, the recommendation should be p4. However, the user's personalization also says if the event date is in the past, but no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. But the resolution period is from June 16 to June 20. Since it's June 17, the event is ongoing. Therefore, the correct approach is to check if the account has been unsuspended as of now. If not, and the window is still open, but no info, then it's unresolved. However, the user's instruction says if the event is in the future, return p4. Since part of the event is in the future, but the suspension happened in the past, it's a bit tricky. The query is whether the account is unsuspended by June 20. Since the current date is June 17, and the event hasn't concluded, but the user is asking now, the system should return p4 because the event hasn't concluded. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. Wait, the event's end date is June 20, which is in the future. Therefore, the event is still ongoing, and the resolution can't be determined yet. Hence, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.9985, ID: 38095453243172310796199646261630023630970609950377976008350975905388687912651, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.0015, ID: 88981305722589376690032453688570698698989058371572449524922004858577839988644, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.999 = 99.9% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the @pumpdotfun X account will be unsuspended between June 16, 4:20 PM ET and June 20, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The resolution depends on whether the account is reinstated within that window. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current status of the account. The search results mention that the suspension happened on June 16, 2025. The current date given in the system is June 17, 2025, so we're within the resolution period. \n\nLooking at the sources, multiple articles (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14) confirm that Pump.fun's X account was suspended on June 16. The reason isn't officially stated, but there's speculation about API misuse or regulatory issues. Some platforms like GMGN are appealing their suspensions (1, 14), but there's no mention of Pump.fun doing the same yet.\n\nThe key point is whether the account gets unsuspended by June 20. The user's ancillary data defines \"Yes\" (p2) if it's unsuspended anytime in that window. Since the suspension is recent and the timeframe is only a few days, I need to assess the likelihood of reinstatement. \n\nFactors to consider: X's typical response time for appeals, the reason for suspension, and any actions Pump.fun is taking. The search results don't indicate any successful appeals yet. GMGN is appealing, but Pump.fun's status remains suspended as of the latest info (5, 12). \n\nThere's also a mention of a possible SEC investigation (3, 7, 14), which could complicate reinstatement. If the suspension is due to regulatory scrutiny, it might take longer than a few days to resolve. Additionally, the use of unauthorized APIs (1, 7, 14) might require Pump.fun to comply with X's policies, which could involve paying for API access or other changes, potentially delaying reinstatement.\n\nGiven that the current date is June 17 and the deadline is June 20, there's a short window. Without evidence of an appeal in progress or communication from X, it's uncertain. However, the market's resolution conditions allow using credible reporting. The sources don't report any unsuspension yet, and the latest info (as of June 17) still shows the account as suspended. \n\nTherefore, unless there's new information indicating the account was reinstated before June 20, the resolution would be \"No\" (p1). But since the user provided a personalization instruction to consider strong market sentiment and align the recommendation, I need to check if there's any market sentiment leaning towards a possible reinstatement. However, the search results don't mention any such sentiment; instead, they highlight the negative impact on Pump.fun's operations and upcoming token sale. \n\nIn conclusion, based on the available information up to June 17, the account remains suspended with no signs of imminent reinstatement. Thus, the recommendation would be \"No\" (p1). But wait, the user's personalization says to re-evaluate considering strong market sentiment. If the market expects a quick resolution due to appeals, maybe there's a bias towards \"Yes\". However, without concrete evidence of an appeal's success, it's speculative. The safe bet based on current data is \"No\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The user wants to know if the @pumpdotfun X account will be unsuspended between June 16, 4:20 PM ET and June 20, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The resolution depends on whether the account is reinstated within that window. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current status of the account. The search results mention that the suspension happened on June 16, 2025. The current date given in the system is June 17, 2025, so we're within the resolution period. \n\nLooking at the sources, multiple articles (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14) confirm that Pump.fun's X account was suspended on June 16. The reason isn't officially stated, but there's speculation about API misuse or regulatory issues. Some platforms like GMGN are appealing their suspensions (1, 14), but there's no mention of Pump.fun doing the same yet.\n\nThe key point is whether the account gets unsuspended by June 20. The user's ancillary data defines \"Yes\" (p2) if it's unsuspended anytime in that window. Since the suspension is recent and the timeframe is only a few days, I need to assess the likelihood of reinstatement. \n\nFactors to consider: X's typical response time for appeals, the reason for suspension, and any actions Pump.fun is taking. The search results don't indicate any successful appeals yet. GMGN is appealing, but Pump.fun's status remains suspended as of the latest info (5, 12). \n\nThere's also a mention of a possible SEC investigation (3, 7, 14), which could complicate reinstatement. If the suspension is due to regulatory scrutiny, it might take longer than a few days to resolve. Additionally, the use of unauthorized APIs (1, 7, 14) might require Pump.fun to comply with X's policies, which could involve paying for API access or other changes, potentially delaying reinstatement.\n\nGiven that the current date is June 17 and the deadline is June 20, there's a short window. Without evidence of an appeal in progress or communication from X, it's uncertain. However, the market's resolution conditions allow using credible reporting. The sources don't report any unsuspension yet, and the latest info (as of June 17) still shows the account as suspended. \n\nTherefore, unless there's new information indicating the account was reinstated before June 20, the resolution would be \"No\" (p1). But since the user provided a personalization instruction to consider strong market sentiment and align the recommendation, I need to check if there's any market sentiment leaning towards a possible reinstatement. However, the search results don't mention any such sentiment; instead, they highlight the negative impact on Pump.fun's operations and upcoming token sale. \n\nIn conclusion, based on the available information up to June 17, the account remains suspended with no signs of imminent reinstatement. Thus, the recommendation would be \"No\" (p1). But wait, the user's personalization says to re-evaluate considering strong market sentiment. If the market expects a quick resolution due to appeals, maybe there's a bias towards \"Yes\". However, without concrete evidence of an appeal's success, it's speculative. The safe bet based on current data is \"No\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.9985, ID: 38095453243172310796199646261630023630970609950377976008350975905388687912651, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.0015, ID: 88981305722589376690032453688570698698989058371572449524922004858577839988644, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.999 = 99.9% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
