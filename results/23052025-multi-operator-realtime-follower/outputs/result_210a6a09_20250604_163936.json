Additionally, search result [53] specifically states that Trump's administration is pushing for more coal power, and he signed an executive order related to coal. \n\nFurthermore, search result [65] from the PBS coverage of the May 30 rally quotes Trump saying, \"We saved the company,\" but also mentions his administration's focus on coal. Although the exact word \"coal\" isn't in the snippet, other related terms like \"coal-powered steel production\" are present in the context. \n\nHowever, the key evidence comes from search result [46], which is a transcript of Trump's speech at the Pittsburgh rally.

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

The user provided a lot of sources, so I'll go through them systematically.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention Trump's speech at the U.S. Steel plant in Pittsburgh. For example, source [11] from publicsource.org details Trump's rally where he discussed the U.S. Steel deal with Nippon. In his speech, he said, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have a steel mill open in the country if we didn\u2019t do the tariffs,\u201d but there's no mention of \"coal\" here.\n\nSource [12] is a transcript of Trump signing an executive order on the coal industry. However, this event is from a different date (April 8, 2025) and location, not the May 30 rally in Pittsburgh. So that's not relevant to this specific query.\n\nSource [19] from insideclimatenews.org mentions Trump's celebration of the U.S. Steel deal and his administration's push for more coal power, including an executive order titled \u201cReinvigorating America\u2019s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry.\u201d However, this article is about the broader context of coal in Pennsylvania, not the specific rally on May 30.\n\nSource [20] (another publicsource.org link) quotes Trump at the May 30 rally: \u201cIf you don\u2019t have steel, you don\u2019t have a country. It\u2019s above all a matter of national security.\u201d Again, no mention of \"coal.\"\n\nSource [25] (insideclimatenews.org again) discusses Trump's reversal on the U.S. Steel deal and mentions his executive order on coal, but again, this is from a different event.\n\nSource [33] is a White House press release about the Pittsburgh rally, highlighting Trump's speech on American steel and jobs. The quotes from workers and Trump focus on steel, not coal.\n\nSource [58] is a transcript of a press gaggle on May 30 where Trump answers questions about the U.S. Steel deal. He talks about tariffs and investments but doesn't mention coal.\n\nSource [63] (PBS) covers the same rally, with Trump announcing doubled steel tariffs. The transcript here doesn't include the word \"coal.\"\n\nSource [66] from marketscreener.com reports Trump's speech at the rally, mentioning the tariff increase and the U.S. Steel partnership. The article focuses on steel and aluminum, not coal.\n\nOther sources, like [27], [34], [35], and [44], discuss the rally's impact on the local economy and steel industry but don't mention coal.\n\nI need to ensure I didn't miss any mentions. Let me check again. The key here is the specific event on May 30. While Trump has a history of discussing coal, especially in Pennsylvania (as seen in sources like [6], [12], [29], [45], [47]), those instances are from different events or timeframes. The May 30 rally was focused on the U.S. Steel deal and tariffs. None of the direct quotes or reports from that day's event include the word \"coal.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the provided sources, Trump did not say \"coal\" during the May 30, 2025, Pittsburgh rally.

The user wants to know if Trump said the word \"Coal\" during his Pittsburgh rally on May 30, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mentions of \"coal\" in the context of that rally. The user provided a lot of sources, so I'll go through them systematically.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention Trump's speech at the U.S. Steel plant in Pittsburgh. For example, source [11] from publicsource.org details Trump's rally where he discussed the U.S. Steel deal with Nippon. In his speech, he said, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have a steel mill open in the country if we didn\u2019t do the tariffs,\u201d but there's no mention of \"coal\" here.\n\nSource [12] is a transcript of Trump signing an executive order on the coal industry. However, this event is from a different date (April 8, 2025) and location, not the May 30 rally in Pittsburgh. So that's not relevant to this specific query.\n\nSource [19] from insideclimatenews.org mentions Trump's celebration of the U.S. Steel deal and his administration's push for more coal power, including an executive order titled \u201cReinvigorating America\u2019s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry.\u201d However, this article is about the broader context of coal in Pennsylvania, not the specific rally on May 30.\n\nSource [20] (another publicsource.org link) quotes Trump at the May 30 rally: \u201cIf you don\u2019t have steel, you don\u2019t have a country. It\u2019s above all a matter of national security.\u201d Again, no mention of \"coal.\"\n\nSource [25] (insideclimatenews.org again) discusses Trump's reversal on the U.S. Steel deal and mentions his executive order on coal, but again, this is from a different event.\n\nSource [33] is a White House press release about the Pittsburgh rally, highlighting Trump's speech on American steel and jobs. The quotes from workers and Trump focus on steel, not coal.\n\nSource [58] is a transcript of a press gaggle on May 30 where Trump answers questions about the U.S. Steel deal. He talks about tariffs and investments but doesn't mention coal.\n\nSource [63] (PBS) covers the same rally, with Trump announcing doubled steel tariffs. The transcript here doesn't include the word \"coal.\"\n\nSource [66] from marketscreener.com reports Trump's speech at the rally, mentioning the tariff increase and the U.S. Steel partnership. The article focuses on steel and aluminum, not coal.\n\nOther sources, like [27], [34], [35], and [44], discuss the rally's impact on the local economy and steel industry but don't mention coal.\n\nI need to ensure I didn't miss any mentions. Let me check again. The key here is the specific event on May 30. While Trump has a history of discussing coal, especially in Pennsylvania (as seen in sources like [6], [12], [29], [45], [47]), those instances are from different events or timeframes. The May 30 rally was focused on the U.S. Steel deal and tariffs. None of the direct quotes or reports from that day's event include the word \"coal.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the provided sources, Trump did not say \"coal\" during the May 30, 2025, Pittsburgh rally. The market should resolve to \"No\" (p1).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0, ID: 9514113900836670914262335324424141503601680058186608724176019463152098226252, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 1, ID: 88740454761072848938167012283918154457192658235322474598146584179553304546353, Winner: Yes\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
