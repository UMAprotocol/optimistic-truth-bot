Try other solvers or a combination approach.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: perplexity\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.

The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The key points from the sources:\n\n1. Search result [2] mentions Israel's Operation Rising Lion on June 13, targeting Iran. It also states that Israel used Iraqi airspace for the strikes. The IDF launched over 200 aircraft and 330 munitions, and Mossad conducted covert operations near Tehran. The Israeli Defense Minister declared a state of emergency, anticipating retaliation.\n\n2. Search result [13] and [14] discuss Iraq filing a UN complaint over Israeli airspace violation. Iraq's Foreign Ministry submitted a formal complaint, stating that Israel used Iraqi airspace to carry out attacks in the region. This is a clear indication of military action in Iraqi airspace.\n\n3. Search result [16] and [17] also mention Iraq condemning Israel's use of its airspace for strikes on Iran, further confirming the violation.\n\n4. The user's update clarifies that intercepting drones/missiles over Iraq doesn't count. However, the sources don't mention Israel intercepting anything over Iraq; instead, they confirm Israel's active use of Iraqi airspace to launch attacks on Iran.\n\nAccording to the market's definition, any military action in Iraqi airspace by Israel qualifies as a \"Yes.\" The Israeli government's acknowledgment or credible reports are present in multiple sources, including Iraq's official complaints to the UN. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be p2 (Yes) because Israel's military actions involved using Iraqi airspace, which meets the criteria outlined.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.

The user wants to know if Israel initiated a military action against Iraq between June 11 and June 13, 2025, based on the defined criteria. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The key points from the sources:\n\n1. Search result [2] mentions Israel's Operation Rising Lion on June 13, targeting Iran. It also states that Israel used Iraqi airspace for the strikes. The IDF launched over 200 aircraft and 330 munitions, and Mossad conducted covert operations near Tehran. The Israeli Defense Minister declared a state of emergency, anticipating retaliation.\n\n2. Search result [13] and [14] discuss Iraq filing a UN complaint over Israeli airspace violation. Iraq's Foreign Ministry submitted a formal complaint, stating that Israel used Iraqi airspace to carry out attacks in the region. This is a clear indication of military action in Iraqi airspace.\n\n3. Search result [16] and [17] also mention Iraq condemning Israel's use of its airspace for strikes on Iran, further confirming the violation.\n\n4. The user's update clarifies that intercepting drones/missiles over Iraq doesn't count. However, the sources don't mention Israel intercepting anything over Iraq; instead, they confirm Israel's active use of Iraqi airspace to launch attacks on Iran.\n\nAccording to the market's definition, any military action in Iraqi airspace by Israel qualifies as a \"Yes.\" The Israeli government's acknowledgment or credible reports are present in multiple sources, including Iraq's official complaints to the UN. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be p2 (Yes) because Israel's military actions involved using Iraqi airspace, which meets the criteria outlined.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.0295, ID: 12803410034085656249393889057793493953015869632023114499735860186556348968741, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.9705, ID: 11262683098933029510443984378265710685633107850453807153106850013012480072228, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (0.971 = 97.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

There's also information about the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) in Iraq and some airstrikes, but most of those are attributed to the US, not Israel.\n\nLooking at the search results, the main events are the Israeli strikes on Iran on June 13, 2025, codenamed Operation Rising Lion, and Iran's retaliation with Operation True Promise III. The Israeli operation targeted Iranian nuclear facilities and military sites, with mentions of Mossad operations within Iran. However, there's no direct mention of Israel conducting military actions in Iraq itself during the specified dates.\n\nThere are references to the PMF in Iraq and some airstrikes, but these are either by the US or unspecified actors. For example, search result [18] mentions an airstrike on a PMF base in Iraq, but the attribution is unclear, with some sources suggesting it might be Israel, but others denying it. The user's update note clarifies that intercepting drones/missiles over Iraqi territory doesn't count. \n\nAdditionally, search result [44] mentions Iraq filing a UN complaint over Israeli airspace violation during the Iran strikes, implying that Israel used Iraqi airspace. However, the market's resolution conditions specify that military action includes use of force on Iraqi soil, airspace, or maritime territory. If Israel's aircraft passed through Iraqi airspace to strike Iran, does that count? The update note says intercepting third-party drones/missiles over Iraq doesn't qualify, but using Iraqi airspace for strikes elsewhere might. However, the market's definition of military action requires the action to be against Iraq or its assets. Since the target was Iran, not Iraq, even if airspace was used, it might not meet the criteria unless the action was against Iraqi territory or assets.\n\nFurther, search result [56] mentions three missiles found in Iraq, possibly from the Israeli strike on Iran. If those missiles were part of the Israeli operation and landed in Iraq, that could count as military action on Iraqi soil. However, the sources are unclear on the origin of these missiles. The Iraqi government's complaint to the UN (results [44], [56], [58]) accuses Israel of violating airspace, but without confirmation of actual attacks on Iraqi targets.\n\nThe key points are: Did Israel attack Iraqi soil, airspace, or maritime territory, or Iraqi embassies/consulates? The evidence points to possible airspace violation but not direct military action against Iraq. The market requires the action to be against Iraq, not just using its airspace for strikes elsewhere. Therefore, unless there's confirmed Israeli strikes on Iraqi targets, the answer should be \"No\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe query asks whether Israel initiated military action against Iraq between June 11 and June 13, 2025. The ancillary data defines \"military action\" as Israeli use of force on Iraqi soil, airspace, or maritime territory, or against Iraqi embassies/consulates, excluding cyberattacks or diplomatic measures.  \n\n### Key Findings:  \n1. **Israeli Strikes Targeted Iran, Not Iraq**:  \n   - Israel conducted **Operation Rising Lion** on June 13, 2025, targeting Iranian nuclear facilities, military sites, and leadership[1][3][5][16][24][40]. These strikes occurred in Iran (e.g., Natanz, Tehran) and did not involve Iraqi territory or assets[1][3][5].  \n\n2. **Iraqi Airspace Violation Claims**:  \n   - Iraq filed a UN complaint alleging Israel violated its airspace during the Iran strikes[44][46][51][55][56][58]. However, **using Iraqi airspace to transit to Iran does not constitute a \"military action against Iraq\"** under the market\u2019s definition unless force was applied to Iraqi targets[44][58].  \n\n3. **Missiles Found in Iraq**:  \n   - Three missiles were discovered in Iraqi desert areas (Diyala and Dhi Qar provinces) on June 13[46][56][57]. While some speculated Israeli involvement, **no credible evidence confirmed Israel targeted Iraqi soil**. The U.S. and Israel denied responsibility, and Iraqi sources did not definitively attribute the missiles to Israel[18][44][56].  \n\n4. **PMF Cancellation of Events**:  \n   - Iraq\u2019s Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) canceled anniversary events due to Iranian commander deaths in Israeli strikes[37]. This reflects regional tensions but does not indicate Israeli military action against Iraq.  \n\n5. **U.S. Strikes in Iraq**:  \n   - U.S. airstrikes targeted Iran-backed militias in Iraq in July 2024[11][31][49], but these are unrelated to Israeli actions.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nIsrael\u2019s June 13 strikes were directed at Iran, with no verified attacks on Iraqi soil, assets, or embassies. While Iraq accused Israel of airspace violations, the market\u2019s criteria require **force applied to Iraqi territory or institutions**, which is unconfirmed. The missiles found in Iraq lack attribution to Israel, and transit through airspace alone does not meet the resolution threshold.  \n\n**Recommendation: p1 (\"No\")**",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749875333 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-14 04:28:53 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query.

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (0.971 = 97.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Try other solvers or a combination approach.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: perplexity\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",

The response also correctly handles the ambiguity around the missiles found in Iraq, noting the lack of credible evidence linking them to an Israeli military action on Iraqi soil. The response is well-structured, providing a clear rationale for the recommendation based on the specific terms of the query.",
