Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\"), college football (e.g., \"What was the score of the Alabama game last Saturday?\"), college basketball (e.g., \"What was Duke's score in their last game?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Mariners vs. Astros, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for May 23 at 8:10PM ET:\nIf the Seattle Mariners win, the market will resolve to \"Mariners\".\nIf the Houston Astros win, the market will resolve to \"Astros\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\nTo know when a postponed game will be played, please check the home team's schedule on MLB.com for the listed team and look for the game described as a makeup game.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Astros, p2 to Mariners, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1748055625 Current Date and Time: 2025-05-24 03:00:25 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\n# Load environment variables\nload_dotenv()\nAPI_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\nif not API_KEY:\n    raise ValueError(\"Missing SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\n\n# API configuration\nHEADERS = {\"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key\": API_KEY}\nPRIMARY_ENDPOINT = \"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json\"\nPROXY_ENDPOINT = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\"\n\n# Game details\nGAME_DATE = \"2025-05-23\"\nHOME_TEAM = \"Astros\"\nAWAY_TEAM = \"Mariners\"\n\n# Resolution map\nRESOLUTION_MAP = {\n    \"Astros\": \"p1\",\n    \"Mariners\": \"p2\",\n    \"50-50\": \"p3\",\n    \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\"\n}\n\ndef get_data(url, headers):\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        return response.json()\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error fetching data: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef find_game(games, home_team, away_team):\n    for game in games:\n        if game['HomeTeam'] == home_team and game['AwayTeam'] == away_team:\n            return game\n    return None\n\ndef resolve_market(game):\n    if not game:\n        return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"Too early to resolve\"]\n    if game['Status'] == 'Final':\n        if game['HomeTeamRuns'] > game['AwayTeamRuns']:\n            return RESOLUTION_MAP[game['HomeTeam']]\n        elif game['HomeTeamRuns'] < game['AwayTeamRuns']:\n            return RESOLUTION_MAP[game['AwayTeam']]\n    elif game['Status'] in ['Canceled', 'Postponed']:\n        return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"50-50\"]\n    return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"Too early to resolve\"]\n\ndef main():\n    # Construct URL for the game date\n    url = f\"{PRIMARY_ENDPOINT}/GamesByDate/{GAME_DATE}\"\n    games = get_data(url, HEADERS)\n    if not games:\n        # Fallback to proxy if primary fails\n        games = get_data(PROXY_ENDPOINT, HEADERS)\n    \n    if games:\n        game = find_game(games, HOME_TEAM, AWAY_TEAM)\n        result = resolve_market(game)\n    else:\n        result = RESOLUTION_MAP[\"Too early to resolve\"]\n    \n    print(f\"recommendation: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nError fetching data: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json/GamesByDate/2025-05-23\nError fetching data: 400 Client Error: Bad Request for url: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\nrecommendation: p4\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Where p1 corresponds to Astros, p2 to Mariners, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Astros, p2 = Mariners\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Mariners outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.930 = 93.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Mariners vs. Astros, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for May 23 at 8:10PM ET:\nIf the Seattle Mariners win, the market will resolve to \"Mariners\".\nIf the Houston Astros win, the market will resolve to \"Astros\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\nTo know when a postponed game will be played, please check the home team's schedule on MLB.com for the listed team and look for the game described as a makeup game.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Astros, p2 to Mariners, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1748055625 Current Date and Time: 2025-05-24 03:00:25 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\n# Load environment variables\nload_dotenv()\nAPI_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\nif not API_KEY:\n    raise ValueError(\"Missing SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\n\n# API configuration\nHEADERS = {\"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key\": API_KEY}\nPRIMARY_ENDPOINT = \"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json\"\nPROXY_ENDPOINT = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\"\n\n# Game details\nGAME_DATE = \"2025-05-23\"\nHOME_TEAM = \"Astros\"\nAWAY_TEAM = \"Mariners\"\n\n# Resolution map\nRESOLUTION_MAP = {\n    \"Astros\": \"p1\",\n    \"Mariners\": \"p2\",\n    \"50-50\": \"p3\",\n    \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\"\n}\n\ndef get_game_data(date, home_team, away_team):\n    url = f\"{PRIMARY_ENDPOINT}/GamesByDate/{date}\"\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, headers=HEADERS, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        games = response.json()\n        for game in games:\n            if game['HomeTeam'] == home_team and game['AwayTeam'] == away_team:\n                return game\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error fetching data from primary endpoint: {e}\")\n        # Fallback to proxy\n        try:\n            proxy_url = f\"{PROXY_ENDPOINT}/mlb/scores/json/GamesByDate/{date}\"\n            response = requests.get(proxy_url, headers=HEADERS, timeout=10)\n            response.raise_for_status()\n            games = response.json()\n            for game in games:\n                if game['HomeTeam'] == home_team and game['AwayTeam'] == away_team:\n                    return game\n        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n            print(f\"Error fetching data from proxy endpoint: {e}\")\n    return None\n\ndef resolve_market(game):\n    if not game:\n        return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"Too early to resolve\"]\n    if game['Status'] == 'Final':\n        if game['HomeTeamRuns'] > game['AwayTeamRuns']:\n            return RESOLUTION_MAP[game['HomeTeam']]\n        elif game['AwayTeamRuns'] > game['HomeTeamRuns']:\n            return RESOLUTION_MAP[game['AwayTeam']]\n    elif game['Status'] in ['Canceled', 'Postponed']:\n        return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"50-50\"]\n    return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"Too early to resolve\"]\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    game_info = get_game_data(GAME_DATE, HOME_TEAM, AWAY_TEAM)\n    recommendation = resolve_market(game_info)\n    print(f\"recommendation: {recommendation}\")\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nError fetching data from primary endpoint: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json/GamesByDate/2025-05-23\nError fetching data from proxy endpoint: 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy/mlb/scores/json/GamesByDate/2025-05-23\nrecommendation: p4\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Where p1 corresponds to Astros, p2 to Mariners, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Astros, p2 = Mariners\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Mariners outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.930 = 93.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Where p1 corresponds to Astros, p2 to Mariners, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1748055625 Current Date and Time: 2025-05-24 03:00:25 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources.

Where p1 corresponds to Astros, p2 to Mariners, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Astros, p2 = Mariners\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Mariners outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.930 = 93.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Mariners vs. Astros game on May 23, 2025. The current timestamp is May 24, 2025, 03:00:25 UTC, which is after the scheduled game time. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as planned. The search results mention the game on May 22 and 23, 2025. Specifically, result [7] from Fox Sports shows a box score for May 23, 2025, indicating the game was played. \n\nLooking at the box score details in results [7] and [24], the Mariners and Astros played, with key players listed. Result [27] mentions Leody Taveras hitting a solo home run for the Mariners, and result [30] notes Isaac Paredes hitting a two-run homer for the Astros. The final score isn't explicitly stated in these snippets, but result [46] on ESPN's live score shows the Astros leading 9-2, which aligns with the May 22 game detailed in results [2], [8], [16], [17], [32], [40], [52], [53], [60], [61], [62]. However, the May 23 game's outcome needs confirmation.\n\nResult [13] provides the starting pitchers for May 24, 2025, but the user's query is about May 23. Result [24] from Fox Sports on May 23, 2025, lists the box score with players but doesn't show the final score. However, result [27] and [30] are highlights from the May 23 game, indicating the game took place. \n\nSince the current date is May 24, 2025, the game on May 23 has already occurred. The ancillary data specifies that if the Astros win, it's p1, and Mariners p2. The resolution depends on the actual outcome. \n\nFrom the search results, the May 22 game was Astros 9-2 Mariners. For May 23, the Fox Sports box score [24] and ESPN's live score [46] don't show the final result, but the YouTube highlights [27], [30] indicate the game was played. However, without explicit final scores in the provided results, I need to infer. \n\nResult [6] and [22] predict the May 23 game, but predictions aren't outcomes. Result [27] shows Taveras homered, and [30] shows Paredes homered, but without the final score. Since the user's personalization instructs to assume the most probable outcome if no info is available, but the game date is in the past. However, the presence of game highlights and box scores suggests the game was completed. \n\nWait, result [7] is a box score for May 23, 2025, but the content is cut off. However, result [24] also from Fox Sports on May 23, 2025, shows the box score with Mariners' Taveras and Astros' Paredes having home runs. The exact final score isn't visible, but the presence of player stats indicates the game was played. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit final score in the provided search results, but knowing the game occurred, I need to check if any result mentions the outcome. Result [46] on ESPN's live score for May 24, 2025, shows \"Mariners vs. Astros - Live Score - May 24, 2025\" but the details are incomplete. However, result [48] from ESPN's recap mentions the Red Sox game, not relevant here. \n\nSince the user's current time is past the event date, and the sources don't explicitly state the May 23 result, but the game was played, I must rely on the available data. The ancillary data says if no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, the presence of game highlights and box scores implies the game was completed. \n\nWait, result [27] is a video titled \"Leody Taveras' solo home run (3) | 05/23/2025\" which is part of the game. Result [30] is \"Isaac Paredes' two-run home run (11) | 05/23/2025\". These indicate the game happened. Without the final score, but considering the Astros' momentum from the previous game (May 22 win), and the starting pitchers Hancock (6.21 ERA) vs. Gusto (4.65 ERA), perhaps the Astros won again. However, the user's personalization requires relying strictly on provided sources. \n\nSince the search results don't explicitly state the May 23 outcome, but the game date is in the past, and the user instruction says if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p1 as Astros win, p2 as Mariners. Without explicit info, but given the Astros' recent form and home advantage, the resolution would be p1. However, the user's instruction says if the event occurred but no info, resolve based on most probable outcome. But the presence of game highlights and box scores suggests the game was played, so there must be a result. \n\nWait, looking again, result [24] from Fox Sports on May 23, 2025, box score shows Mariners' Taveras with a home run and Astros' Paredes with a home run. The exact score isn't visible, but the presence of these stats implies the game was completed. However, without the final score, it's challenging. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's query is about the May 22 game, but the ancillary data mentions May 23. The user might have a typo, but the query clearly states May 23. Given the ambiguity in the search results and the requirement to resolve based on provided data, if no explicit outcome is found, the resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve). However, the personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nBut the game was played, as per the box scores and highlights. Therefore, the result must be available. Since the user's provided search results don't include the final score for May 23, but the May 22 game is well-documented, perhaps the user made an error in the date. However, the query is about May 23. \n\nGiven the strict instructions, if the event occurred but no verifiable outcome is found in the sources, resolve based on the most probable outcome. However, the sources do mention the May 23 game occurred with player stats, so the outcome should be determinable. \n\nWait, result [27] is a highlight from the May 23 game showing Taveras homered, and result [30] shows Paredes homered. The Fox Sports box score [24] lists players but the final score isn't visible. However, the ESPN live score [46] for May 24, 2025, shows \"Mariners vs. Astros - Live Score - May 24, 2025\" but the details are incomplete. \n\nThis is conflicting. Without explicit final score in the provided search results, but knowing the game was played, the resolution is unclear. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The Astros were at home, and considering their previous win, perhaps they won again. But this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, the lack of explicit final score in the provided sources might mean the game was postponed or data is missing. However, the presence of player stats and highlights suggests it was played. Given the strict rules, if the sources don't confirm the outcome, the resolution would be p4. But the user's instruction says if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThis is a tough call. However, since the user provided 63 search results, and some mention the May 23 game but without the final score, I have to conclude that the information isn't present in the provided context. Therefore, per the user's instructions, if no verifiable info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. The Astros were favorites at home, so p1. But I need to check the ancillary data again. \n\nWait, the ancillary data's resolution_conditions have p1 as Astros, p2 as Mariners. If the game was played and the Astros won, it's p1. If Mariners won, p2. If no info, p4. But the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nGiven the conflicting information and lack of explicit final score in the provided sources, the safest recommendation is p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's personalization might require assuming the most probable outcome. But without clear data, it's risky. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the May 23 game is the one detailed in the search results as Astros 9-2 Mariners, but that was May 22. The May 23 game's outcome isn't clear. Therefore, if the user's query is about May 23, and the sources don't provide the result, it's p4. However, the current timestamp is May 24, so the game should have happened. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and strict rules, the recommendation is p4. But I might have missed a source. Let me check again. \n\nResult [24] is a box score for May 23, 2025, but the data is cut off. The Mariners' batters are listed with some stats, but the final score isn't visible. Similarly, result [7] is a box score for May 23, but the content is incomplete. Without the final score, I can't confirm the outcome. Therefore, per the user's instructions, if no verifiable info, resolve to p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nGiven the Astros' home advantage and previous win, but without explicit data, it's a guess. However, the user's instructions require strict adherence to provided sources. Since the sources don't confirm the outcome, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1748055625 Current Date and Time: 2025-05-24 03:00:25 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Mariners vs. Astros game on May 23, 2025. The current timestamp is May 24, 2025, 03:00:25 UTC, which is after the scheduled game time. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as planned. The search results mention the game on May 22 and 23, 2025. Specifically, result [7] from Fox Sports shows a box score for May 23, 2025, indicating the game was played. \n\nLooking at the box score details in results [7] and [24], the Mariners and Astros played, with key players listed. Result [27] mentions Leody Taveras hitting a solo home run for the Mariners, and result [30] notes Isaac Paredes hitting a two-run homer for the Astros. The final score isn't explicitly stated in these snippets, but result [46] on ESPN's live score shows the Astros leading 9-2, which aligns with the May 22 game detailed in results [2], [8], [16], [17], [32], [40], [52], [53], [60], [61], [62]. However, the May 23 game's outcome needs confirmation.\n\nResult [13] provides the starting pitchers for May 24, 2025, but the user's query is about May 23. Result [24] from Fox Sports on May 23, 2025, lists the box score with players but doesn't show the final score. However, result [27] and [30] are highlights from the May 23 game, indicating the game took place. \n\nSince the current date is May 24, 2025, the game on May 23 has already occurred. The ancillary data specifies that if the Astros win, it's p1, and Mariners p2. The resolution depends on the actual outcome. \n\nFrom the search results, the May 22 game was Astros 9-2 Mariners. For May 23, the Fox Sports box score [24] and ESPN's live score [46] don't show the final result, but the YouTube highlights [27], [30] indicate the game was played. However, without explicit final scores in the provided results, I need to infer. \n\nResult [6] and [22] predict the May 23 game, but predictions aren't outcomes. Result [27] shows Taveras homered, and [30] shows Paredes homered, but without the final score. Since the user's personalization instructs to assume the most probable outcome if no info is available, but the game date is in the past. However, the presence of game highlights and box scores suggests the game was completed. \n\nWait, result [7] is a box score for May 23, 2025, but the content is cut off. However, result [24] also from Fox Sports on May 23, 2025, shows the box score with Mariners' Taveras and Astros' Paredes having home runs. The exact final score isn't visible, but the presence of player stats indicates the game was played. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit final score in the provided search results, but knowing the game occurred, I need to check if any result mentions the outcome. Result [46] on ESPN's live score for May 24, 2025, shows \"Mariners vs. Astros - Live Score - May 24, 2025\" but the details are incomplete. However, result [48] from ESPN's recap mentions the Red Sox game, not relevant here. \n\nSince the user's current time is past the event date, and the sources don't explicitly state the May 23 result, but the game was played, I must rely on the available data. The ancillary data says if no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, the presence of game highlights and box scores implies the game was completed. \n\nWait, result [27] is a video titled \"Leody Taveras' solo home run (3) | 05/23/2025\" which is part of the game. Result [30] is \"Isaac Paredes' two-run home run (11) | 05/23/2025\". These indicate the game happened. Without the final score, but considering the Astros' momentum from the previous game (May 22 win), and the starting pitchers Hancock (6.21 ERA) vs. Gusto (4.65 ERA), perhaps the Astros won again. However, the user's personalization requires relying strictly on provided sources. \n\nSince the search results don't explicitly state the May 23 outcome, but the game date is in the past, and the user instruction says if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p1 as Astros win, p2 as Mariners. Without explicit info, but given the Astros' recent form and home advantage, the resolution would be p1. However, the user's instruction says if the event occurred but no info, resolve based on most probable outcome. But the presence of game highlights and box scores suggests the game was played, so there must be a result. \n\nWait, looking again, result [24] from Fox Sports on May 23, 2025, box score shows Mariners' Taveras with a home run and Astros' Paredes with a home run. The exact score isn't visible, but the presence of these stats implies the game was completed. However, without the final score, it's challenging. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's query is about the May 22 game, but the ancillary data mentions May 23. The user might have a typo, but the query clearly states May 23. Given the ambiguity in the search results and the requirement to resolve based on provided data, if no explicit outcome is found, the resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve). However, the personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nBut the game was played, as per the box scores and highlights. Therefore, the result must be available. Since the user's provided search results don't include the final score for May 23, but the May 22 game is well-documented, perhaps the user made an error in the date. However, the query is about May 23. \n\nGiven the strict instructions, if the event occurred but no verifiable outcome is found in the sources, resolve based on the most probable outcome. However, the sources do mention the May 23 game occurred with player stats, so the outcome should be determinable. \n\nWait, result [27] is a highlight from the May 23 game showing Taveras homered, and result [30] shows Paredes homered. The Fox Sports box score [24] lists players but the final score isn't visible. However, the ESPN live score [46] for May 24, 2025, shows \"Mariners vs. Astros - Live Score - May 24, 2025\" but the details are incomplete. \n\nThis is conflicting. Without explicit final score in the provided search results, but knowing the game was played, the resolution is unclear. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The Astros were at home, and considering their previous win, perhaps they won again. But this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, the lack of explicit final score in the provided sources might mean the game was postponed or data is missing. However, the presence of player stats and highlights suggests it was played. Given the strict rules, if the sources don't confirm the outcome, the resolution would be p4. But the user's instruction says if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThis is a tough call. However, since the user provided 63 search results, and some mention the May 23 game but without the final score, I have to conclude that the information isn't present in the provided context. Therefore, per the user's instructions, if no verifiable info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. The Astros were favorites at home, so p1. But I need to check the ancillary data again. \n\nWait, the ancillary data's resolution_conditions have p1 as Astros, p2 as Mariners. If the game was played and the Astros won, it's p1. If Mariners won, p2. If no info, p4. But the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nGiven the conflicting information and lack of explicit final score in the provided sources, the safest recommendation is p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's personalization might require assuming the most probable outcome. But without clear data, it's risky. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the May 23 game is the one detailed in the search results as Astros 9-2 Mariners, but that was May 22. The May 23 game's outcome isn't clear. Therefore, if the user's query is about May 23, and the sources don't provide the result, it's p4. However, the current timestamp is May 24, so the game should have happened. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and strict rules, the recommendation is p4. But I might have missed a source. Let me check again. \n\nResult [24] is a box score for May 23, 2025, but the data is cut off. The Mariners' batters are listed with some stats, but the final score isn't visible. Similarly, result [7] is a box score for May 23, but the content is incomplete. Without the final score, I can't confirm the outcome. Therefore, per the user's instructions, if no verifiable info, resolve to p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nGiven the Astros' home advantage and previous win, but without explicit data, it's a guess. However, the user's instructions require strict adherence to provided sources. Since the sources don't confirm the outcome, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Mariners, Price: 0.93, ID: 81865686405937259659276302667979496603823894471471941815864291089467467164702, Winner: No\n- Token: Astros, Price: 0.07, ID: 67051950935865402051819228795864849118034758219183289717592646761788913332709, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

The resolution conditions are p1 for Astros win, p2 for Mariners win, p3 if canceled, and p4 if the event hasn't occurred yet. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened. The current timestamp is May 24, 2025, 3:00:25 UTC, which is the same day as the game but a few hours later. However, the game was scheduled for 8:10 PM ET on May 23, which is 00:10 UTC on May 24. Since the current time is 03:00 UTC on May 24, the game should have already taken place.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are several sources indicating the outcome. Search result [1] from ESPN mentions the game on May 23 with live coverage, but the detailed stats show the Astros won 5-3. Result [3] is a video of Cal Raleigh's home run in the 7th inning, which put the Mariners ahead 5-3. However, result [15] from the Astros' official MLB page lists the May 23 game as a loss (3-5) against the Mariners. Wait, that's conflicting. \n\nWait, let me cross-check. Result [1] (ESPN) shows the Mariners vs. Astros game on May 23 with a final score of 5-3 in favor of the Mariners. Result [15] from the Astros' site also confirms a loss (3-5) on May 23. Additionally, result [14] shows Leody Taveras hitting a solo homer for the Mariners, and result [3] shows Cal Raleigh's go-ahead homer. The box score in result [2] details the game progression, with the Mariners scoring in the 7th inning. \n\nHowever, there's some confusion because result [4] and [7] talk about the May 22 game where the Astros won 9-2. The user's query is specifically about the May 23 game. The key sources here are [1], [2], [3], [14], and [15], which all point to the May 23 game where the Mariners won 5-3. \n\nTherefore, the Mariners won the game on May 23, so the market should resolve to p2 (Mariners). The conflicting info in some sources might be from different dates, but the May 23 game is clearly covered. No indication of postponement or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable. The event has occurred, so p4 isn't needed. The correct resolution is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Since the current time is 03:00 UTC on May 24, the game should have already taken place.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are several sources indicating the outcome. Search result [1] from ESPN mentions the game on May 23 with live coverage, but the detailed stats show the Astros won 5-3. Result [3] is a video of Cal Raleigh's home run in the 7th inning, which put the Mariners ahead 5-3. However, result [15] from the Astros' official MLB page lists the May 23 game as a loss (3-5) against the Mariners. Wait, that's conflicting. \n\nWait, let me cross-check. Result [1] (ESPN) shows the Mariners vs. Astros game on May 23 with a final score of 5-3 in favor of the Mariners. Result [15] from the Astros' site also confirms a loss (3-5) on May 23. Additionally, result [14] shows Leody Taveras hitting a solo homer for the Mariners, and result [3] shows Cal Raleigh's go-ahead homer. The box score in result [2] details the game progression, with the Mariners scoring in the 7th inning. \n\nHowever, there's some confusion because result [4] and [7] talk about the May 22 game where the Astros won 9-2. The user's query is specifically about the May 23 game. The key sources here are [1], [2], [3], [14], and [15], which all point to the May 23 game where the Mariners won 5-3. \n\nTherefore, the Mariners won the game on May 23, so the market should resolve to p2 (Mariners). The conflicting info in some sources might be from different dates, but the May 23 game is clearly covered. No indication of postponement or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable. The event has occurred, so p4 isn't needed. The correct resolution is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Mariners, Price: 0.93, ID: 81865686405937259659276302667979496603823894471471941815864291089467467164702, Winner: No\n- Token: Astros, Price: 0.07, ID: 67051950935865402051819228795864849118034758219183289717592646761788913332709, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Astros, p2 to Mariners, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Astros, p2 = Mariners\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Mariners outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.930 = 93.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1748055625 Current Date and Time: 2025-05-24 03:00:25 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Consider using a different API or ensuring correct API key configuration to successfully fetch the required data. Alternatively, verify the game outcome through other reliable sources."

However, the response is overly verbose and somewhat repetitive, which could confuse the clarity of the findings. The solver correctly identifies that the game was played based on multiple sources indicating player activity and game highlights. Despite this, the solver concludes with a recommendation of p4 (cannot resolve) due to the absence of a final score. This decision contradicts the strong market sentiment which heavily favors the Mariners, indicating a likely win for them.",
