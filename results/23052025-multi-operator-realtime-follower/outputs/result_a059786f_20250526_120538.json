      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if MicroStrategy purchased Bitcoin between May 20 and May 26, 2025. The resolution depends on an official announcement from MicroStrategy or Michael Saylor during that period.\n\nFirst, I'll check the search results provided. Result [1] is a press release from May 26, 2025, stating that from May 19 to May 25, they acquired 4,020 BTC. The period in question is May 20-26. Since May 25 is within the range, this purchase would count. The announcement was made on May 26, which is within the deadline. So this seems to confirm a \"Yes\" answer.\n\nLooking at other results: [5] mentions a purchase on May 19 of 7,390 BTC, but that's before the window. [14] from May 25 says Saylor confirmed a purchase planned for May 26. However, the press release in [1] already covers up to May 25, and the May 26 purchase isn't mentioned there. But the user's query includes up to May 26, so if there was a purchase on May 26, it should be included. However, the current timestamp is May 26, 12:03 PM UTC, and the press release in [1] was published on May 26 but covers up to May 25. There's no info on May 26 purchases yet. But the resolution source is an announcement during the period. Since the announcement on May 26 (within the timeframe) states purchases up to May 25, that's sufficient for a \"Yes\" because the announcement itself is within May 20-26. The actual purchase dates are May 19-25, but the announcement date is May 26, which is within the window. The query's condition is based on the announcement date, not the purchase dates. Wait, the description says the market resolves to \"Yes\" if MicroStrategy announces between May 20 and May 26 that they have acquired additional Bitcoin. So even if the purchase was on May 19, but the announcement is within the window, does that count? The description says \"acquired additional Bitcoin\" during May 20-26. Wait, no\u2014the announcement needs to be within that window, regardless of when the purchase happened. Wait, the description says: \"if MicroStrategy Incorporated announces between May 20... that they have acquired additional Bitcoin.\" So the announcement date is what matters, not the purchase date. So if they announced during May 20-26 that they bought Bitcoin (even if the purchase was before May 20), does that count? The exact wording is: \"announces between May 20... that they have acquired additional Bitcoin.\" So the acquisition could have happened before, but the announcement is during the window. However, in this case, the purchase period in [1] is May 19-25, and the announcement is May 26. So the announcement is on May 26, which is within the window. Therefore, the answer is \"Yes\" because the announcement was made within the specified dates, even if some purchases were before May 20. But wait, the purchase period in [1] is May 19-25. So part of the purchase period is before May 20. But the announcement on May 26 states that during May 19-25, they acquired Bitcoin. The question is whether the acquisition happened between May 20-26. The description says the market resolves to \"Yes\" if they announce during May 20-26 that they have acquired Bitcoin. It doesn't specify that the acquisition must have occurred within that window. So even if the acquisition was partially before May 20, as long as the announcement is within the window, it's a \"Yes\". Therefore, the announcement on May 26 falls within the period, so the answer is \"Yes\". Additionally, [14] mentions a planned purchase on May 26, but there's no confirmation of that in the search results. The press release in [1] doesn't include May 26, but the announcement date is May 26, which is within the window. Therefore, the correct resolution is \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1748261038 Current Date and Time: 2025-05-26 12:03:58 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query.

So this seems to confirm a \"Yes\" answer.\n\nLooking at other results: [5] mentions a purchase on May 19 of 7,390 BTC, but that's before the window. [14] from May 25 says Saylor confirmed a purchase planned for May 26. However, the press release in [1] already covers up to May 25, and the May 26 purchase isn't mentioned there. But the user's query includes up to May 26, so if there was a purchase on May 26, it should be included. However, the current timestamp is May 26, 12:03 PM UTC, and the press release in [1] was published on May 26 but covers up to May 25. There's no info on May 26 purchases yet. But the resolution source is an announcement during the period. Since the announcement on May 26 (within the timeframe) states purchases up to May 25, that's sufficient for a \"Yes\" because the announcement itself is within May 20-26. The actual purchase dates are May 19-25, but the announcement date is May 26, which is within the window. The query's condition is based on the announcement date, not the purchase dates. Wait, the description says the market resolves to \"Yes\" if MicroStrategy announces between May 20 and May 26 that they have acquired additional Bitcoin. So even if the purchase was on May 19, but the announcement is within the window, does that count? The description says \"acquired additional Bitcoin\" during May 20-26. Wait, no\u2014the announcement needs to be within that window, regardless of when the purchase happened. Wait, the description says: \"if MicroStrategy Incorporated announces between May 20... that they have acquired additional Bitcoin.\" So the announcement date is what matters, not the purchase date. So if they announced during May 20-26 that they bought Bitcoin (even if the purchase was before May 20), does that count? The exact wording is: \"announces between May 20... that they have acquired additional Bitcoin.\" So the acquisition could have happened before, but the announcement is during the window. However, in this case, the purchase period in [1] is May 19-25, and the announcement is May 26. So the announcement is on May 26, which is within the window. Therefore, the answer is \"Yes\" because the announcement was made within the specified dates, even if some purchases were before May 20. But wait, the purchase period in [1] is May 19-25. So part of the purchase period is before May 20. But the announcement on May 26 states that during May 19-25, they acquired Bitcoin. The question is whether the acquisition happened between May 20-26. The description says the market resolves to \"Yes\" if they announce during May 20-26 that they have acquired Bitcoin. It doesn't specify that the acquisition must have occurred within that window. So even if the acquisition was partially before May 20, as long as the announcement is within the window, it's a \"Yes\". Therefore, the announcement on May 26 falls within the period, so the answer is \"Yes\". Additionally, [14] mentions a planned purchase on May 26, but there's no confirmation of that in the search results. The press release in [1] doesn't include May 26, but the announcement date is May 26, which is within the window. Therefore, the correct resolution is \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.39, ID: 101872603334317946423222447986037012233837395744236940156452909862071076176500, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.61, ID: 21054311482629857139273579000972477308140539937251729853902990709910547020551, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market is relatively uncertain (YES: 0.390, NO: 0.610)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
