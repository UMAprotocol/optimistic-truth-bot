For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe perplexity solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: perplexity\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\"), college football (e.g., \"What was the score of the Alabama game last Saturday?\"), college basketball (e.g., \"What was Duke's score in their last game?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

The resolution depends on whether any part of the oblast is shaded red by the deadline. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current status as of June 12, 2025. The search results mention that Russia claims to have advanced into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, but Ukrainian sources deny this. The ISW reports from June 8 and 9 indicate that Russian forces reached the administrative border but haven't been geolocated within Dnipropetrovsk yet. The Ukrainian General Staff and Southern Defense Forces refute the claims, stating fighting is still in Donetsk Oblast.\n\nThe key here is the ISW map. If it doesn't show any red shading in Dnipropetrovsk, then the answer is no. However, the user provided ancillary data that if a negotiated settlement gives Russia control, it counts. But there's no mention of such a settlement. Also, the primary source is ISW, and secondary is DeepStateMap. Both need to be checked. \n\nSince the current date is June 12, and the deadline is June 30, there's still time. However, based on the provided data, there's no confirmed Russian control in Dnipropetrovsk as per ISW. The Russian advances are still contested. Unless there's new information closer to the deadline, the answer would be no. But the user's previous response was p4, so maybe they want a recheck. However, given the sources, the ISW hasn't confirmed any territory in Dnipropetrovsk as captured. Therefore, the recommendation should be p1 (No) unless new evidence emerges. But wait, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp (June 12), and the event is scheduled for a future date (June 30), then it's still future. So the market hasn't resolved yet. But the query is about predicting by June 30. Since the current date is June 12, the event is in the future. According to the personalization rules, if the event is scheduled for a future date, return p4. But the user's note says to assume the most probable outcome if the event date is in the past. Wait, the current timestamp is June 12, 2025, and the resolution date is June 30, which is in the future. Therefore, per the instructions, if the event is scheduled for a future date, return p4. But the user's previous response was p4, and they want a different approach. However, the rules state that if the event is in the future, p4 is correct. But maybe the user wants an assessment based on current likelihood. The ancillary data allows for p3 (50-50) if unknown. However, the ISW reports suggest Russian advances are ongoing but unconfirmed. The Ukrainian denial is strong, but the Russian claims are persistent. It's unclear if they'll capture territory by June 30. However, the user's instructions say if the event is in the future, return p4. But the market resolution is based on the outcome by June 30, which is future. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4. But the user says to try again. Maybe the initial response was p4 because the event is future, but the user wants an educated guess. However, according to the rules, if the event is future, p4 is mandatory. Therefore, despite the current analysis, the recommendation must be p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if Russia will capture territory in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast by June 30, 2025, based on the ISW map. The resolution depends on whether any part of the oblast is shaded red by the deadline. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current status as of June 12, 2025. The search results mention that Russia claims to have advanced into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, but Ukrainian sources deny this. The ISW reports from June 8 and 9 indicate that Russian forces reached the administrative border but haven't been geolocated within Dnipropetrovsk yet. The Ukrainian General Staff and Southern Defense Forces refute the claims, stating fighting is still in Donetsk Oblast.\n\nThe key here is the ISW map. If it doesn't show any red shading in Dnipropetrovsk, then the answer is no. However, the user provided ancillary data that if a negotiated settlement gives Russia control, it counts. But there's no mention of such a settlement. Also, the primary source is ISW, and secondary is DeepStateMap. Both need to be checked. \n\nSince the current date is June 12, and the deadline is June 30, there's still time. However, based on the provided data, there's no confirmed Russian control in Dnipropetrovsk as per ISW. The Russian advances are still contested. Unless there's new information closer to the deadline, the answer would be no. But the user's previous response was p4, so maybe they want a recheck. However, given the sources, the ISW hasn't confirmed any territory in Dnipropetrovsk as captured. Therefore, the recommendation should be p1 (No) unless new evidence emerges. But wait, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp (June 12), and the event is scheduled for a future date (June 30), then it's still future. So the market hasn't resolved yet. But the query is about predicting by June 30. Since the current date is June 12, the event is in the future. According to the personalization rules, if the event is scheduled for a future date, return p4. But the user's note says to assume the most probable outcome if the event date is in the past. Wait, the current timestamp is June 12, 2025, and the resolution date is June 30, which is in the future. Therefore, per the instructions, if the event is scheduled for a future date, return p4. But the user's previous response was p4, and they want a different approach. However, the rules state that if the event is in the future, p4 is correct. But maybe the user wants an assessment based on current likelihood. The ancillary data allows for p3 (50-50) if unknown. However, the ISW reports suggest Russian advances are ongoing but unconfirmed. The Ukrainian denial is strong, but the Russian claims are persistent. It's unclear if they'll capture territory by June 30. However, the user's instructions say if the event is in the future, return p4. But the market resolution is based on the outcome by June 30, which is future. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4. But the user says to try again. Maybe the initial response was p4 because the event is future, but the user wants an educated guess. However, according to the rules, if the event is future, p4 is mandatory. Therefore, despite the current analysis, the recommendation must be p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.99, ID: 100956831542359738430417943946810501101213060494810573893628126673226680525220, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.01, ID: 72525931920618283565561832708314103214294645011710460337908351375734748459374, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.990 = 99.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

While Russian forces have reached the Donetsk-Dnipropetrovsk administrative border and conducted localized assaults near Velyka Novosilka, ISW explicitly states there is no geolocated evidence of advances into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast[24][34]. The DeepStateMap similarly shows Russian forces within 2 km of the oblast border but does not indicate control of any Dnipropetrovsk settlements[2][16].  \n\nRussian claims of territorial gains in the oblast[14][21] have been refuted by Ukrainian officials and independent analysts[18][34]. ISW assesses current Russian operations near the border as part of ongoing efforts in Donetsk Oblast, not a dedicated offensive into Dnipropetrovsk[59]. Mandatory evacuations in frontline villages like Mezhova[75] indicate proximity to combat but do not constitute Russian control.  \n\nGiven the current rate of advance (14.3 km\u00b2/day)[46] and fortified Ukrainian defenses along the border, Russia is unlikely to secure verifiable control of Dnipropetrovsk territory by June 30 under ISW's rigorous mapping standards.

The DeepStateMap similarly shows Russian forces within 2 km of the oblast border but does not indicate control of any Dnipropetrovsk settlements[2][16].  \n\nRussian claims of territorial gains in the oblast[14][21] have been refuted by Ukrainian officials and independent analysts[18][34]. ISW assesses current Russian operations near the border as part of ongoing efforts in Donetsk Oblast, not a dedicated offensive into Dnipropetrovsk[59]. Mandatory evacuations in frontline villages like Mezhova[75] indicate proximity to combat but do not constitute Russian control.  \n\nGiven the current rate of advance (14.3 km\u00b2/day)[46] and fortified Ukrainian defenses along the border, Russia is unlikely to secure verifiable control of Dnipropetrovsk territory by June 30 under ISW's rigorous mapping standards. No negotiated settlement transferring control appears imminent.\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.99, ID: 100956831542359738430417943946810501101213060494810573893628126673226680525220, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.01, ID: 72525931920618283565561832708314103214294645011710460337908351375734748459374, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.990 = 99.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Russia will capture territory in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast by June 30, 2025, based on the ISW map. The resolution depends on whether any part of Dnipropetrovsk is shaded red on the ISW map by the deadline. If not, it resolves to \"No\". They also mention using DeepStateMap if ISW is unavailable, and credible reporting as a last resort.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The provided timestamp is June 12, 2025. The deadline is June 30, so there's about 18 days left. The user provided several search results, mostly from ISW reports and other news sources. Let's go through them.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are multiple mentions of Russian advances towards the Donetsk-Dnipropetrovsk border. For example, result [2] from June 8 says Russian forces reached the border and are conducting operations in Dnipropetrovsk. However, Ukrainian sources deny this, calling it disinformation. Result [9] from June 9 mentions geolocated footage showing Russian advances to the administrative border. Similarly, result [10] on June 8 also discusses Russian claims of reaching the border. \n\nBut the ISW reports (like [2], [9], [10], [12]) indicate that while Russia claims advances, there's no geolocated evidence yet. The ISW assessment is that current activity is part of ongoing operations in Donetsk, not a new offensive into Dnipropetrovsk. However, by June 11 (result [16]), the Russian MoD claims their Eastern and Central Groupings have reached the border and are advancing into Dnipropetrovsk. Yet, Ukrainian officials still deny any presence in Dnipropetrovsk, stating fighting is only near the border (result [15], [17]).\n\nThe key here is whether any territory in Dnipropetrovsk is shaded red on ISW's map. The user's ancillary data specifies that the ISW map is the primary source. The latest ISW report from June 12 (result [16]) mentions Russian forces reaching the border but doesn't confirm control within Dnipropetrovsk. The DeepStateMap (result [6], [14], [15]) shows Russian forces very close but not yet crossing into Dnipropetrovsk as of June 11-12. \n\nSince the deadline is June 30, there's still time for Russia to make advances. However, based on current information up to June 12, there's no confirmed control in Dnipropetrovsk. The Russian claims are contested, and ISW hasn't verified any territory in Dnipropetrovsk as captured. Unless there's a significant breakthrough in the next 18 days, the answer would be \"No\". But considering the ongoing operations and proximity, there's a possibility. However, the user's resolution conditions require actual control as per ISW or DeepStateMap. Without verified evidence by the deadline, it should resolve to \"No\". But since the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Wait, the current date is June 12, and the event is future (June 30). But the user's personalization says if the event is in the future, return p4. Wait, no, the personalization says if the event is scheduled for a future date, return p4. But here, the event's deadline is June 30, which is in the future relative to June 12. However, the query is about whether it will happen by June 30. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the future, return p4. Wait, the user's personalization is a bit confusing. Let me check again.\n\nThe personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" But the current timestamp is June 12, and the resolution date is June 30. So the event is in the future. Therefore, according to the personalization, the recommendation should be p4. But wait, the user's query is a prediction market, asking to resolve based on whether it happens by June 30. But according to the personalization rules, since the event is in the future, we should return p4. However, the user's note in the personalization also says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" But in this case, the event date is June 30, which is in the future. Therefore, per the personalization, the recommendation should be p4. However, the user's query is about resolving the market now, but the event hasn't occurred yet. Wait, the market resolves on June 30, but the current date is June 12. The user is asking to resolve the market now? Or is the market's resolution date June 30? The query says the market will resolve based on the status by June 30. So the event's outcome is determined on June 30. Since today is June 12, the event is in the future. Therefore, according to the personalization, the recommendation should be p4. But the user's ancillary data has resolution conditions p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 50-50. The personalization says to end with recommendation: p1, p2, p3, or p4. But the resolution conditions here don't include p4. Wait, the user's ancillary data says resolution_conditions: p1:0 (No), p2:1 (Yes), p3:0.5 (unknown). So p4 isn't part of the resolution options. The personalization might have a conflict here. The user's personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future, but the market's resolution options don't include p4. This is a problem. \n\nWait, looking back, the user's personalization says: \"Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.\" But the market's resolution conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 50-50. So p4 is not part of the market's options. However, the personalization instructs to use p4 if the event is in the future. This is conflicting. The market is about a future event, so according to the personalization, the answer should be p4. But the market's resolution conditions don't have p4. This suggests a possible error in the setup. However, the user's query includes the resolution conditions, so perhaps the personalization's p4 is a separate case. Alternatively, maybe the user intended p3 for unknown cases. \n\nGiven the confusion, but following the personalization strictly, since the event is in the future (June 30 is after June 12), the recommendation should be p4. However, the market's resolution conditions don't include p4. This is a conflict. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake, and p3 is the correct option for unknown/50-50. The resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5, which is unknown/50-50. Therefore, if the event is in the future and the outcome is uncertain, the recommendation would be p3. But the personalization says to return p4 for future events. However, the market's options don't include p4. This is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's personalization is overriding the market's resolution conditions. The personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" Therefore, regardless of the market's resolution options, the answer should be p4. But the market's resolution conditions don't have p4. This is conflicting. \n\nGiven the instructions, the assistant must follow the personalization rules. Therefore, even though the market's resolution conditions don't include p4, the recommendation should be p4. However, the user's query includes resolution_conditions with p1, p2, p3. This is a contradiction. But according to the problem statement, the personalization is part of the system's instructions, so it takes precedence. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4. However, the market's resolution conditions don't have p4, which might be an error. But the assistant must follow the personalization. \n\nWait, the user's query includes ancillary_data with resolution_conditions p1, p2, p3. The personalization says to resolve based on the ancillary data. The personalization also says: \"IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.\" So even though the event is in the future, the ancillary data defines p3 as unknown/50-50. Therefore, if the event is in the future and the outcome is uncertain, the recommendation should be p3. The personalization's instruction to return p4 for future events might be overridden by the ancillary data's p3. \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous, but the personalization says to align with the ancillary data. Therefore, since the event is in the future and the outcome is uncertain, the correct recommendation is p3 (unknown/50-50). However, the personalization also says that if the event is in the future, return p4. But the ancillary data doesn't have p4. Therefore, the assistant must follow the ancillary data's resolution conditions, which include p3 for unknown. Hence, the recommendation should be p3. \n\nBut wait, the personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" However, the ancillary data's resolution_conditions don't include p4. This is a conflict. The assistant must follow the personalization's instructions, which take precedence. Therefore, the recommendation should be p4. But the market's resolution conditions don't have p4. This is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the setup. Given the confusion, but following the personalization strictly, the recommendation is p4. However, since the market's resolution conditions don't include p4, this might be an error. But the assistant must follow the system's instructions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the personalization's p4 is equivalent to the market's p3. But the personalization says p4 indicates the request cannot be resolved at this time, while the market's p3 is unknown/50-50. They are different. Therefore, the correct answer is p4, but the market doesn't have that option. This is a conflict. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but the personalization's instruction to return p4 for future events, and the event is in the future, the assistant should recommend p4. However, the market's resolution conditions don't include p4. This suggests an error in the market setup. But the assistant must follow the personalization. Therefore, the recommendation is p4. \n\nBut the user's query says the resolution_conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 0.5. There's no p4. Therefore, the assistant is in a dilemma. However, the personalization is part of the system's instructions, so it takes precedence. Therefore, the recommendation is p4. But the market doesn't have p4. This is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended p3 to cover future uncertainty. In that case, the recommendation would be p3. But the personalization says to use p4. This is conflicting. \n\nGiven the strictest interpretation, the personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. Therefore, despite the market's setup, the recommendation is p4. However, the market's resolution conditions don't include p4, which might be an error. But the assistant must follow the system's instructions. \n\nTherefore, the final recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

The user wants to know if Russia will capture territory in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast by June 30, 2025, based on the ISW map. The resolution depends on whether any part of Dnipropetrovsk is shaded red on the ISW map by the deadline. If not, it resolves to \"No\". They also mention using DeepStateMap if ISW is unavailable, and credible reporting as a last resort.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The provided timestamp is June 12, 2025. The deadline is June 30, so there's about 18 days left. The user provided several search results, mostly from ISW reports and other news sources. Let's go through them.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are multiple mentions of Russian advances towards the Donetsk-Dnipropetrovsk border. For example, result [2] from June 8 says Russian forces reached the border and are conducting operations in Dnipropetrovsk. However, Ukrainian sources deny this, calling it disinformation. Result [9] from June 9 mentions geolocated footage showing Russian advances to the administrative border. Similarly, result [10] on June 8 also discusses Russian claims of reaching the border. \n\nBut the ISW reports (like [2], [9], [10], [12]) indicate that while Russia claims advances, there's no geolocated evidence yet. The ISW assessment is that current activity is part of ongoing operations in Donetsk, not a new offensive into Dnipropetrovsk. However, by June 11 (result [16]), the Russian MoD claims their Eastern and Central Groupings have reached the border and are advancing into Dnipropetrovsk. Yet, Ukrainian officials still deny any presence in Dnipropetrovsk, stating fighting is only near the border (result [15], [17]).\n\nThe key here is whether any territory in Dnipropetrovsk is shaded red on ISW's map. The user's ancillary data specifies that the ISW map is the primary source. The latest ISW report from June 12 (result [16]) mentions Russian forces reaching the border but doesn't confirm control within Dnipropetrovsk. The DeepStateMap (result [6], [14], [15]) shows Russian forces very close but not yet crossing into Dnipropetrovsk as of June 11-12. \n\nSince the deadline is June 30, there's still time for Russia to make advances. However, based on current information up to June 12, there's no confirmed control in Dnipropetrovsk. The Russian claims are contested, and ISW hasn't verified any territory in Dnipropetrovsk as captured. Unless there's a significant breakthrough in the next 18 days, the answer would be \"No\". But considering the ongoing operations and proximity, there's a possibility. However, the user's resolution conditions require actual control as per ISW or DeepStateMap. Without verified evidence by the deadline, it should resolve to \"No\". But since the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Wait, the current date is June 12, and the event is future (June 30). But the user's personalization says if the event is in the future, return p4. Wait, no, the personalization says if the event is scheduled for a future date, return p4. But here, the event's deadline is June 30, which is in the future relative to June 12. However, the query is about whether it will happen by June 30. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the future, return p4. Wait, the user's personalization is a bit confusing. Let me check again.\n\nThe personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" But the current timestamp is June 12, and the resolution date is June 30. So the event is in the future. Therefore, according to the personalization, the recommendation should be p4. But wait, the user's query is a prediction market, asking to resolve based on whether it happens by June 30. But according to the personalization rules, since the event is in the future, we should return p4. However, the user's note in the personalization also says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" But in this case, the event date is June 30, which is in the future. Therefore, per the personalization, the recommendation should be p4. However, the user's query is about resolving the market now, but the event hasn't occurred yet. Wait, the market resolves on June 30, but the current date is June 12. The user is asking to resolve the market now? Or is the market's resolution date June 30? The query says the market will resolve based on the status by June 30. So the event's outcome is determined on June 30. Since today is June 12, the event is in the future. Therefore, according to the personalization, the recommendation should be p4. But the user's ancillary data has resolution conditions p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 50-50. The personalization says to end with recommendation: p1, p2, p3, or p4. But the resolution conditions here don't include p4. Wait, the user's ancillary data says resolution_conditions: p1:0 (No), p2:1 (Yes), p3:0.5 (unknown). So p4 isn't part of the resolution options. The personalization might have a conflict here. The user's personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future, but the market's resolution options don't include p4. This is a problem. \n\nWait, looking back, the user's personalization says: \"Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.\" But the market's resolution conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 50-50. So p4 is not part of the market's options. However, the personalization instructs to use p4 if the event is in the future. This is conflicting. The market is about a future event, so according to the personalization, the answer should be p4. But the market's resolution conditions don't have p4. This suggests a possible error in the setup. However, the user's query includes the resolution conditions, so perhaps the personalization's p4 is a separate case. Alternatively, maybe the user intended p3 for unknown cases. \n\nGiven the confusion, but following the personalization strictly, since the event is in the future (June 30 is after June 12), the recommendation should be p4. However, the market's resolution conditions don't include p4. This is a conflict. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake, and p3 is the correct option for unknown/50-50. The resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5, which is unknown/50-50. Therefore, if the event is in the future and the outcome is uncertain, the recommendation would be p3. But the personalization says to return p4 for future events. However, the market's options don't include p4. This is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's personalization is overriding the market's resolution conditions. The personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" Therefore, regardless of the market's resolution options, the answer should be p4. But the market's resolution conditions don't have p4. This is conflicting. \n\nGiven the instructions, the assistant must follow the personalization rules. Therefore, even though the market's resolution conditions don't include p4, the recommendation should be p4. However, the user's query includes resolution_conditions with p1, p2, p3. This is a contradiction. But according to the problem statement, the personalization is part of the system's instructions, so it takes precedence. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4. However, the market's resolution conditions don't have p4, which might be an error. But the assistant must follow the personalization. \n\nWait, the user's query includes ancillary_data with resolution_conditions p1, p2, p3. The personalization says to resolve based on the ancillary data. The personalization also says: \"IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.\" So even though the event is in the future, the ancillary data defines p3 as unknown/50-50. Therefore, if the event is in the future and the outcome is uncertain, the recommendation should be p3. The personalization's instruction to return p4 for future events might be overridden by the ancillary data's p3. \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous, but the personalization says to align with the ancillary data. Therefore, since the event is in the future and the outcome is uncertain, the correct recommendation is p3 (unknown/50-50). However, the personalization also says that if the event is in the future, return p4. But the ancillary data doesn't have p4. Therefore, the assistant must follow the ancillary data's resolution conditions, which include p3 for unknown. Hence, the recommendation should be p3. \n\nBut wait, the personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" However, the ancillary data's resolution_conditions don't include p4. This is a conflict. The assistant must follow the personalization's instructions, which take precedence. Therefore, the recommendation should be p4. But the market's resolution conditions don't have p4. This is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the setup. Given the confusion, but following the personalization strictly, the recommendation is p4. However, since the market's resolution conditions don't include p4, this might be an error. But the assistant must follow the system's instructions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the personalization's p4 is equivalent to the market's p3. But the personalization says p4 indicates the request cannot be resolved at this time, while the market's p3 is unknown/50-50. They are different. Therefore, the correct answer is p4, but the market doesn't have that option. This is a conflict. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but the personalization's instruction to return p4 for future events, and the event is in the future, the assistant should recommend p4. However, the market's resolution conditions don't include p4. This suggests an error in the market setup. But the assistant must follow the personalization. Therefore, the recommendation is p4. \n\nBut the user's query says the resolution_conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 0.5. There's no p4. Therefore, the assistant is in a dilemma. However, the personalization is part of the system's instructions, so it takes precedence. Therefore, the recommendation is p4. But the market doesn't have p4. This is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended p3 to cover future uncertainty. In that case, the recommendation would be p3. But the personalization says to use p4. This is conflicting. \n\nGiven the strictest interpretation, the personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. Therefore, despite the market's setup, the recommendation is p4. However, the market's resolution conditions don't include p4, which might be an error. But the assistant must follow the system's instructions. \n\nTherefore, the final recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.99, ID: 100956831542359738430417943946810501101213060494810573893628126673226680525220, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.01, ID: 72525931920618283565561832708314103214294645011710460337908351375734748459374, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

The current ISW assessment (source [3]) indicates no confirmed Russian control in Dnipropetrovsk. Satellite data shows artillery craters near the border but no actual territorial gains. Also, the DeepStateMap (source [11]) hasn't reported any red-shaded areas in Dnipropetrovsk as of June 12.\n\nThe Russian advances mentioned in sources [1], [2], [12] are contested and unconfirmed by independent sources. The Ukrainian military maintains that the front lines remain within Donetsk. Since the deadline is June 30, there's about two weeks left. However, the ISW's analysis suggests that Russian efforts are focused on Donetsk, not a major push into Dnipropetrovsk. \n\nConsidering the resolution conditions, unless there's a significant breakthrough in the next two weeks, which current reports don't indicate, the answer is likely \"No.\" The market sentiment might lean towards \"No\" given the lack of confirmed advances. Therefore, the recommendation should be p1 (No).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The user wants to know if Russia will capture territory in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast by June 30, 2025, based on the ISW map. The resolution depends on whether any part of the oblast is shaded red on that map by the deadline. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current status. The search results mention that as of June 12, 2025, Russian forces are attempting to advance towards the Dnipropetrovsk border but haven't crossed it yet. The ISW reports (sources [3], [8], [10]) state that while there's fighting near the border, the activity is part of ongoing operations in Donetsk, not a new offensive into Dnipropetrovsk. Ukrainian officials (sources [7], [18]) deny any Russian incursions into the oblast, calling such claims disinformation.\n\nThe user's ancillary data specifies that the ISW map is the primary source. The current ISW assessment (source [3]) indicates no confirmed Russian control in Dnipropetrovsk. Satellite data shows artillery craters near the border but no actual territorial gains. Also, the DeepStateMap (source [11]) hasn't reported any red-shaded areas in Dnipropetrovsk as of June 12.\n\nThe Russian advances mentioned in sources [1], [2], [12] are contested and unconfirmed by independent sources. The Ukrainian military maintains that the front lines remain within Donetsk. Since the deadline is June 30, there's about two weeks left. However, the ISW's analysis suggests that Russian efforts are focused on Donetsk, not a major push into Dnipropetrovsk. \n\nConsidering the resolution conditions, unless there's a significant breakthrough in the next two weeks, which current reports don't indicate, the answer is likely \"No.\" The market sentiment might lean towards \"No\" given the lack of confirmed advances. Therefore, the recommendation should be p1 (No).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.99, ID: 100956831542359738430417943946810501101213060494810573893628126673226680525220, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.01, ID: 72525931920618283565561832708314103214294645011710460337908351375734748459374, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.990 = 99.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The resolution depends on whether any part of that oblast is shaded red by the deadline. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current status as of June 12, 2025. The search results mention that Russian forces claimed to have reached the Donetsk-Dnipropetrovsk border and are conducting operations there. However, Ukrainian sources and ISW reports from June 8 and 9 [1][5][13][22] state that there's no geolocated evidence of Russian advances into Dnipropetrovsk. The Ukrainian military denies these claims, calling them disinformation. \n\nLooking at the ISW assessments, they forecasted in November 2024 that Russia might advance into southeastern Dnipropetrovsk to cut Ukrainian supply lines, but as of June 8, they assess that current activity is part of ongoing operations in Donetsk, not a new offensive into Dnipropetrovsk [1][33]. Satellite data shows artillery activity near the border but not actual control. \n\nDeepStateMap, the backup source, shows Russian forces close to the border but not within Dnipropetrovsk as of June 10 [16][20]. The \"gray zone\" has expanded, but the \"red zone\" (Russian control) remains about 2 km away [34]. \n\nThere's also mention of Russian forces aiming to capture more territory by 2026, but the current rate of advance is slow [15][22]. The user's deadline is June 30, which is only 18 days away. Given the lack of confirmed advances and the fortified Ukrainian positions, it's unlikely Russia can secure and hold territory in Dnipropetrovsk by then. \n\nAdditionally, the market resolution notes that negotiated settlements giving de jure control don't count unless actual control is established. There's no mention of any such negotiations nearing completion. \n\nConsidering all this, the most probable outcome is \"No\" (p1). However, since there's some conflicting claims and ongoing operations, but no verified control, the recommendation should align with the available evidence against Russian advancement into Dnipropetrovsk by the deadline.\n</think>\n\n**recommendation: p1** \n\n**Justification:**  \nAs of June 12, 2025, ISW and independent analysts confirm that **no Russian-controlled territory in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast is shaded red on the ISW map**, despite Russian claims of advances. Key points:  \n\n1. **Geolocation Evidence**: ISW explicitly states it has \"not observed geolocated evidence\" of Russian forces crossing the Donetsk-Dnipropetrovsk border, and Ukrainian officials consistently deny such advances as disinformation[1][5][13][22]. Satellite data shows artillery activity near the border but no confirmed Russian control[1][34].  \n\n2. **DeepStateMap Status**: As of June 10, the closest Russian positions remain ~2 km from the Dnipropetrovsk border, with a \"gray zone\" (contested area) but no red-shaded territory[16][20][34].  \n\n3. **Operational Realities**: Russian forces are advancing at a rate of ~30-50 km over 15 months in Donetsk Oblast[15][22], making it highly unlikely they will secure and hold territory in Dnipropetrovsk within the remaining 18 days. ISW assesses current activity as localized probing, not a sustained offensive[1][33].  \n\n4. **Negotiated Settlement Clause**: No credible reports indicate imminent diplomatic agreements granting Russia control of Dnipropetrovsk.  \n\nWhile Russian forces may continue tactical probes, the absence of verified territorial gains and the short timeline strongly favor a \"No\" resolution.",

The user wants to know if Russia will capture territory in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast by June 30, 2025, based on the ISW map. The resolution depends on whether any part of that oblast is shaded red by the deadline. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current status as of June 12, 2025. The search results mention that Russian forces claimed to have reached the Donetsk-Dnipropetrovsk border and are conducting operations there. However, Ukrainian sources and ISW reports from June 8 and 9 [1][5][13][22] state that there's no geolocated evidence of Russian advances into Dnipropetrovsk. The Ukrainian military denies these claims, calling them disinformation. \n\nLooking at the ISW assessments, they forecasted in November 2024 that Russia might advance into southeastern Dnipropetrovsk to cut Ukrainian supply lines, but as of June 8, they assess that current activity is part of ongoing operations in Donetsk, not a new offensive into Dnipropetrovsk [1][33]. Satellite data shows artillery activity near the border but not actual control. \n\nDeepStateMap, the backup source, shows Russian forces close to the border but not within Dnipropetrovsk as of June 10 [16][20]. The \"gray zone\" has expanded, but the \"red zone\" (Russian control) remains about 2 km away [34]. \n\nThere's also mention of Russian forces aiming to capture more territory by 2026, but the current rate of advance is slow [15][22]. The user's deadline is June 30, which is only 18 days away. Given the lack of confirmed advances and the fortified Ukrainian positions, it's unlikely Russia can secure and hold territory in Dnipropetrovsk by then. \n\nAdditionally, the market resolution notes that negotiated settlements giving de jure control don't count unless actual control is established. There's no mention of any such negotiations nearing completion. \n\nConsidering all this, the most probable outcome is \"No\" (p1). However, since there's some conflicting claims and ongoing operations, but no verified control, the recommendation should align with the available evidence against Russian advancement into Dnipropetrovsk by the deadline.\n</think>\n\n**recommendation: p1** \n\n**Justification:**  \nAs of June 12, 2025, ISW and independent analysts confirm that **no Russian-controlled territory in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast is shaded red on the ISW map**, despite Russian claims of advances. Key points:  \n\n1. **Geolocation Evidence**: ISW explicitly states it has \"not observed geolocated evidence\" of Russian forces crossing the Donetsk-Dnipropetrovsk border, and Ukrainian officials consistently deny such advances as disinformation[1][5][13][22]. Satellite data shows artillery activity near the border but no confirmed Russian control[1][34].  \n\n2. **DeepStateMap Status**: As of June 10, the closest Russian positions remain ~2 km from the Dnipropetrovsk border, with a \"gray zone\" (contested area) but no red-shaded territory[16][20][34].  \n\n3. **Operational Realities**: Russian forces are advancing at a rate of ~30-50 km over 15 months in Donetsk Oblast[15][22], making it highly unlikely they will secure and hold territory in Dnipropetrovsk within the remaining 18 days. ISW assesses current activity as localized probing, not a sustained offensive[1][33].  \n\n4. **Negotiated Settlement Clause**: No credible reports indicate imminent diplomatic agreements granting Russia control of Dnipropetrovsk.  \n\nWhile Russian forces may continue tactical probes, the absence of verified territorial gains and the short timeline strongly favor a \"No\" resolution.\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.99, ID: 100956831542359738430417943946810501101213060494810573893628126673226680525220, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.01, ID: 72525931920618283565561832708314103214294645011710460337908351375734748459374, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.990 = 99.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe perplexity solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: perplexity\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\"), college football (e.g., \"What was the score of the Alabama game last Saturday?\"), college basketball (e.g., \"What was Duke's score in their last game?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",
