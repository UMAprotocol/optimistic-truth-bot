Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Bitcoin Up or Down - June 14, 8 AM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for BTC/USDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTC/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTC/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 551818\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality.

Recommendation found: p3.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p3\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.0055, ID: 37577133369910831399335507251135420537669318886547727510198783240698131040733, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.9945, ID: 12849174738888742283239510957478735163223246491950477661793859770471202088482, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

I need you to generate code to solve the following prediction market question:\n\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Bitcoin Up or Down - June 14, 8 AM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for BTC/USDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTC/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTC/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 551818\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Bitcoin Up or Down - June 14, 8 AM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for BTC/USDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTC/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTC/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 551818\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749907203 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-14 13:20:03 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p3. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Configure logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nconsole_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\nconsole_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nconsole_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\nlogger.addHandler(console_handler)\n\ndef get_btc_price_change(date_str, hour, minute, timezone_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches the percentage change for the BTC/USDT pair for the 1-hour candle starting at the specified time.\n\n    Args:\n        date_str: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format\n        hour: Hour in 24-hour format\n        minute: Minute\n        timezone_str: Timezone string\n\n    Returns:\n        Percentage change as float or None if data cannot be fetched.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        tz = pytz.timezone(timezone_str)\n        time_str = f\"{hour:02d}:{minute:02d}:00\"\n        target_time_local = tz.localize(datetime.strptime(f\"{date_str} {time_str}\", \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"))\n        target_time_utc = target_time_local.astimezone(timezone.utc)\n        start_time_ms = int(target_time_utc.timestamp() * 1000) - 3600000  # 1 hour in milliseconds\n\n        api_url = \"https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines\"\n        params = {\n            \"symbol\": \"BTCUSDT\",\n            \"interval\": \"1h\",\n            \"limit\": 1,\n            \"startTime\": start_time_ms,\n            \"endTime\": start_time_ms + 3600000\n        }\n\n        response = requests.get(api_url, params=params)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n\n        if data:\n            open_price = float(data[0][1])\n            close_price = float(data[0][4])\n            price_change_percent = ((close_price - open_price) / open_price) * 100\n            return price_change_percent\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Failed to fetch or parse data: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to determine if the BTC/USDT price went up or down at the specified time.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Specific date and time for the query\n    date_str = \"2025-06-14\"\n    hour = 8\n    minute = 0\n    timezone_str = \"US/Eastern\"\n\n    price_change_percent = get_btc_price_change(date_str, hour, minute, timezone_str)\n\n    if price_change_percent is None:\n        print(\"recommendation: p3\")  # Unknown/50-50 if data cannot be fetched\n    elif price_change_percent >= 0:\n        print(\"recommendation: p2\")  # Up\n    else:\n        print(\"recommendation: p1\")  # Down\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p3\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve whether Bitcoin's price went up or down based on the 1-hour candle starting June 14 at 8 AM ET on Binance's BTC/USDT pair. The current timestamp is June 14, 2025, 1:20 PM UTC. First, I need to convert 8 AM ET to UTC. ET is UTC-4, so 8 AM ET is 12 PM UTC. The 1-hour candle from 12 PM to 1 PM UTC would have closed at 1 PM UTC. Since the current time is 1:20 PM UTC, the candle is closed, and the data should be available.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention Binance's BTC/USDT pair. For example, result [61] shows the live price chart, and result [62] is the direct Binance trading page. However, specific data for the exact hour might not be explicitly listed. The historical data from CoinGecko (result [1]) provides daily closes but not hourly. The Kaggle dataset (result [5]) includes 4-hour intervals, which isn't granular enough. \n\nResult [45] from Coindesk mentions Bitcoin's price around $105,101 on June 14, but it's a broader market analysis. Result [19] from Latestly states Bitcoin's price at $105,085.82 on June 14, 2025, at 2:52 PM IST, which is 9:22 AM UTC, not covering the 12 PM UTC candle. \n\nThe critical point is whether the 1-hour candle's percentage change is >=0. Without explicit data for that exact hour, I might need to infer from nearby data. However, the user specified using Binance's data as the resolution source. Since the current time is past the candle's close, the change should be determinable. \n\nAssuming the data is available (even if not directly in the provided results), the correct approach is to check Binance's BTC/USDT 1-hour candle for 12 PM UTC. If the close is higher than the open, resolve to Up (p2). If not, Down (p1). Since the user's personalization instructs to use the specified URL and current timestamp, and the event date is in the past, I should resolve based on the most probable outcome. \n\nHowever, without explicit data in the provided context, I might have to default to p4 (cannot resolve). But the event date is in the past, and the user's instruction says if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The query's ancillary data defines p2 as Up if change >=0. If the price at 1 PM UTC is higher than at 12 PM, it's Up. \n\nLooking at result [45], Bitcoin's price was around $105,101, but the exact hourly movement isn't clear. If I can't find the exact percentage change, but given the market's general movement and the time passed, it's safer to check if the close was higher. If the provided sources don't have the exact data, but the user insists on Binance's data, and the current time is after the event, I should resolve based on available info. \n\nWait, result [45] mentions Bitcoin dipped to $104,220 overnight but rebounded. The 1 PM UTC candle might have shown a slight increase. If the close was higher than the open, then Up. Without explicit data, but given the instructions, if the event is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, the user might expect me to infer from nearby data. \n\nAlternatively, result [19] states Bitcoin's price dropped slightly to $105,085.82 on June 14, but that's at 2:52 PM IST (9:22 AM UTC), which is before the 12 PM UTC candle. Result [45] from Coindesk, timestamped 9:55 AM UTC on June 14, mentions Bitcoin at $105,101, but again, not the specific hour. \n\nSince the exact data isn't present in the provided search results, but the event is in the past, and per the user's instructions, if no verifiable info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. However, the user's personalization says to heavily bias towards the provided URLs. The Binance API docs (results [2], [6], [9], [12]) explain how to get kline data, but the actual data isn't in the context. \n\nGiven the strict instructions to use only the provided search results and the current timestamp, and since the event time has passed, but the specific candle's data isn't present, I might have to conclude that there's no verifiable information in the provided context. However, the user's personalization also says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. \n\nBut without the actual percentage change from Binance, it's uncertain. However, looking at the Coindesk article (result [45]), Bitcoin's price was around $105,101, and the price action was relatively tight, suggesting minimal change. If the 1-hour candle had a close equal to or higher than the open, it's Up. If not, Down. Without explicit data, but given the market's stability mentioned, perhaps the change was >=0. \n\nAlternatively, if the price was $105,101 at 9:55 AM UTC and the 12 PM UTC candle might have a slight increase. But this is speculative. Since the user requires strict adherence to Binance's data and the resolution source is the change value displayed on their graph, and the data isn't in the provided context, I might have to default to p4. However, the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nWait, the current timestamp is June 14, 1:20 PM UTC. The candle closed at 1 PM UTC, 20 minutes prior. The data should be available, but the provided search results don't include it. Therefore, according to the rules, if no verifiable information, answer as best as possible. Since the user's query is about the 1-hour candle change on Binance, and the data isn't present in the context, but the event is past, I should check if any sources mention the price movement around that time. \n\nResult [45] mentions Bitcoin was at $105,101, down 0.22% over 24 hours, but that's a daily change. The 1-hour specific change isn't there. Therefore, without explicit data, but the event is past, I have to assume the most probable outcome. However, the user's instructions say to use the provided URLs. Since the provided URLs don't have the exact 1-hour change, I can't verify. Therefore, the correct resolution is p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nBut the ancillary data says p1 is Down, p2 is Up. If I can't determine, maybe p3 (50-50), but the user's personalization says p3 is 0.5, but the resolution conditions here have p3 as 0.5. Wait, the resolution_conditions are p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: unknown/50-50. The user's instruction says if no info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But without data, it's impossible. Therefore, the recommendation is p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But how to determine that? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the change was 0 or positive. If the price was stable, maybe 0, which is >=0, so Up. But without data, it's a guess. Given the strict rules, if the data isn't present in the provided context, the assistant should answer as best as possible. Since the query is about Binance's BTC/USDT and the time has passed, but no data in the context, the assistant can't resolve and should return p4. However, the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without any data, it's impossible. \n\nWait, the current time is 1:20 PM UTC, and the candle closed at 1 PM UTC. The data should be available, but the provided search results don't include it. Therefore, according to the rules, if the information isn't available in the provided sources, answer as best as possible. Since the user insists on using Binance's data, and it's not here, perhaps the correct answer is p4. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, without any data, it's impossible to know. \n\nGiven the conflict, but the event is past, and the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, but without data, I think the correct answer is p4. However, the user might expect me to look for clues. For example, result [45] mentions Bitcoin's price was $105,101, down 0.22% over 24h, but that's daily. The 1-hour change could be different. If the 1-hour candle had a positive change, it's Up. But without explicit data, I can't be sure. Therefore, the safest recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

The Binance API docs (results [2], [6], [9], [12]) explain how to get kline data, but the actual data isn't in the context. \n\nGiven the strict instructions to use only the provided search results and the current timestamp, and since the event time has passed, but the specific candle's data isn't present, I might have to conclude that there's no verifiable information in the provided context. However, the user's personalization also says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. \n\nBut without the actual percentage change from Binance, it's uncertain. However, looking at the Coindesk article (result [45]), Bitcoin's price was around $105,101, and the price action was relatively tight, suggesting minimal change. If the 1-hour candle had a close equal to or higher than the open, it's Up. If not, Down. Without explicit data, but given the market's stability mentioned, perhaps the change was >=0. \n\nAlternatively, if the price was $105,101 at 9:55 AM UTC and the 12 PM UTC candle might have a slight increase. But this is speculative. Since the user requires strict adherence to Binance's data and the resolution source is the change value displayed on their graph, and the data isn't in the provided context, I might have to default to p4. However, the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nWait, the current timestamp is June 14, 1:20 PM UTC. The candle closed at 1 PM UTC, 20 minutes prior. The data should be available, but the provided search results don't include it. Therefore, according to the rules, if no verifiable information, answer as best as possible. Since the user's query is about the 1-hour candle change on Binance, and the data isn't present in the context, but the event is past, I should check if any sources mention the price movement around that time. \n\nResult [45] mentions Bitcoin was at $105,101, down 0.22% over 24 hours, but that's a daily change. The 1-hour specific change isn't there. Therefore, without explicit data, but the event is past, I have to assume the most probable outcome. However, the user's instructions say to use the provided URLs. Since the provided URLs don't have the exact 1-hour change, I can't verify. Therefore, the correct resolution is p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nBut the ancillary data says p1 is Down, p2 is Up. If I can't determine, maybe p3 (50-50), but the user's personalization says p3 is 0.5, but the resolution conditions here have p3 as 0.5. Wait, the resolution_conditions are p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: unknown/50-50. The user's instruction says if no info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But without data, it's impossible. Therefore, the recommendation is p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But how to determine that? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the change was 0 or positive. If the price was stable, maybe 0, which is >=0, so Up. But without data, it's a guess. Given the strict rules, if the data isn't present in the provided context, the assistant should answer as best as possible. Since the query is about Binance's BTC/USDT and the time has passed, but no data in the context, the assistant can't resolve and should return p4. However, the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without any data, it's impossible. \n\nWait, the current time is 1:20 PM UTC, and the candle closed at 1 PM UTC. The data should be available, but the provided search results don't include it. Therefore, according to the rules, if the information isn't available in the provided sources, answer as best as possible. Since the user insists on using Binance's data, and it's not here, perhaps the correct answer is p4. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, without any data, it's impossible to know. \n\nGiven the conflict, but the event is past, and the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, but without data, I think the correct answer is p4. However, the user might expect me to look for clues. For example, result [45] mentions Bitcoin's price was $105,101, down 0.22% over 24h, but that's daily. The 1-hour change could be different. If the 1-hour candle had a positive change, it's Up. But without explicit data, I can't be sure. Therefore, the safest recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.0055, ID: 37577133369910831399335507251135420537669318886547727510198783240698131040733, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.9945, ID: 12849174738888742283239510957478735163223246491950477661793859770471202088482, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market based on whether the BTC/USDT 1-hour candle starting June 14, 8 AM ET (which is June 14, 12 PM UTC) had a percentage change greater than or equal to 0. The resolution depends on Binance's data for that specific candle.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the exact time window. The candle in question starts at 8 AM ET on June 14. Since ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, 8 AM ET converts to 12 PM UTC. The 1-hour candle would cover from 12:00:00 to 12:59:59.999 UTC on June 14, 2025.\n\nNext, I need to check the provided search results for data around that time. The search results include sources like Cryptodatadownload, GitHub repositories with historical data, and recent technical analysis from CentralCharts. The most recent data point in the search results is from June 14, 13:20:03 UTC, which is after the candle's close. The technical analysis from CentralCharts (source 6) mentions the BTC/USDT price at 103,976.13 USDT as of June 13, but that's a day before the target date. \n\nLooking at the CoinGecko historical data (source 5), the entry for June 14 shows a closing price of N/A, but June 13's close is $106,046. However, this data might not be granular enough for a 1-hour candle. The GitHub repositories (sources 2, 3, 7, 10, 14) provide code and datasets, but the latest commit mentioned is from 2025-04-25, which might not include the specific hour needed. \n\nThe Binance API documentation (sources 8, 9, 11, 13, 15) explains how to fetch klines, but without real-time API access here, I have to rely on the provided search results. The CentralCharts analysis (source 6) from June 13 mentions a bearish trend but doesn't cover June 14's data. \n\nSince the current timestamp is June 14, 13:20 UTC, the 12 PM UTC candle should have closed by 1 PM UTC. However, none of the provided sources explicitly show the percentage change for that exact hour. The absence of direct data points and the reliance on delayed or incomplete datasets in the search results mean I can't verify the exact percentage change from Binance's finalized data. \n\nGiven the instructions, if no verifiable data is available, I should assume the most probable outcome based on ancillary data. The market conditions define \"Up\" as a change \u22650. Without concrete data, but considering the previous day's bearish trend and the lack of positive movement indicators in the available sources, it's uncertain. However, the user's additional instruction mentions to try again if the first attempt was p4. The previous response was p4, so now I need to infer. \n\nSince the market resolution depends on Binance's displayed change, and assuming the data isn't available yet due to the short time since the candle closed, the safest recommendation remains p4 (unknown). But the user wants a different approach. Alternatively, if the candle's close is higher than the open, it's \"Up\". If the close is lower, \"Down\". Without the actual data, but perhaps using the latest price from CoinGecko on June 14 (which is N/A for close, but the previous day's close was $106,046), but this isn't helpful. \n\nAlternatively, the CentralCharts analysis (source 6) on June 13 mentions a price of 103,976.13, but that's a day prior. If the price remained around that level without significant movement, the change might be near zero. However, this is speculative. \n\nGiven the lack of verifiable data in the provided sources and the requirement to avoid p4, but the need to follow the ancillary data, the most probable outcome based on the conditions (if no data, assume p3: 50-50). However, the ancillary data defines p3 as 0.5, which might correspond to unknown. But the user's instruction says to avoid p4. Wait, the resolution_conditions are p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: 0.5 (unknown/50-50). Since the data isn't available, the correct recommendation is p4, but the user says to try again. However, according to the instructions, if the event date is in the past and no data is available, but the date has passed, assume the most probable outcome. If the event is on the same day but the time hasn't passed, it's future. Here, the event time was 8 AM ET (12 PM UTC) on June 14, and the current time is 1:20 PM UTC, so the candle has closed. But without data, I can't confirm. Therefore, the recommendation should be p4 as the data isn't available in the provided sources. However, the user insists on a different approach. Maybe check the GitHub data (source 2) which has a CSV up to 2019, which is outdated. The other sources don't have the specific hour. Therefore, despite the user's request, the correct answer remains p4 due to insufficient data.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749907203 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-14 13:20:03 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step.

If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Your task is to analyze the provided query and decide which AI solver is best suited to handle it.\n\nAvailable solvers: perplexity\n\nSolver descriptions:\n- perplexity: Uses the Perplexity AI search engine to find information online to answer general questions. Best for:\n  * Historical data and events\n  * General knowledge questions requiring context\n  * Questions needing interpretation of complex information\n  * Has knowledge cutoff and may not have very recent information\n\n- code_runner: Executes code to fetch real-time data from specific APIs. Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Currently available data sources based on API keys:\n    - MLB (Major League Baseball) data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Bitcoin Up or Down - June 14, 8 AM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for BTC/USDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTC/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTC/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 551818\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.
