Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Available Crypto Data Sources:\n    - Binance: Provides cryptocurrency price data for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies\n  * Available Sports Data Sources:\n    - Sports Data IO - MLB (baseball): MLB baseball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NBA (basketball): NBA basketball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NFL (football): NFL football scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NHL (hockey): NHL hockey scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - CFB (college football): College Football (NCAA) scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - CBB (college basketball): College Basketball (NCAA) scores, statistics, and game data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Bitcoin Dominance Up or Down in May?, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the \"Close\" percentage for the TradingView 1 minute candle for BTC.D 01 May '25 00:00 in the ET timezone is lower than the final \"Close\" percentage for the 31 May '25 23:59 ET candle.\nThis market will resolve to \"Down\" if the \"Close\" percentage for the TradingView 1 minute candle for BTC.D 01 May '25 00:00 in the ET timezone is higher than the final \"Close\" percentage for the 31 May '25 23:59 ET candle.\nIf the final \"Close\" percentage for both of these candles is exactly equal on TradingView, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nThe resolution source for this market is TradingView, specifically the BTC.D \"Close\" prices currently available at https://fr.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=CRYPTOCAP%3ABTC.D with \"1m\" and \"Candles\" selected on the top bar.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the percentage according to TradingView BTC.D, not according to other sources or spot markets.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\"), college football (e.g., \"What was the score of the Alabama game last Saturday?\"), college basketball (e.g., \"What was Duke's score in their last game?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",

Query Type Specific Information:\n\n   Cryptocurrency Data Sources:\n   - Binance:\n     * primary: https://api.binance.com/api/v3\n     * proxy: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\n     * RECOMMENDED: Use this proxy endpoint first for better reliability\n     * Example: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy?symbol=BTCUSDT&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime=TIMESTAMP&endTime=TIMESTAMP\n\n     * CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Since a proxy endpoint is provided, you MUST implement a fallback mechanism:\n       1. Try the proxy endpoint first (better reliability)\n       2. If proxy fails (timeout, error response, etc.), automatically fall back to the primary endpoint\n       3. Your code MUST handle this gracefully with try/except blocks\n\n     Example fallback code structure:\n     ```python\n     def get_data(symbol, start_time, end_time):\n         try:\n             # First try the proxy endpoint\n             response = requests.get(f\"{proxy_url}?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n         except Exception as e:\n             print(f\"Proxy endpoint failed: {str(e)}, falling back to primary endpoint\")\n             # Fall back to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n             response = requests.get(f\"{primary_url}/klines?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n     ```\n     \n6. NEVER include actual API key values in the code, always load them from environment variables.\n\n7. IMPORTANT FOR ALL DATA SOURCES: If a proxy endpoint is provided alongside a primary endpoint, you MUST implement the fallback mechanism described above. This is critical for reliability:\n   - Always try the proxy endpoint first\n   - If the proxy fails, fall back to the primary endpoint\n   - Use appropriate timeout values (10 seconds recommended)\n   - Include proper error handling with try/except blocks\n\nThe code should be completely self-contained and runnable with no arguments.\n\n\nHere's a complete code example that shows how to solve this type of problem:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Note: Binance public API doesn't require an API key for basic price queries\n# However, if we need rate limits increased or private endpoints, we would use these:\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\nBINANCE_API_SECRET = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\")\n\n# Sensitive data patterns to mask in logs\nSENSITIVE_PATTERNS = [\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_KEY\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    #

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749046647 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-04 14:17:27 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# API keys loaded from environment variables\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\n\n# Configure logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n\n# Binance API URLs\nPRIMARY_BINANCE_API_URL = \"https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines\"\nPROXY_BINANCE_API_URL = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\"\n\ndef fetch_price(symbol, start_time, end_time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches the price from Binance API with a fallback to a proxy server.\n    \"\"\"\n    params = {\n        \"symbol\": symbol,\n        \"interval\": \"1m\",\n        \"limit\": 1,\n        \"startTime\": start_time,\n        \"endTime\": end_time\n    }\n    \n    try:\n        # Try fetching from the proxy first\n        response = requests.get(PROXY_BINANCE_API_URL, params=params, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n        if data:\n            return float(data[0][4])  # Close price\n    except Exception as e:\n        logging.warning(f\"Proxy failed with error: {e}.

Recommendation found: p2.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p2\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0, ID: 112325230309253779991554951608909492693689705537149970118166067432167055749220, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 1, ID: 23349657146262485037845431405429458404333424518340027566996285466937081533622, Winner: Yes\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Available Data Sources Information:\n   ALL AVAILABLE API CONFIGURATIONS:\n   - Binance (Category: crypto):\n     * API Key: BINANCE_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.binance.com/api/v3\n     * proxy endpoint: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\n   - Sports Data IO - MLB (Category: sports, Subcategory: baseball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb\n   - Sports Data IO - NBA (Category: sports, Subcategory: basketball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NBA_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nba\n   - Sports Data IO - NFL (Category: sports, Subcategory: football):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NFL_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nfl\n   - Sports Data IO - NHL (Category: sports, Subcategory: hockey):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nhl\n   - Sports Data IO - CFB (Category: sports, Subcategory: college football):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_CFB_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/cfb\n   - Sports Data IO - CBB (Category: sports, Subcategory: college basketball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_CBB_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/cbb\n\n5. Query Type Specific Information:\n\n   Cryptocurrency Data Sources:\n   - Binance:\n     * primary: https://api.binance.com/api/v3\n     * proxy: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\n     * RECOMMENDED: Use this proxy endpoint first for better reliability\n     * Example: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy?symbol=BTCUSDT&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime=TIMESTAMP&endTime=TIMESTAMP\n\n     * CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Since a proxy endpoint is provided, you MUST implement a fallback mechanism:\n       1. Try the proxy endpoint first (better reliability)\n       2. If proxy fails (timeout, error response, etc.), automatically fall back to the primary endpoint\n       3. Your code MUST handle this gracefully with try/except blocks\n\n     Example fallback code structure:\n     ```python\n     def get_data(symbol, start_time, end_time):\n         try:\n             # First try the proxy endpoint\n             response = requests.get(f\"{proxy_url}?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n         except Exception as e:\n             print(f\"Proxy endpoint failed: {str(e)}, falling back to primary endpoint\")\n             # Fall back to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n             response = requests.get(f\"{primary_url}/klines?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n     ```\n     \n6. NEVER include actual API key values in the code, always load them from environment variables.\n\n7. IMPORTANT FOR ALL DATA SOURCES: If a proxy endpoint is provided alongside a primary endpoint, you MUST implement the fallback mechanism described above. This is critical for reliability:\n   - Always try the proxy endpoint first\n   - If the proxy fails, fall back to the primary endpoint\n   - Use appropriate timeout values (10 seconds recommended)\n   - Include proper error handling with try/except blocks\n\nThe code should be completely self-contained and runnable with no arguments.\n\n\nHere's a complete code example that shows how to solve this type of problem:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Note: Binance public API doesn't require an API key for basic price queries\n# However, if we need rate limits increased or private endpoints, we would use these:\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\nBINANCE_API_SECRET = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\")\n\n# Sensitive data patterns to mask in logs\nSENSITIVE_PATTERNS = [\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_KEY\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    #

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749046647 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-04 14:17:27 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please ensure the solver uses the correct data source as specified in the query (TradingView for BTC.D 'Close' prices) and verify alignment with market sentiment before making a recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport os\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport pytz\nimport logging\n\n# Load environment variables\nload_dotenv()\n\n# API keys loaded from environment variables\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\n\n# Logging configuration\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\nlogger = logging.getLogger()\n\n# API URLs\nPRIMARY_API_URL = \"https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines\"\nPROXY_API_URL = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\"\n\ndef fetch_data_from_api(symbol, interval, start_time, end_time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches data from the Binance API with a fallback to a proxy server.\n    \"\"\"\n    params = {\n        \"symbol\": symbol,\n        \"interval\": interval,\n        \"limit\": 1,\n        \"startTime\": start_time,\n        \"endTime\": end_time\n    }\n    \n    try:\n        # Try fetching data from the proxy API first\n        response = requests.get(PROXY_API_URL, params=params, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n        if data:\n            return float(data[0][4])  # Close price\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Proxy API failed, error: {e}\")\n        # Fallback to the primary API if proxy fails\n        try:\n            response = requests.get(PRIMARY_API_URL, params=params, timeout=10)\n            response.raise_for_status()\n            data = response.json()\n            if data:\n                return float(data[0][4])  # Close price\n        except Exception as e:\n            logger.error(f\"Primary API failed, error: {e}\")\n            raise ConnectionError(\"Both primary and proxy APIs failed.\")\n\ndef convert_to_utc_timestamp(date_str, time_str, timezone_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts local time to UTC timestamp.\n    \"\"\"\n    local_tz = pytz.timezone(timezone_str)\n    local_time = datetime.strptime(f\"{date_str} {time_str}\", \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\")\n    local_dt = local_tz.localize(local_time, is_dst=None)\n    utc_dt = local_dt.astimezone(pytz.utc)\n    return int(utc_dt.timestamp() * 1000)\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        # Define the symbol and interval\n        symbol = \"BTC.D\"\n        interval = \"1m\"\n        \n        # Define the start and end times\n        start_time_1 = convert_to_utc_timestamp(\"2025-05-01\", \"00:00\", \"US/Eastern\")\n        end_time_1 = start_time_1 + 60000  # 1 minute later in milliseconds\n        \n        start_time_2 = convert_to_utc_timestamp(\"2025-05-31\", \"23:59\", \"US/Eastern\")\n        end_time_2 = start_time_2 + 60000  # 1 minute later in milliseconds\n        \n        # Fetch close prices\n        close_price_start = fetch_data_from_api(symbol, interval, start_time_1, end_time_1)\n        close_price_end = fetch_data_from_api(symbol, interval, start_time_2, end_time_2)\n        \n        # Determine the resolution\n        if close_price_start < close_price_end:\n            recommendation = \"p2\"  # Up\n        elif close_price_start > close_price_end:\n            recommendation = \"p1\"  # Down\n        else:\n            recommendation = \"p3\"  # 50-50\n        \n        print(f\"recommendation: {recommendation}\")\n        \n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        print(\"recommendation: p4\")  # Unable to resolve\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p4\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease write Python code that will gather the necessary data to answer this question definitively.\n\nIMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:\n1. DO NOT use command-line arguments. Extract all necessary information from the question itself.\n2. Load environment variables from .env files using the python-dotenv package.\n3. For API keys, use the following environment variables:\n   - BINANCE_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_CBB_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_CFB_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_NBA_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_NFL_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\n\n4. Available Data Sources Information:\n   ALL AVAILABLE API CONFIGURATIONS:\n   - Binance (Category: crypto):\n     * API Key: BINANCE_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.binance.com/api/v3\n     * proxy endpoint: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\n   - Sports Data IO - MLB (Category: sports, Subcategory: baseball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb\n   - Sports Data IO - NBA (Category: sports, Subcategory: basketball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NBA_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nba\n   - Sports Data IO - NFL (Category: sports, Subcategory: football):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NFL_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nfl\n   - Sports Data IO - NHL (Category: sports, Subcategory: hockey):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nhl\n   - Sports Data IO - CFB (Category: sports, Subcategory: college football):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_CFB_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/cfb\n   - Sports Data IO - CBB (Category: sports, Subcategory: college basketball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_CBB_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/cbb\n\n5. Query Type Specific Information:\n\n   Cryptocurrency Data Sources:\n   - Binance:\n     * primary: https://api.binance.com/api/v3\n     * proxy: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\n     * RECOMMENDED: Use this proxy endpoint first for better reliability\n     * Example: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy?symbol=BTCUSDT&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime=TIMESTAMP&endTime=TIMESTAMP\n\n     * CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Since a proxy endpoint is provided, you MUST implement a fallback mechanism:\n       1. Try the proxy endpoint first (better reliability)\n       2. If proxy fails (timeout, error response, etc.), automatically fall back to the primary endpoint\n       3. Your code MUST handle this gracefully with try/except blocks\n\n     Example fallback code structure:\n     ```python\n     def get_data(symbol, start_time, end_time):\n         try:\n             # First try the proxy endpoint\n             response = requests.get(f\"{proxy_url}?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n         except Exception as e:\n             print(f\"Proxy endpoint failed: {str(e)}, falling back to primary endpoint\")\n             # Fall back to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n             response = requests.get(f\"{primary_url}/klines?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n     ```\n     \n6. NEVER include actual API key values in the code, always load them from environment variables.\n\n7. IMPORTANT FOR ALL DATA SOURCES: If a proxy endpoint is provided alongside a primary endpoint, you MUST implement the fallback mechanism described above. This is critical for reliability:\n   - Always try the proxy endpoint first\n   - If the proxy fails, fall back to the primary endpoint\n   - Use appropriate timeout values (10 seconds recommended)\n   - Include proper error handling with try/except blocks\n\nThe code should be completely self-contained and runnable with no arguments.\n\n\nHere's a complete code example that shows how to solve this type of problem:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Note: Binance public API doesn't require an API key for basic price queries\n# However, if we need rate limits increased or private endpoints, we would use these:\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\nBINANCE_API_SECRET = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\")\n\n# Sensitive data patterns to mask in logs\nSENSITIVE_PATTERNS = [\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_KEY\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    #

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749046647 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-04 14:17:27 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please ensure the solver uses the correct data source as specified in the query (TradingView for BTC.D 'Close' prices) and verify alignment with market sentiment before making a recommendation.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please ensure the solver uses TradingView as the data source as specified in the query and correctly implements the logic to fetch and compare the 'Close' prices for the specified timestamps.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Configure logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nconsole_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\nconsole_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nconsole_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\nlogger.addHandler(console_handler)\n\n# API endpoints\nPROXY_URL = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\"\nPRIMARY_URL = \"https://api.binance.com/api/v3\"\n\ndef fetch_price(symbol, start_time, end_time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches the close price of a cryptocurrency from Binance using a proxy and primary endpoint.\n    \"\"\"\n    params = {\n        \"symbol\": symbol,\n        \"interval\": \"1m\",\n        \"limit\": 1,\n        \"startTime\": start_time,\n        \"endTime\": end_time\n    }\n    \n    try:\n        # Try proxy endpoint first\n        response = requests.get(PROXY_URL, params=params, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n        if data:\n            return float(data[0][4])\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.warning(f\"Proxy endpoint failed: {e}, falling back to primary endpoint\")\n        # Fall back to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n        try:\n            response = requests.get(f\"{PRIMARY_URL}/klines\", params=params, timeout=10)\n            response.raise_for_status()\n            data = response.json()\n            if data:\n                return float(data[0][4])\n        except Exception as e:\n            logger.error(f\"Primary endpoint also failed: {e}\")\n            raise\n\ndef convert_to_utc_timestamp(date_str, timezone_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts a date string with timezone to a UTC timestamp in milliseconds.\n    \"\"\"\n    tz = pytz.timezone(timezone_str)\n    naive_datetime = datetime.strptime(date_str, \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\")\n    local_datetime = tz.localize(naive_datetime)\n    utc_datetime = local_datetime.astimezone(pytz.utc)\n    return int(utc_datetime.timestamp() * 1000)\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to determine if Bitcoin dominance went up or down in May 2025.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Define the symbol and timezone\n        symbol = \"BTC.D\"\n        timezone_str = \"US/Eastern\"\n        \n        # Convert dates to UTC timestamps\n        start_time = convert_to_utc_timestamp(\"2025-05-01 00:00\", timezone_str)\n        end_time = convert_to_utc_timestamp(\"2025-05-31 23:59\", timezone_str)\n        \n        # Fetch prices\n        start_price = fetch_price(symbol, start_time, start_time + 60000)  # 1 minute range\n        end_price = fetch_price(symbol, end_time, end_time + 60000)\n        \n        # Determine the resolution\n        if start_price < end_price:\n            recommendation = \"p2\"  # Up\n        elif start_price > end_price:\n            recommendation = \"p1\"  # Down\n        else:\n            recommendation = \"p3\"  # 50-50\n        \n        print(f\"recommendation: {recommendation}\")\n        \n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        print(\"recommendation: p4\")  # Unable to resolve\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p4\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Try the proxy endpoint first (better reliability)\n       2. If proxy fails (timeout, error response, etc.), automatically fall back to the primary endpoint\n       3. Your code MUST handle this gracefully with try/except blocks\n\n     Example fallback code structure:\n     ```python\n     def get_data(symbol, start_time, end_time):\n         try:\n             # First try the proxy endpoint\n             response = requests.get(f\"{proxy_url}?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n         except Exception as e:\n             print(f\"Proxy endpoint failed: {str(e)}, falling back to primary endpoint\")\n             # Fall back to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n             response = requests.get(f\"{primary_url}/klines?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n     ```\n     \n6. NEVER include actual API key values in the code, always load them from environment variables.\n\n7. IMPORTANT FOR ALL DATA SOURCES: If a proxy endpoint is provided alongside a primary endpoint, you MUST implement the fallback mechanism described above. This is critical for reliability:\n   - Always try the proxy endpoint first\n   - If the proxy fails, fall back to the primary endpoint\n   - Use appropriate timeout values (10 seconds recommended)\n   - Include proper error handling with try/except blocks\n\nThe code should be completely self-contained and runnable with no arguments.\n\n\nHere's a complete code example that shows how to solve this type of problem:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Note: Binance public API doesn't require an API key for basic price queries\n# However, if we need rate limits increased or private endpoints, we would use these:\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\nBINANCE_API_SECRET = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\")\n\n# Sensitive data patterns to mask in logs\nSENSITIVE_PATTERNS = [\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_KEY\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    #

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.

Recommendation found: p4.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p4\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0, ID: 112325230309253779991554951608909492693689705537149970118166067432167055749220, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 1, ID: 23349657146262485037845431405429458404333424518340027566996285466937081533622, Winner: Yes\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on whether Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) went up or down in May 2025 according to TradingView data. The key here is to compare the closing percentages of the BTC.D 1-minute candles on May 1st and May 31st in ET timezone.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the exact start and end times. May 1st 00:00 ET and May 31st 23:59 ET. Since the current date is June 4, 2025, the event has already occurred, so I don't need to wait. The resolution source is TradingView's BTC.D chart, specifically the 1-minute candles.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's information on how to export chart data from TradingView (source 1, 16). That's useful because the user might need to retrieve historical data. Also, the BTC.D symbol is mentioned in source 15, which confirms it's tracked on TradingView. \n\nThe ancillary data defines p1 as Down (May 1 close higher than May 31), p2 as Up (May 1 lower than May 31), and p3 if they're equal. The task is to check these two data points.\n\nNow, the challenge is accessing the specific 1-minute candles for those dates. The user provided a link to the TradingView chart, but I can't browse the web. However, the search results mention that TradingView allows exporting data to CSV (sources 1, 16). If the user has access to this data, they can export it and compare the closes. \n\nAnother point is the timezone conversion. ET could be Eastern Time, which is either EDT or EST. In May 2025, EDT is in effect (UTC-4) as daylight saving ends in November (sources 17, 18, 19). So May dates are in EDT. The exact timestamps need to be converted to UTC for consistency, but TradingView's data should reflect ET times correctly.\n\nSince the user specified TradingView as the resolution source, I must rely on that data. If the exported CSV from TradingView shows the May 1 00:00 EDT close and May 31 23:59 EDT close, comparing those two values will determine the outcome. \n\nHowever, without actual data access, I can't retrieve the exact numbers. The search results don't provide historical BTC.D values for May 2025. Sources 3, 5, 7 mention Bitcoin dominance trends but not the specific dates needed. For example, source 5 states BTC dominance reached 65.09% on May 6, 2025, but that's mid-month. Source 3's Q1 2025 report shows BTC dominance at 59.1% in Q1, but the query is about May.\n\nGiven the lack of specific data in the provided sources, I can't definitively determine the outcome. The user might need to export the data themselves using TradingView's export feature (source 1) or via their API (sources 2, 6). If the data isn't available, the resolution would default to p4, but since the event date has passed, the resolution should be based on the most probable outcome. However, without data, it's impossible to confirm. \n\nWait, the current timestamp is June 4, 2025, so the event is in the past. The user must have access to the data. If they followed the instructions to export from TradingView, they could compare the closes. But since the provided search results don't include the specific data points, I can't make an informed decision. Therefore, the recommendation would be p4 (cannot resolve) due to insufficient data. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nLooking at the trend in the sources: source 5 mentions BTC dominance rising to 65.09% by May 6, and source 3's Q1 report shows BTC dominance increasing. If the trend continued in May, maybe BTC.D increased, leading to a Down resolution (p1). But this is speculative. Without concrete data, it's risky. The correct approach is to check the actual TradingView data. Since I can't do that, and the user expects a resolution, perhaps the answer is p4. But the instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, without any data points, it's unclear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the available data. Source 5 says BTC.D was 65.09% on May 6. If the starting point on May 1 was lower than that, and it continued to rise, then May 31 close would be higher than May 1, resulting in Down (p1). But this is an assumption. Since the query requires exact closes from TradingView, and the sources don't provide those numbers, I can't confirm. Therefore, the safest recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749046647 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-04 14:17:27 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on whether Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) went up or down in May 2025 according to TradingView data. The key here is to compare the closing percentages of the BTC.D 1-minute candles on May 1st and May 31st in ET timezone.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the exact start and end times. May 1st 00:00 ET and May 31st 23:59 ET. Since the current date is June 4, 2025, the event has already occurred, so I don't need to wait. The resolution source is TradingView's BTC.D chart, specifically the 1-minute candles.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's information on how to export chart data from TradingView (source 1, 16). That's useful because the user might need to retrieve historical data. Also, the BTC.D symbol is mentioned in source 15, which confirms it's tracked on TradingView. \n\nThe ancillary data defines p1 as Down (May 1 close higher than May 31), p2 as Up (May 1 lower than May 31), and p3 if they're equal. The task is to check these two data points.\n\nNow, the challenge is accessing the specific 1-minute candles for those dates. The user provided a link to the TradingView chart, but I can't browse the web. However, the search results mention that TradingView allows exporting data to CSV (sources 1, 16). If the user has access to this data, they can export it and compare the closes. \n\nAnother point is the timezone conversion. ET could be Eastern Time, which is either EDT or EST. In May 2025, EDT is in effect (UTC-4) as daylight saving ends in November (sources 17, 18, 19). So May dates are in EDT. The exact timestamps need to be converted to UTC for consistency, but TradingView's data should reflect ET times correctly.\n\nSince the user specified TradingView as the resolution source, I must rely on that data. If the exported CSV from TradingView shows the May 1 00:00 EDT close and May 31 23:59 EDT close, comparing those two values will determine the outcome. \n\nHowever, without actual data access, I can't retrieve the exact numbers. The search results don't provide historical BTC.D values for May 2025. Sources 3, 5, 7 mention Bitcoin dominance trends but not the specific dates needed. For example, source 5 states BTC dominance reached 65.09% on May 6, 2025, but that's mid-month. Source 3's Q1 2025 report shows BTC dominance at 59.1% in Q1, but the query is about May.\n\nGiven the lack of specific data in the provided sources, I can't definitively determine the outcome. The user might need to export the data themselves using TradingView's export feature (source 1) or via their API (sources 2, 6). If the data isn't available, the resolution would default to p4, but since the event date has passed, the resolution should be based on the most probable outcome. However, without data, it's impossible to confirm. \n\nWait, the current timestamp is June 4, 2025, so the event is in the past. The user must have access to the data. If they followed the instructions to export from TradingView, they could compare the closes. But since the provided search results don't include the specific data points, I can't make an informed decision. Therefore, the recommendation would be p4 (cannot resolve) due to insufficient data. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nLooking at the trend in the sources: source 5 mentions BTC dominance rising to 65.09% by May 6, and source 3's Q1 report shows BTC dominance increasing. If the trend continued in May, maybe BTC.D increased, leading to a Down resolution (p1). But this is speculative. Without concrete data, it's risky. The correct approach is to check the actual TradingView data. Since I can't do that, and the user expects a resolution, perhaps the answer is p4. But the instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, without any data points, it's unclear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the available data. Source 5 says BTC.D was 65.09% on May 6. If the starting point on May 1 was lower than that, and it continued to rise, then May 31 close would be higher than May 1, resulting in Down (p1). But this is an assumption. Since the query requires exact closes from TradingView, and the sources don't provide those numbers, I can't confirm. Therefore, the safest recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0, ID: 112325230309253779991554951608909492693689705537149970118166067432167055749220, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 1, ID: 23349657146262485037845431405429458404333424518340027566996285466937081533622, Winner: Yes\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to determine if Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) went up or down in May 2025 based on the closing prices of the first and last 1-minute candles on TradingView. The resolution depends on comparing the close percentage of the May 1st 00:00 ET candle with the May 31st 23:59 ET candle. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The provided timestamp is June 4, 2025. Since May 31 has already passed, the event date is in the past. The next step is to verify the closing prices for those specific times on TradingView's BTC.D chart.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention BTC.D and its historical data. For example, result [3] discusses BTC.D in 2025 and mentions a potential drop to around 54.56%, which could indicate a trend. Result [6] and [26] provide technical analysis, suggesting BTC.D might be in a rising wedge or facing resistance, which could influence its movement. However, these are predictions and not actual data.\n\nResult [4] and [33] show that BTC.D's market data on TradingView might not have active trades, which could mean the data is static or not updated in real-time. The key is to find the exact closing percentages for the specified times. \n\nThe user provided a link to the TradingView chart (result [33]), but the search results don't include the exact closing values for May 1 and May 31. Without access to real-time data or historical snapshots from those dates, I can't confirm the actual numbers. \n\nAdditionally, the ancillary data specifies using TradingView as the resolution source. Since the current date is June 4, the data should be available, but the provided search results don't include the specific close prices needed. There's a possibility that the data isn't present in the given sources, or I might need to infer from available trends. \n\nResult [51] from CoinMarketCap's API documentation explains how to retrieve historical BTC.D data, but without executing an API call, I can't fetch the exact values. The user's personalization instructs to use only provided URLs, so I can't use external APIs. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit data points in the search results for the specific dates and times, and considering the event is in the past, I should check if any sources mention the outcome. However, the search results don't provide conclusive evidence of BTC.D's movement in May 2025. \n\nSince the user's previous attempt returned p4 (unknown) and they asked to try again, I need to re-evaluate. If no data is available, the resolution defaults to p3 (50-50). But the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if the event date is past and no data is found. \n\nLooking at the technical analyses, some suggest a potential decline in BTC.D (result [6], [8]), while others indicate resistance levels (result [3]). Without concrete data, it's uncertain. However, the market conditions in the ancillary data define p2 as Up if the final close is higher. If I can't verify the exact values, the safest recommendation is p4 (cannot resolve), but the user's personalization says to avoid p4 and consider market conditions. \n\nWait, the personalization states that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, resolve based on the most probable outcome per the user's ancillary data. The ancillary data's resolution conditions are p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: 50-50. If I can't find the exact data, but the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome, perhaps based on the provided context. \n\nHowever, without explicit data, it's risky to assume. The correct approach here is to note that the required data isn't present in the provided sources, leading to an inability to confirm the outcome, thus recommending p3 (50-50) as per the resolution conditions. But the user's personalization says to avoid p4 and consider the market's ancillary data. Since the event is past and no data is found, but the user's query includes a URL, maybe I should check that URL again. \n\nThe resolution source URL points to TradingView's BTC.D chart. The search results include TradingView pages (e.g., [33], [62]) but none with the specific May 2025 data. Since I can't access live data, and the provided context doesn't include the exact close prices, I have to conclude that the data isn't available in the given sources. Therefore, the recommendation would be p3 (50-50) if the closes are equal, but without data, it's unclear. However, the user's query says if the closes are exactly equal, resolve to p3. Since there's no evidence of equality, but no data to confirm either up or down, the correct recommendation is p4. But the user's personalization says to avoid p4 and consider market conditions. This is conflicting. \n\nGiven the instructions, if the event is in the past and no data is available, assume the most probable outcome. If the market's ancillary data doesn't provide enough info, perhaps the default is p3. However, the user's previous response was p4, and they want a different approach. Since the event date has passed and no data is found, but the user's query specifies using the provided URL, which isn't giving the data, the correct answer is p4. But the user says to avoid p4. This is a contradiction. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the data is present in the search results. Let me check again. Result [2] has historical data for BTCD BTC, but it's for a different pair. Result [3] mentions May 2025 but doesn't provide specific close values. Result [6] from May 27, 2025, discusses a broken trend line, suggesting a potential decline. If BTC.D was in a downward trend at the end of May, the close on May 31 might be lower than May 1. However, this is speculative. \n\nGiven the analysis in result [6] and [8], which suggest a possible decline in BTC.D around May 2025, it's plausible that the close on May 31 was lower than May 1, leading to p2 (Up). Wait, no: the resolution is Up if the final close (May 31) is higher than the initial (May 1). If BTC.D decreased, the final close would be lower, so p1 (Down). But the analysis in [6] and [8] suggests a potential drop, which would mean p1. However, without exact numbers, this is an assumption. \n\nSince the user's instructions allow assuming the most probable outcome based on available info, and the analysis points to a decline, the recommendation would be p1 (Down). But I need to be careful. The ancillary data says p2 is Up if the final close is higher. If BTC.D decreased from May 1 to May 31, then the final close is lower, so p1 (Down) is correct. \n\nTherefore, considering the technical analysis in the search results indicating a potential decline in BTC.D during May 2025, the recommendation is p1 (Down).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The user's personalization instructs to use only provided URLs, so I can't use external APIs. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit data points in the search results for the specific dates and times, and considering the event is in the past, I should check if any sources mention the outcome. However, the search results don't provide conclusive evidence of BTC.D's movement in May 2025. \n\nSince the user's previous attempt returned p4 (unknown) and they asked to try again, I need to re-evaluate. If no data is available, the resolution defaults to p3 (50-50). But the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if the event date is past and no data is found. \n\nLooking at the technical analyses, some suggest a potential decline in BTC.D (result [6], [8]), while others indicate resistance levels (result [3]). Without concrete data, it's uncertain. However, the market conditions in the ancillary data define p2 as Up if the final close is higher. If I can't verify the exact values, the safest recommendation is p4 (cannot resolve), but the user's personalization says to avoid p4 and consider market conditions. \n\nWait, the personalization states that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, resolve based on the most probable outcome per the user's ancillary data. The ancillary data's resolution conditions are p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: 50-50. If I can't find the exact data, but the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome, perhaps based on the provided context. \n\nHowever, without explicit data, it's risky to assume. The correct approach here is to note that the required data isn't present in the provided sources, leading to an inability to confirm the outcome, thus recommending p3 (50-50) as per the resolution conditions. But the user's personalization says to avoid p4 and consider the market's ancillary data. Since the event is past and no data is found, but the user's query includes a URL, maybe I should check that URL again. \n\nThe resolution source URL points to TradingView's BTC.D chart. The search results include TradingView pages (e.g., [33], [62]) but none with the specific May 2025 data. Since I can't access live data, and the provided context doesn't include the exact close prices, I have to conclude that the data isn't available in the given sources. Therefore, the recommendation would be p3 (50-50) if the closes are equal, but without data, it's unclear. However, the user's query says if the closes are exactly equal, resolve to p3. Since there's no evidence of equality, but no data to confirm either up or down, the correct recommendation is p4. But the user's personalization says to avoid p4 and consider market conditions. This is conflicting. \n\nGiven the instructions, if the event is in the past and no data is available, assume the most probable outcome. If the market's ancillary data doesn't provide enough info, perhaps the default is p3. However, the user's previous response was p4, and they want a different approach. Since the event date has passed and no data is found, but the user's query specifies using the provided URL, which isn't giving the data, the correct answer is p4. But the user says to avoid p4. This is a contradiction. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the data is present in the search results. Let me check again. Result [2] has historical data for BTCD BTC, but it's for a different pair. Result [3] mentions May 2025 but doesn't provide specific close values. Result [6] from May 27, 2025, discusses a broken trend line, suggesting a potential decline. If BTC.D was in a downward trend at the end of May, the close on May 31 might be lower than May 1. However, this is speculative. \n\nGiven the analysis in result [6] and [8], which suggest a possible decline in BTC.D around May 2025, it's plausible that the close on May 31 was lower than May 1, leading to p2 (Up). Wait, no: the resolution is Up if the final close (May 31) is higher than the initial (May 1). If BTC.D decreased, the final close would be lower, so p1 (Down). But the analysis in [6] and [8] suggests a potential drop, which would mean p1. However, without exact numbers, this is an assumption. \n\nSince the user's instructions allow assuming the most probable outcome based on available info, and the analysis points to a decline, the recommendation would be p1 (Down). But I need to be careful. The ancillary data says p2 is Up if the final close is higher. If BTC.D decreased from May 1 to May 31, then the final close is lower, so p1 (Down) is correct. \n\nTherefore, considering the technical analysis in the search results indicating a potential decline in BTC.D during May 2025, the recommendation is p1 (Down).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0, ID: 112325230309253779991554951608909492693689705537149970118166067432167055749220, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 1, ID: 23349657146262485037845431405429458404333424518340027566996285466937081533622, Winner: Yes\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.
