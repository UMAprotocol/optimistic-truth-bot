      "response": "<think>\nWe are given a query about a market resolution: \"US military action against Iran by Thursday?\" with specific resolution conditions and dates (June 18-19, 2025, 11:59 PM ET). The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if the US initiates military action on Iranian soil, airspace, or maritime territory or against Iranian embassies/consulates during that period. Otherwise, it resolves to \"No\" (p1). We have a current timestamp of 2025-06-20 04:05:26 UTC (which is June 20, 2025, at 4:05 AM UTC). Note that the market resolution period ended on June 19, 2025, 11:59 PM ET (which is June 20, 2025, 3:59 AM UTC). Therefore, the event window has just passed (by about 6 minutes at the current timestamp).\n\nWe are provided with 16 search results (indexed 1 to 16) that contain news and reports from June 15 to June 20, 2025. We must determine if there was any US military action against Iran during the specified period (June 18-19, 2025, 11:59 PM ET) that meets the criteria.\n\nSteps:\n1. Identify the relevant time period: June 18, 2025, 00:00 ET to June 19, 2025, 23:59 ET (which is June 18, 4:00 UTC to June 20, 3:59 UTC). Note: ET is UTC-4 in June (EDT). So 00:00 ET on June 18 is 04:00 UTC on June 18, and 23:59 ET on June 19 is 03:59 UTC on June 20.\n\n2. Review the search results for any reported US military action against Iran during that period.\n\nAnalysis of search results:\n\n- [1] (June 20, 2025): Reports that the US is preparing to support a potential strike on Fordow if Iran rejects conditions. Also, the IDF continued strikes on June 19 (but these are Israeli, not US). It mentions that the US has begun moving assets to the Middle East. No report of actual US military action against Iran.\n\n- [2] (June 19, 2025): Video about Trump saying he will decide within two weeks. No report of action taken.\n\n- [3] (June 20, 2025): Article states Trump is contemplating a strike and will decide within two weeks. No action reported.\n\n- [4] (June 19, 2025): PDF from JINSA. It says: \"According to media reports on June 18, President Donald Trump has approved plans to strike Iran but will not order the strike if Iran is willing to abandon its nuclear weapons program.\" and \"U.S. officials are reportedly preparing for a strike to take place as imminently as June 21\". So no strike on June 18 or 19.\n\n- [5] (June 15, 2025): Video about US Navy defending Israel against Iranian missiles. This is defensive and in Israel, not against Iranian territory. Also, the date is outside the window.\n\n- [6] (June 19, 2025): Hegseth (Defense Secretary) says the Pentagon is providing military options. Trump has not decided. No action.\n\n- [7] (June 18, 2025): Reports that the US is moving additional assets to the Middle East. Also, an Iranian official warned of retaliation if the US strikes. No report of US action.\n\n- [8] (June 18, 2025): Article states that despite Trump's rhetoric, the Pentagon had not made any new major force posture changes and the mission remains defensive. No offensive action.\n\n- [9] (June 19, 2025): Reports that the USS Nimitz is moving into position. Pentagon officials stressed defensive posture. No offensive action.\n\n- [10] (June 19, 2025): CBS News reports that the Trump administration has insisted the US military is not taking part directly. Also, Trump said no decision yet.

We are only concerned with events during the resolution period.\n\nFinal recommendation: p1 (No)\n</think>\n### Analysis of US Military Action Against Iran (June 18-19, 2025)  \nBased on the provided search results and resolution criteria, this analysis examines whether the United States initiated military action against Iranian soil, airspace, maritime territory, or diplomatic facilities between June 18 and June 19, 2025 (11:59 PM ET). The resolution conditions define \"military action\" as the use of force by the U.S. military, officially acknowledged or credibly reported, excluding cyber operations, sanctions, or diplomacy.  \n\n#### Key Findings:  \n1. **No Confirmed U.S. Strikes on Iranian Territory**:  \n   - Multiple sources (e.g., [3][6][10][15]) confirm President Trump deliberated military options but withheld a final decision pending diplomatic outcomes. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated on June 19 that Trump would decide \"within the next two weeks,\" explicitly ruling out immediate action during the resolution window[1][15].  \n   - U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth emphasized a \"defensive posture\" in Senate testimony on June 19, clarifying that troop movements (e.g., deploying the USS *Nimitz* and refueling aircraft) were precautionary, not offensive[6][8][9].  \n\n2. **Absence of Official Acknowledgment or Credible Reports**:  \n   - While the *Wall Street Journal* reported Trump approved attack plans on June 18, subsequent denials from the White House and Reuters confirmed no strikes occurred. Trump refuted the claim on Truth Social, stating, \"No Idea what my thoughts are concerning Iran!\"[3][15].  \n   - Iranian officials warned of retaliation if the U.S. intervened[7][9][10], but no incidents involving U.S. forces on Iranian soil, airspace, or embassies were documented in the search results for June 18\u201319.  \n\n3. **Israeli Operations Unrelated to U.S. Criteria**:  \n   - Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities (e.g., Fordow) and missile sites dominated reporting[1][4][10], but these were conducted independently. U.S. involvement was limited to intelligence sharing and defensive support (e.g., intercepting missiles over Israel)[5][14], which falls outside the resolution criteria for offensive action on Iranian territory[10][15].  \n\n#### Conclusion:  \nThe evidentiary threshold for \"Yes\" resolution remains unmet. Diplomatic channels remained active through June 19[12][15], and U.S. military movements were explicitly defensive[6][8][9]. No credible sources or official acknowledgments confirm U.S. offensive operations against Iranian targets within the specified timeframe.  \n\n**Recommendation: p1** (No)",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: US military action against Iran by Thursday?, description: This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if the US initiates a military action on Iranian soil, airspace, or maritime territory or against any Iranian embassies or consulates between June 18, and June 19, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nFor the purposes of this market, a \"military action\" will be considered to be any use of force executed by the US military on Iranian soil, airspace, or maritime territory (e.g. if a weapons depot on Iranian soil is hit by an the US missile, this market will resolve to \"Yes\") that is officially acknowledged by the the US government or a consensus of credible reporting. This includes, but is not limited to, airstrikes, naval attacks, or ground invasions. Cyber attacks, sanctions, or diplomatic actions will not count towards the resolution of this market.\n\nIn the case that the \"Yes\" resolution criteria are met prior to this market's resolution date, this market will resolve immediately. market_id: 553566\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750392326 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-20 04:05:26 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nWe are given a query about a market resolution: \"US military action against Iran by Thursday?\" with specific resolution conditions and dates (June 18-19, 2025, 11:59 PM ET). The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if the US initiates military action on Iranian soil, airspace, or maritime territory or against Iranian embassies/consulates during that period. Otherwise, it resolves to \"No\" (p1). We have a current timestamp of 2025-06-20 04:05:26 UTC (which is June 20, 2025, at 4:05 AM UTC). Note that the market resolution period ended on June 19, 2025, 11:59 PM ET (which is June 20, 2025, 3:59 AM UTC). Therefore, the event window has just passed (by about 6 minutes at the current timestamp).\n\nWe are provided with 16 search results (indexed 1 to 16) that contain news and reports from June 15 to June 20, 2025. We must determine if there was any US military action against Iran during the specified period (June 18-19, 2025, 11:59 PM ET) that meets the criteria.\n\nSteps:\n1. Identify the relevant time period: June 18, 2025, 00:00 ET to June 19, 2025, 23:59 ET (which is June 18, 4:00 UTC to June 20, 3:59 UTC). Note: ET is UTC-4 in June (EDT). So 00:00 ET on June 18 is 04:00 UTC on June 18, and 23:59 ET on June 19 is 03:59 UTC on June 20.\n\n2. Review the search results for any reported US military action against Iran during that period.\n\nAnalysis of search results:\n\n- [1] (June 20, 2025): Reports that the US is preparing to support a potential strike on Fordow if Iran rejects conditions. Also, the IDF continued strikes on June 19 (but these are Israeli, not US). It mentions that the US has begun moving assets to the Middle East. No report of actual US military action against Iran.\n\n- [2] (June 19, 2025): Video about Trump saying he will decide within two weeks. No report of action taken.\n\n- [3] (June 20, 2025): Article states Trump is contemplating a strike and will decide within two weeks. No action reported.\n\n- [4] (June 19, 2025): PDF from JINSA. It says: \"According to media reports on June 18, President Donald Trump has approved plans to strike Iran but will not order the strike if Iran is willing to abandon its nuclear weapons program.\" and \"U.S. officials are reportedly preparing for a strike to take place as imminently as June 21\". So no strike on June 18 or 19.\n\n- [5] (June 15, 2025): Video about US Navy defending Israel against Iranian missiles. This is defensive and in Israel, not against Iranian territory. Also, the date is outside the window.\n\n- [6] (June 19, 2025): Hegseth (Defense Secretary) says the Pentagon is providing military options. Trump has not decided. No action.\n\n- [7] (June 18, 2025): Reports that the US is moving additional assets to the Middle East. Also, an Iranian official warned of retaliation if the US strikes. No report of US action.\n\n- [8] (June 18, 2025): Article states that despite Trump's rhetoric, the Pentagon had not made any new major force posture changes and the mission remains defensive. No offensive action.\n\n- [9] (June 19, 2025): Reports that the USS Nimitz is moving into position. Pentagon officials stressed defensive posture. No offensive action.\n\n- [10] (June 19, 2025): CBS News reports that the Trump administration has insisted the US military is not taking part directly. Also, Trump said no decision yet. No action.\n\n- [11] (June 17, 2025): Reports the USS Nimitz is sailing to the Middle East. This is movement, not action against Iran.\n\n- [12] (June 17, 2025): Video about the US embassy in Israel being closed due to Iranian strikes. No US action against Iran.\n\n- [13] (2004): Irrelevant (about radio monitoring).\n\n- [14] (June 16, 2025): Reports the Navy is sending the USS Thomas Hudner to bolster air defense.

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (0.999 = 99.9% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.
