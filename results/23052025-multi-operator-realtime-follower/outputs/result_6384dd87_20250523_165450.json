      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Joe Biden will be seen in public between May 19, 2025, 3:30 PM ET and May 31, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The resolution depends on authentic photos or videos from that timeframe. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The system says it's May 23, 2025, so the period in question started a few days ago and ends in about a week. The user provided several search results, some of which mention Biden's recent cancer diagnosis. Let's go through each source.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's a lot about Biden's health. For example, result [10] from May 18 mentions his prostate cancer diagnosis. Then, result [12] from May 20 says Biden thanked supporters on social media with a photo. Wait, the photo was posted on May 19, which is within the timeframe. But the photo is from his home, so is that considered a public appearance? The user's query says \"public,\" so maybe being at home doesn't count unless it's a public event. \n\nResult [13] and [14] also mention the May 19 social media post. The photo shows Biden and Jill at home with their cat. Since it's a personal residence, that might not be a public appearance. However, the query includes digital appearances like live broadcasts. The photo was posted on social media, which is a digital appearance. But the user specified that digital appearances count, so this might qualify. \n\nWait, the user's resolution conditions state that digital appearances including live broadcasts count. The photo was a still image posted on X and Instagram. Does that count as a digital appearance? The query says \"photographed or videotaped between the dates\" and released within the timeframe. The photo was taken on May 19 and released the same day, which is within the window. So even if it's at home, as long as it's a genuine photo released during the period, it should count. \n\nBut I need to verify if the photo is considered a public appearance. The user's market resolves to \"Yes\" if Biden is photographed or videotaped in public. However, the query's description says \"seen in public,\" which might imply being in a public place. The photo is at his home, which is private. But the resolution conditions mention that digital appearances count. This is a bit conflicting. \n\nWait, the description says: \"Digital appearances including live broadcasts will count for this market.\" So even if he's at home, a live broadcast or a digital appearance (like a pre-recorded video) would count. The photo posted on social media is a still image, not a live broadcast. Does a still image count as a digital appearance? The user's description isn't entirely clear. However, the key is whether the image was taken and released within the timeframe. The photo was posted on May 19, which is within the period starting May 19, 3:30 PM ET. The exact time of the post matters. The article in result [13] says he posted it on Monday, May 19. If the post was after 3:30 PM ET, then it's within the window. \n\nAssuming the post was on May 19, after 3:30 PM ET, then the photo would qualify. But if it was before, it wouldn't. The articles don't specify the exact time, but the diagnosis was announced on May 18, and the thank you post was the next day, which is May 19. The user's market starts at 3:30 PM ET on May 19. If the post was made after that time, it counts. If before, it doesn't. Since the articles don't specify the exact time, this introduces uncertainty. \n\nAdditionally, result [15] mentions Biden's social media post on May 19, but again, no time. Without knowing the exact time, it's hard to confirm. However, the burden is on the user to provide evidence. If the photo was posted after 3:30 PM ET on May 19, then \"Yes.\" Otherwise, \"No.\" Since the information is unclear, but the market requires a consensus of credible reporting, we might need to check if credible sources confirm the timing. \n\nAnother angle: the user's query allows for resolution based on a consensus of credible reporting. If multiple sources report that Biden was seen (via the photo) during the timeframe, even if it's a digital appearance, then it would resolve to \"Yes.\" The articles in [12], [13], [14], and [15] all mention the May 19 post. If those sources are considered credible, and the photo is authenticated, then the market resolves to \"Yes.\" \n\nHowever, the photo's authenticity is key. The query requires the image to be authentic, not AI-generated or edited. The sources (like Newsweek, Hello Magazine, etc.) are reputable, so their reporting on the photo's authenticity supports it being real. \n\nTherefore, considering the photo was posted within the timeframe (assuming after 3:30 PM ET on May 19) and is authentic, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2). If the timing is uncertain, but the consensus is that it's within the window, then \"Yes.\" If the timing is before 3:30 PM ET, then \"No.\" But without explicit time stamps, the consensus from credible sources that the photo was released on May 19 (the same day the market started) might lean towards \"Yes.\" \n\nBut wait, the market's start time is May 19, 3:30 PM ET. If the photo was posted earlier that day, it wouldn't count. However, the diagnosis was announced on May 18, and the thank you post was the next day, which is May 19. It's possible the post was made in the morning, before 3:30 PM ET. For example, result [10] says the diagnosis was announced on May 18, and the thank you post was on May 19. If the post was in the morning, it's outside the window. \n\nThis ambiguity means there's uncertainty. If the exact time isn't confirmed, the resolution might be p3 (unknown). However, the user's resolution conditions say p3 is for 50-50 cases. If the evidence is inconclusive, but the photo was on May 19, and the market started at 3:30 PM ET, without knowing the exact time, it's possible the market resolves to p3. However, the burden is on the user to prove the time. \n\nAlternatively, if the photo was taken and released after 3:30 PM ET on May 19, then \"Yes.\" If not, \"No.\" Since the articles don't specify, but the photo was part of the response to the diagnosis announced on May 18, it's likely the post was made on May 19, possibly after the market's start time. Given that the market requires a consensus, and multiple sources report the post on May 19, it's reasonable to assume it's within the timeframe. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p2 (Yes).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1748019109 Current Date and Time: 2025-05-23 16:51:49 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Joe Biden will be seen in public between May 19, 2025, 3:30 PM ET and May 31, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The resolution depends on authentic photos or videos from that timeframe. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The system says it's May 23, 2025, so the period in question started a few days ago and ends in about a week. The user provided several search results, some of which mention Biden's recent cancer diagnosis. Let's go through each source.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's a lot about Biden's health. For example, result [10] from May 18 mentions his prostate cancer diagnosis. Then, result [12] from May 20 says Biden thanked supporters on social media with a photo. Wait, the photo was posted on May 19, which is within the timeframe. But the photo is from his home, so is that considered a public appearance? The user's query says \"public,\" so maybe being at home doesn't count unless it's a public event. \n\nResult [13] and [14] also mention the May 19 social media post. The photo shows Biden and Jill at home with their cat. Since it's a personal residence, that might not be a public appearance. However, the query includes digital appearances like live broadcasts. The photo was posted on social media, which is a digital appearance. But the user specified that digital appearances count, so this might qualify. \n\nWait, the user's resolution conditions state that digital appearances including live broadcasts count. The photo was a still image posted on X and Instagram. Does that count as a digital appearance? The query says \"photographed or videotaped between the dates\" and released within the timeframe. The photo was taken on May 19 and released the same day, which is within the window. So even if it's at home, as long as it's a genuine photo released during the period, it should count. \n\nBut I need to verify if the photo is considered a public appearance. The user's market resolves to \"Yes\" if Biden is photographed or videotaped in public. However, the query's description says \"seen in public,\" which might imply being in a public place. The photo is at his home, which is private. But the resolution conditions mention that digital appearances count. This is a bit conflicting. \n\nWait, the description says: \"Digital appearances including live broadcasts will count for this market.\" So even if he's at home, a live broadcast or a digital appearance (like a pre-recorded video) would count. The photo posted on social media is a still image, not a live broadcast. Does a still image count as a digital appearance? The user's description isn't entirely clear. However, the key is whether the image was taken and released within the timeframe. The photo was posted on May 19, which is within the period starting May 19, 3:30 PM ET. The exact time of the post matters. The article in result [13] says he posted it on Monday, May 19. If the post was after 3:30 PM ET, then it's within the window. \n\nAssuming the post was on May 19, after 3:30 PM ET, then the photo would qualify. But if it was before, it wouldn't. The articles don't specify the exact time, but the diagnosis was announced on May 18, and the thank you post was the next day, which is May 19. The user's market starts at 3:30 PM ET on May 19. If the post was made after that time, it counts. If before, it doesn't. Since the articles don't specify the exact time, this introduces uncertainty. \n\nAdditionally, result [15] mentions Biden's social media post on May 19, but again, no time. Without knowing the exact time, it's hard to confirm. However, the burden is on the user to provide evidence. If the photo was posted after 3:30 PM ET on May 19, then \"Yes.\" Otherwise, \"No.\" Since the information is unclear, but the market requires a consensus of credible reporting, we might need to check if credible sources confirm the timing. \n\nAnother angle: the user's query allows for resolution based on a consensus of credible reporting. If multiple sources report that Biden was seen (via the photo) during the timeframe, even if it's a digital appearance, then it would resolve to \"Yes.\" The articles in [12], [13], [14], and [15] all mention the May 19 post. If those sources are considered credible, and the photo is authenticated, then the market resolves to \"Yes.\" \n\nHowever, the photo's authenticity is key. The query requires the image to be authentic, not AI-generated or edited. The sources (like Newsweek, Hello Magazine, etc.) are reputable, so their reporting on the photo's authenticity supports it being real. \n\nTherefore, considering the photo was posted within the timeframe (assuming after 3:30 PM ET on May 19) and is authentic, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2). If the timing is uncertain, but the consensus is that it's within the window, then \"Yes.\" If the timing is before 3:30 PM ET, then \"No.\" But without explicit time stamps, the consensus from credible sources that the photo was released on May 19 (the same day the market started) might lean towards \"Yes.\" \n\nBut wait, the market's start time is May 19, 3:30 PM ET. If the photo was posted earlier that day, it wouldn't count. However, the diagnosis was announced on May 18, and the thank you post was the next day, which is May 19. It's possible the post was made in the morning, before 3:30 PM ET. For example, result [10] says the diagnosis was announced on May 18, and the thank you post was on May 19. If the post was in the morning, it's outside the window. \n\nThis ambiguity means there's uncertainty. If the exact time isn't confirmed, the resolution might be p3 (unknown). However, the user's resolution conditions say p3 is for 50-50 cases. If the evidence is inconclusive, but the photo was on May 19, and the market started at 3:30 PM ET, without knowing the exact time, it's possible the market resolves to p3. However, the burden is on the user to prove the time. \n\nAlternatively, if the photo was taken and released after 3:30 PM ET on May 19, then \"Yes.\" If not, \"No.\" Since the articles don't specify, but the photo was part of the response to the diagnosis announced on May 18, it's likely the post was made on May 19, possibly after the market's start time. Given that the market requires a consensus, and multiple sources report the post on May 19, it's reasonable to assume it's within the timeframe. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p2 (Yes).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.992, ID: 36157660335260003203247498313865392652434024471945078886510028191310155811939, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.008, ID: 87389651261064664099084061925808941737045712705998868251661921558803708341894, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.992 = 99.2% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
