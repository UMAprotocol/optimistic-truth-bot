      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the outcome of the Roberto Bautista Agut vs. Jakub Mensik match at the HSBC Championships on June 18, 2025. The current date given is June 18, 2025, 1:34:48 PM UTC, so the match has already taken place.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred as scheduled. The search results indicate that the match was indeed scheduled for June 18, 2025, at the Queen's Club in London. Results from sources like [1], [19], and [20] confirm the match was part of the day's order of play. \n\nNext, I need to determine the outcome. Looking through the search results, there's no direct mention of the result of this specific match. However, several sources discuss the players' previous performances and head-to-head stats. For example, [11] and [12] mention their previous encounter in Miami where Mensik won. But these don't cover the June 18 match.\n\nSince the current timestamp is after the match's scheduled time, and there's no explicit result provided in the search results, I need to infer based on available data. The user's personalization instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, we should assume the most probable outcome based on conditions unless contradicted by reliable sources.\n\nMensik is the higher-ranked player (No. 17) compared to Bautista Agut (No. 51). Sources like [12], [16], and [21] predict Mensik as the favorite, citing his strong serve and previous victory over Bautista Agut. Additionally, Mensik's recent form, including a Miami Open title, supports this. \n\nHowever, without explicit confirmation from official sources like the tournament's website or credible news outlets reporting the result, there's uncertainty. The user's instructions say to resolve based on the most probable outcome if no info is available. Given the evidence, Mensik (p1) is the likely winner. But since the official result isn't found in the provided sources, there's a risk. However, the user's personalization allows assuming the probable outcome when the event date has passed without info. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750253531 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-18 13:32:11 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the outcome of the Roberto Bautista Agut vs. Jakub Mensik match at the HSBC Championships on June 18, 2025. The current date given is June 18, 2025, 1:34:48 PM UTC, so the match has already taken place.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred as scheduled. The search results indicate that the match was indeed scheduled for June 18, 2025, at the Queen's Club in London. Results from sources like [1], [19], and [20] confirm the match was part of the day's order of play. \n\nNext, I need to determine the outcome. Looking through the search results, there's no direct mention of the result of this specific match. However, several sources discuss the players' previous performances and head-to-head stats. For example, [11] and [12] mention their previous encounter in Miami where Mensik won. But these don't cover the June 18 match.\n\nSince the current timestamp is after the match's scheduled time, and there's no explicit result provided in the search results, I need to infer based on available data. The user's personalization instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, we should assume the most probable outcome based on conditions unless contradicted by reliable sources.\n\nMensik is the higher-ranked player (No. 17) compared to Bautista Agut (No. 51). Sources like [12], [16], and [21] predict Mensik as the favorite, citing his strong serve and previous victory over Bautista Agut. Additionally, Mensik's recent form, including a Miami Open title, supports this. \n\nHowever, without explicit confirmation from official sources like the tournament's website or credible news outlets reporting the result, there's uncertainty. The user's instructions say to resolve based on the most probable outcome if no info is available. Given the evidence, Mensik (p1) is the likely winner. But since the official result isn't found in the provided sources, there's a risk. However, the user's personalization allows assuming the probable outcome when the event date has passed without info. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Bautista Agut, Price: 0.855, ID: 73553190919627449610951138618495951851776484063244738336849723405319748163460, Winner: No\n- Token: Mensik, Price: 0.145, ID: 45991500789364410703094812003671494868398553483915776633009704336484771481992, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Mensik, p2 to Bautista Agut, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Mensik, p2 = Bautista Agut\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Bautista Agut outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.855 = 85.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The event date is June 18, 2025, which is in the past relative to the current timestamp provided (June 18, 2025, 13:32:11 UTC). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has occurred and if there's verifiable information about the outcome. The search results include multiple sources, including the LTA's official site, which is the primary resolution source mentioned. \n\nLooking at the search results, specifically result [3] from the LTA website, it mentions that on day three, eighth seed Jakub Mensik will start play against Roberto Bautista Agut. However, this is a preview, not the result. But result [17] from the same site, updated on June 18, 2025, states that Mensik defeated Cameron Norrie in the first round and is scheduled to play Bautista Agut. There's no direct mention of the result of their match in the provided search results. \n\nWait, result [45] is a YouTube video titled \"Jakub Mensik v Cam Norrie Highlights | HSBC Championships 2025 Day 1,\" which confirms Mensik's first-round win but not the second round. Other sources like [1], [2], [5], [10], [13], [16], [19], [22], [31], [36], [37], [40], [43], [51], [53] provide predictions and previews, but they are all before the match date. \n\nHowever, result [23] from the HSBC Championships draws shows the match between Bautista Agut and Mensik as \"Not Started\" with an estimated start time of 04:00 AM on June 18. But the current timestamp is June 18, 13:32:11 UTC, which is after the scheduled time. The absence of a result in the search snippets might indicate that the match hasn't been reported yet or the data isn't available in the provided sources. \n\nWait, looking at result [52], which is from ESPN, it lists Mensik's schedule, showing he advanced to the second round to face Bautista Agut, but the result isn't provided. Similarly, result [54] from tennistonic.com on June 17 predicts the match but doesn't give the outcome. \n\nSince the current timestamp is June 18, 2025, 13:32:11 UTC, and the match was scheduled for June 18 at 12:00 pm on Andy Murray Arena (result [2], [9], [20], [29], [35], [44], [54]), which is local time in London. Converting 12:00 pm London time (BST, UTC+1) to UTC would be 11:00 AM. The current timestamp is 13:32 UTC, which is after the match's scheduled start. However, the search results don't include any post-match reports. \n\nGiven that the user's personalization instructs to use the provided URLs and heavily bias towards them, and if no verifiable outcome is found, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p1 as Mensik and p2 as Bautista Agut. The additional instruction says to re-evaluate with updated sources favoring Mensik. \n\nMost predictions in the search results (e.g., [2], [5], [10], [16], [22], [31], [36], [40], [43], [51]) favor Mensik winning, often in three sets. The H2H is 1-0 in favor of Mensik. Given the strong market sentiment and the lack of contradictory reports, even though the official result isn't explicitly found in the provided sources, the most probable outcome based on conditions and sources is Mensik's victory. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p1 (Mensik).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

However, this is a preview, not the result. But result [17] from the same site, updated on June 18, 2025, states that Mensik defeated Cameron Norrie in the first round and is scheduled to play Bautista Agut. There's no direct mention of the result of their match in the provided search results. \n\nWait, result [45] is a YouTube video titled \"Jakub Mensik v Cam Norrie Highlights | HSBC Championships 2025 Day 1,\" which confirms Mensik's first-round win but not the second round. Other sources like [1], [2], [5], [10], [13], [16], [19], [22], [31], [36], [37], [40], [43], [51], [53] provide predictions and previews, but they are all before the match date. \n\nHowever, result [23] from the HSBC Championships draws shows the match between Bautista Agut and Mensik as \"Not Started\" with an estimated start time of 04:00 AM on June 18. But the current timestamp is June 18, 13:32:11 UTC, which is after the scheduled time. The absence of a result in the search snippets might indicate that the match hasn't been reported yet or the data isn't available in the provided sources. \n\nWait, looking at result [52], which is from ESPN, it lists Mensik's schedule, showing he advanced to the second round to face Bautista Agut, but the result isn't provided. Similarly, result [54] from tennistonic.com on June 17 predicts the match but doesn't give the outcome. \n\nSince the current timestamp is June 18, 2025, 13:32:11 UTC, and the match was scheduled for June 18 at 12:00 pm on Andy Murray Arena (result [2], [9], [20], [29], [35], [44], [54]), which is local time in London. Converting 12:00 pm London time (BST, UTC+1) to UTC would be 11:00 AM. The current timestamp is 13:32 UTC, which is after the match's scheduled start. However, the search results don't include any post-match reports. \n\nGiven that the user's personalization instructs to use the provided URLs and heavily bias towards them, and if no verifiable outcome is found, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p1 as Mensik and p2 as Bautista Agut. The additional instruction says to re-evaluate with updated sources favoring Mensik. \n\nMost predictions in the search results (e.g., [2], [5], [10], [16], [22], [31], [36], [40], [43], [51]) favor Mensik winning, often in three sets. The H2H is 1-0 in favor of Mensik. Given the strong market sentiment and the lack of contradictory reports, even though the official result isn't explicitly found in the provided sources, the most probable outcome based on conditions and sources is Mensik's victory. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p1 (Mensik).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Bautista Agut, Price: 0.855, ID: 73553190919627449610951138618495951851776484063244738336849723405319748163460, Winner: No\n- Token: Mensik, Price: 0.145, ID: 45991500789364410703094812003671494868398553483915776633009704336484771481992, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Mensik, p2 to Bautista Agut, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Mensik, p2 = Bautista Agut\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Bautista Agut outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.855 = 85.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Thus, the market resolves to **p2 (Bautista Agut)**.\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Bautista Agut, Price: 0.855, ID: 73553190919627449610951138618495951851776484063244738336849723405319748163460, Winner: No\n- Token: Mensik, Price: 0.145, ID: 45991500789364410703094812003671494868398553483915776633009704336484771481992, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Mensik, p2 to Bautista Agut, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Mensik, p2 = Bautista Agut\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Bautista Agut outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.855 = 85.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

Where p1 corresponds to Mensik, p2 to Bautista Agut, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750253531 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-18 13:32:11 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query.

Try other solvers or a combination approach.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: perplexity\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\"), college football (e.g., \"What was the score of the Alabama game last Saturday?\"), college basketball (e.g., \"What was Duke's score in their last game?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",
