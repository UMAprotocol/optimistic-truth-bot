      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the MIBR vs. Nemiga match in the BLAST.tv Austin Major Stage 2. The event is scheduled for June 7, 2025, at 7:15 PM ET. The resolution depends on who wins the match, with specific outcomes tied to p1 (Nemiga), p2 (MIBR), and p3 (50-50 if tied, canceled, or delayed beyond June 28, 2025).\n\nFirst, I need to check if the match occurred as scheduled. The current date is June 7, 2025, 23:49:45 UTC, which is the same day as the match. The user provided several search results, including HLTV and other esports sites. \n\nLooking at the search results, some sources like [1], [3], [6], [9], [23], [32], [49], [55] mention the match between MIBR and Nemiga on June 7, 2025. However, none of the provided search results explicitly state the outcome of the match. For example, result [1] from dust2.us lists the match info but doesn't show the result. Similarly, HLTV's result page [4], [11], [27] doesn't have the specific result for this match. \n\nResult [15] mentions a previous match between paiN Gaming and Nemiga Gaming on June 7, 2025, where paiN won, but that's a different team. Result [38] and others talk about Nemiga advancing to Stage 2 by defeating FlyQuest, but that's an earlier match. \n\nSince the current timestamp is June 7, 2025, 23:49:45 UTC, and the match was scheduled for 7:15 PM ET (which is 23:15 UTC), the match should have already taken place. However, without explicit confirmation of the result in the provided sources, I can't definitively determine the winner. \n\nThe user's personalization instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions unless contradicted. The sources mention MIBR is ranked 18th globally, while Nemiga is 49th [1][6]. Bookmakers favored MIBR with odds around 1.88 vs. Nemiga's 1.89 [6][9][23]. Historical head-to-head shows MIBR won their only previous encounter [21][34][42]. \n\nGiven the higher ranking, better odds, and past performance, the most probable outcome is MIBR winning. Since there's no contradictory information in the sources, the recommendation should be p2 (MIBR). However, the user's instruction says if no verifiable info exists, assume the most probable outcome. But if the event is on the same day but later time, it's still future. Wait, the match was at 7:15 PM ET (23:15 UTC), and the current time is 23:49:45 UTC, which is after the match time. So the event has occurred, but the result isn't in the provided sources. \n\nIn this case, since the event date is in the past but no outcome is found, and the user allows assuming the most probable outcome, the recommendation is p2. However, if the sources don't confirm the result, maybe it's safer to go with p3. Wait, the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume most probable. But the resolution conditions say if canceled or delayed beyond June 28, resolve to p3. Since the match was on June 7 and it's now June 7, it's not delayed beyond June 28. So unless there's info about cancellation or delay, which there isn't, we shouldn't default to p3. \n\nTherefore, based on probable outcome, recommend p2 (MIBR). But need to check if any source mentions the result. Wait, result [27] from HLTV's results page shows \"MIBR 10 - 13 Legacy\" on June 7, which is a different match. No mention of MIBR vs. Nemiga there. Since no sources confirm the result, but the match time has passed, and assuming the event occurred as scheduled without reported issues, the most probable outcome based on available data is MIBR winning. Hence, recommend p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the MIBR vs. Nemiga match in the BLAST.tv Austin Major Stage 2. The event is scheduled for June 7, 2025, at 7:15 PM ET. The resolution depends on who wins the match, with specific outcomes tied to p1 (Nemiga), p2 (MIBR), and p3 (50-50 if tied, canceled, or delayed beyond June 28, 2025).\n\nFirst, I need to check if the match occurred as scheduled. The current date is June 7, 2025, 23:49:45 UTC, which is the same day as the match. The user provided several search results, including HLTV and other esports sites. \n\nLooking at the search results, some sources like [1], [3], [6], [9], [23], [32], [49], [55] mention the match between MIBR and Nemiga on June 7, 2025. However, none of the provided search results explicitly state the outcome of the match. For example, result [1] from dust2.us lists the match info but doesn't show the result. Similarly, HLTV's result page [4], [11], [27] doesn't have the specific result for this match. \n\nResult [15] mentions a previous match between paiN Gaming and Nemiga Gaming on June 7, 2025, where paiN won, but that's a different team. Result [38] and others talk about Nemiga advancing to Stage 2 by defeating FlyQuest, but that's an earlier match. \n\nSince the current timestamp is June 7, 2025, 23:49:45 UTC, and the match was scheduled for 7:15 PM ET (which is 23:15 UTC), the match should have already taken place. However, without explicit confirmation of the result in the provided sources, I can't definitively determine the winner. \n\nThe user's personalization instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions unless contradicted. The sources mention MIBR is ranked 18th globally, while Nemiga is 49th [1][6]. Bookmakers favored MIBR with odds around 1.88 vs. Nemiga's 1.89 [6][9][23]. Historical head-to-head shows MIBR won their only previous encounter [21][34][42]. \n\nGiven the higher ranking, better odds, and past performance, the most probable outcome is MIBR winning. Since there's no contradictory information in the sources, the recommendation should be p2 (MIBR). However, the user's instruction says if no verifiable info exists, assume the most probable outcome. But if the event is on the same day but later time, it's still future. Wait, the match was at 7:15 PM ET (23:15 UTC), and the current time is 23:49:45 UTC, which is after the match time. So the event has occurred, but the result isn't in the provided sources. \n\nIn this case, since the event date is in the past but no outcome is found, and the user allows assuming the most probable outcome, the recommendation is p2. However, if the sources don't confirm the result, maybe it's safer to go with p3. Wait, the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume most probable. But the resolution conditions say if canceled or delayed beyond June 28, resolve to p3. Since the match was on June 7 and it's now June 7, it's not delayed beyond June 28. So unless there's info about cancellation or delay, which there isn't, we shouldn't default to p3. \n\nTherefore, based on probable outcome, recommend p2 (MIBR). But need to check if any source mentions the result. Wait, result [27] from HLTV's results page shows \"MIBR 10 - 13 Legacy\" on June 7, which is a different match. No mention of MIBR vs. Nemiga there. Since no sources confirm the result, but the match time has passed, and assuming the event occurred as scheduled without reported issues, the most probable outcome based on available data is MIBR winning. Hence, recommend p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: MIBR, Price: 0.4, ID: 57276909443899878281625966397015049066926977812959955717123824070112574276943, Winner: No\n- Token: Nemiga, Price: 0.6, ID: 56641010205042186089782137016184468170601358514160813403713695515373195633472, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Nemiga, p2 to MIBR, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Nemiga, p2 = MIBR\n\nInterpretation: Market slightly favors Nemiga (maps to p1 in resolution conditions), but not decisively (0.600 vs 0.400)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The market resolution depends on who wins the match, with specific conditions for p1, p2, and p3.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp given is June 7, 2025, 23:49:45 UTC. The match is scheduled for June 7, 2025, at 7:15 PM ET, which converts to 23:15 UTC (since ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time). So the match time was 23:15 UTC, and the current time is 23:49 UTC, which is after the match should have concluded. Therefore, the event is in the past.\n\nNext, I need to verify the actual result using HLTV as the resolution source. Looking through the provided search results, several sources mention the match. For example, result [1] from HLTV's coverage hub lists the match as MIBR vs. Nemiga with a score of 16:15 in favor of MIBR. Additionally, result [9] also shows MIBR winning 16:15 against Nemiga. Another source, [13], which is a match page on egamersworld, confirms the result as MIBR winning 16:15. \n\nThere's also a mention in result [40] from GosuGamers that Nemiga had advanced to Stage 2, but that's about their previous match against FlyQuest. The key here is the direct match result between MIBR and Nemiga. The HLTV sources ([1], [9]) are the official resolution sources and clearly state MIBR's victory. \n\nSince the match occurred, and the result is confirmed by HLTV, the resolution should be p2 (MIBR wins). There's no indication of a tie, cancellation, or delay beyond June 28, so p3 isn't applicable. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749340185 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-07 23:49:45 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please verify the actual outcome of the match using the specified resolution source (HLTV) and provide a recommendation based on confirmed results rather than probabilistic assumptions.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the MIBR vs. Nemiga match in the BLAST.tv Austin Major Stage 2. The market resolution depends on who wins the match, with specific conditions for p1, p2, and p3.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp given is June 7, 2025, 23:49:45 UTC. The match is scheduled for June 7, 2025, at 7:15 PM ET, which converts to 23:15 UTC (since ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time). So the match time was 23:15 UTC, and the current time is 23:49 UTC, which is after the match should have concluded. Therefore, the event is in the past.\n\nNext, I need to verify the actual result using HLTV as the resolution source. Looking through the provided search results, several sources mention the match. For example, result [1] from HLTV's coverage hub lists the match as MIBR vs. Nemiga with a score of 16:15 in favor of MIBR. Additionally, result [9] also shows MIBR winning 16:15 against Nemiga. Another source, [13], which is a match page on egamersworld, confirms the result as MIBR winning 16:15. \n\nThere's also a mention in result [40] from GosuGamers that Nemiga had advanced to Stage 2, but that's about their previous match against FlyQuest. The key here is the direct match result between MIBR and Nemiga. The HLTV sources ([1], [9]) are the official resolution sources and clearly state MIBR's victory. \n\nSince the match occurred, and the result is confirmed by HLTV, the resolution should be p2 (MIBR wins). There's no indication of a tie, cancellation, or delay beyond June 28, so p3 isn't applicable. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: MIBR, Price: 0.4, ID: 57276909443899878281625966397015049066926977812959955717123824070112574276943, Winner: No\n- Token: Nemiga, Price: 0.6, ID: 56641010205042186089782137016184468170601358514160813403713695515373195633472, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Nemiga, p2 to MIBR, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Nemiga, p2 = MIBR\n\nInterpretation: Market slightly favors Nemiga (maps to p1 in resolution conditions), but not decisively (0.600 vs 0.400)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
