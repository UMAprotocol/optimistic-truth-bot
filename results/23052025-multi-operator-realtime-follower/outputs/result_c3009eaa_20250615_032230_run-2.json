      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the \"Grounded in the Stars\" statue by Thomas J. Price will be removed from Times Square early, specifically by June 15, 2025, at 11:59 PM ET. The resolution depends on credible reporting confirming the removal by that time.\n\nFirst, I need to check the installation dates. The search results mention the statue was installed on April 29, 2025, and was scheduled to be on view until June 14 or 17, depending on the source. For example, result [1] says until June 14, while [4] mentions June 17. However, the official Times Square Arts page [14] states the end date as June 14. There's a discrepancy here, but the user's query specifies the removal by June 15, which is after the official end date of June 14. Wait, if the official end is June 14, then removal by June 15 would be on time, not early. But the user's query is phrased as \"removed early,\" so maybe there's confusion. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the ancillary data, the market resolves to \"Yes\" if removed by June 15. The original end date is key here. If the statue was supposed to stay until June 14, then removal by June 15 is on schedule, so the answer would be \"No.\" But if the end date was June 17, then removal by June 15 would be early. However, the official source [14] says June 14, so the scheduled removal would be on or after June 14. The user's query is about removal by June 15, which is after the scheduled end date. Therefore, the statue's removal by June 15 would be according to plan, not early. Hence, the answer should be \"No\" (p1). \n\nBut wait, the user's query says \"removed from its installation site... by 11:59 PM ET on June 15, 2025.\" If the original end date was June 14, then removal by June 15 is just one day after, which might still be on time. However, some sources like [15] (Wikipedia) mention June 17 as the end date. This inconsistency needs resolving. The most reliable source is the official Times Square Arts page [14], which states the end date as June 14. Therefore, the statue was scheduled to be removed by June 14. If it's removed by June 15, that's a day later, but the query is about early removal. Early would mean before the scheduled end date. Since the scheduled end is June 14, removal by June 15 is not early but possibly delayed. However, the user's resolution conditions don't account for delays, only early removal. Therefore, if the statue is still there on June 15, it's past its scheduled end date, but the question is whether it was removed early. Since the scheduled removal was June 14, the statue should already be gone by June 15. If it's still there on June 15, that's a delay, but the query is about early removal. Therefore, the answer is \"No\" because the statue was supposed to be removed by June 14, and the query's cutoff is June 15. There's no indication in the search results that the statue was removed before June 14. All sources mention the end date as June 14 or 17, but the official source says June 14. Therefore, the statue was removed on schedule by June 14, so by June 15, it's already gone, making the answer \"No.\" However, the user's current timestamp is June 15, 2025, 3:19:19 UTC, which is before 11:59 PM ET on June 15. If the removal is scheduled for June 14, then by June 15, it should have been removed. But if there's a delay, it might still be there. However, the search results don't mention any early removal. All sources indicate the statue was to be removed in mid-June, with the official end date June 14. Therefore, the answer is \"No,\" the statue wasn't removed early; it was removed on time.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749957559 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-15 03:19:19 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query.

Hence, the answer should be \"No\" (p1). \n\nBut wait, the user's query says \"removed from its installation site... by 11:59 PM ET on June 15, 2025.\" If the original end date was June 14, then removal by June 15 is just one day after, which might still be on time. However, some sources like [15] (Wikipedia) mention June 17 as the end date. This inconsistency needs resolving. The most reliable source is the official Times Square Arts page [14], which states the end date as June 14. Therefore, the statue was scheduled to be removed by June 14. If it's removed by June 15, that's a day later, but the query is about early removal. Early would mean before the scheduled end date. Since the scheduled end is June 14, removal by June 15 is not early but possibly delayed. However, the user's resolution conditions don't account for delays, only early removal. Therefore, if the statue is still there on June 15, it's past its scheduled end date, but the question is whether it was removed early. Since the scheduled removal was June 14, the statue should already be gone by June 15. If it's still there on June 15, that's a delay, but the query is about early removal. Therefore, the answer is \"No\" because the statue was supposed to be removed by June 14, and the query's cutoff is June 15. There's no indication in the search results that the statue was removed before June 14. All sources mention the end date as June 14 or 17, but the official source says June 14. Therefore, the statue was removed on schedule by June 14, so by June 15, it's already gone, making the answer \"No.\" However, the user's current timestamp is June 15, 2025, 3:19:19 UTC, which is before 11:59 PM ET on June 15. If the removal is scheduled for June 14, then by June 15, it should have been removed. But if there's a delay, it might still be there. However, the search results don't mention any early removal. All sources indicate the statue was to be removed in mid-June, with the official end date June 14. Therefore, the answer is \"No,\" the statue wasn't removed early; it was removed on time.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.994, ID: 53203163716141454493990183784663333432154604019994201636795599422524727068187, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.006, ID: 82649350187298258248888284827622645343688582335643907891261983432331947761789, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.994 = 99.4% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Price will be removed from Times Square by June 15, 2025, at 11:59 PM ET. The resolution depends on credible reporting confirming the removal by that time.\n\nFirst, I need to check the installation dates. The search results mention the statue was installed on April 29, 2025, and was scheduled to be on display until June 14 or 17, depending on the source. For example, result [1] says until June 14, while [5] mentions June 17. Wait, there's a discrepancy here. Let me cross-verify. Result [6] from the Times Square official site states the end date as June 14, 2025. However, result [5] from The Art Newspaper says until June 17. Hmm, that's conflicting. But result [12] from Time Out New York also mentions June 17. This inconsistency needs resolution.\n\nLooking deeper, result [6] (official Times Square site) says the sculpture is on view until June 14. But other sources like [5] and [12] say June 17. Maybe there was a date extension? Or a typo? The user's query is about removal by June 15. If the original end date was June 14, then removal would have already started before June 15. But if it's June 17, then the statue would still be up on June 15. The user's current timestamp is June 15, 2025. So, if the official end date is June 14, the statue should be removed by June 15. However, some sources say June 17. This is critical.\n\nWait, result [3] from Governing.com, dated June 12, 2025, states the statue will be removed this Saturday (June 14). That aligns with the official Times Square site. But result [5] (The Art Newspaper) says until June 17. Maybe the Midnight Moment animations end on June 14, but the sculpture stays until the 17th? Let me check. Result [1] mentions the sculpture until June 14 and the Midnight Moment in May. Result [6] also says the sculpture ends June 14. So perhaps the June 17 date in other articles is a mistake. The official source (Times Square Arts) should be the most reliable. Therefore, the planned removal is June 14. If that's the case, the statue would be removed by June 14, before the user's deadline of June 15. But the user's current date is June 15, so if it was removed on June 14, then the answer is \"Yes.\" However, if there's a delay and it's still up on June 15, then \"No.\"\n\nBut according to the user's current timestamp (June 15, 2025), if the statue was scheduled for removal on June 14, it should already be gone. However, result [3] mentions the statue's removal on June 14 (Saturday), which would be the day before the current date (June 15). So unless there's a delay, the statue is already removed. But the user's query is whether it's removed by June 15. If the removal happened on June 14, then yes. But if the removal is scheduled for June 17, then no. The conflicting dates need clarification.\n\nWait, the user's ancillary data says the market resolves to \"Yes\" if removed by June 15. The official end date from the Times Square site (result [6]) is June 14. Therefore, the planned removal is June 14, so it should be removed by June 15. However, if there's any credible reporting indicating a delay or extension, that would affect the outcome. Checking the search results, there's no mention of an extension beyond June 14. Result [3] (Governing.com) from June 12 confirms removal on June 14. Therefore, the statue was removed on June 14, meeting the June 15 deadline. Hence, the resolution should be \"Yes\" (p2). But I need to ensure there's no conflicting information. Result [8] from ABC7NY mentions the statue will be there through June 17, but that's from May 19. The more recent result [3] from June 12 says removal on June 14. The official site (result [6]) also says June 14. Therefore, the correct end date is June 14, so the statue is removed by June 15. The answer is \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Result [3] (Governing.com) from June 12 confirms removal on June 14. Therefore, the statue was removed on June 14, meeting the June 15 deadline. Hence, the resolution should be \"Yes\" (p2). But I need to ensure there's no conflicting information. Result [8] from ABC7NY mentions the statue will be there through June 17, but that's from May 19. The more recent result [3] from June 12 says removal on June 14. The official site (result [6]) also says June 14. Therefore, the correct end date is June 14, so the statue is removed by June 15. The answer is \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.994, ID: 53203163716141454493990183784663333432154604019994201636795599422524727068187, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.006, ID: 82649350187298258248888284827622645343688582335643907891261983432331947761789, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.994 = 99.4% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
