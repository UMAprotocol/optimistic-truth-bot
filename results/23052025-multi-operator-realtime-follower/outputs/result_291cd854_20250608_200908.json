Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\"), college football (e.g., \"What was the score of the Alabama game last Saturday?\"), college basketball (e.g., \"What was Duke's score in their last game?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Astros vs. Guardians, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for June 8 at 1:40PM ET:\nIf the Houston Astros win, the market will resolve to \"Astros\".\nIf the Cleveland Guardians win, the market will resolve to \"Guardians\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\nTo know when a postponed game will be played, please check the home team's schedule on MLB.com for the listed team and look for the game described as a makeup game.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Guardians, p2 to Astros, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.

Recommendation found: p4.\n\nOutput:\nError fetching data from primary endpoint: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json/GamesByDate/2025-06-08\nError fetching data from proxy endpoint.\nrecommendation: p4\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Astros, Price: 0.0445, ID: 67354643498725414298659708114401120526176168238883930554383983386765775847301, Winner: No\n- Token: Guardians, Price: 0.9555, ID: 90144520196921621472086675814180580534843300747898389206029344597212651814036, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Guardians, p2 to Astros, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Guardians, p2 = Astros\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Guardians outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.956 = 95.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Astros vs. Guardians, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for June 8 at 1:40PM ET:\nIf the Houston Astros win, the market will resolve to \"Astros\".\nIf the Cleveland Guardians win, the market will resolve to \"Guardians\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\nTo know when a postponed game will be played, please check the home team's schedule on MLB.com for the listed team and look for the game described as a makeup game.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Guardians, p2 to Astros, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749412994 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-08 20:03:14 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\n# Load environment variables\nload_dotenv()\nAPI_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\nif not API_KEY:\n    raise ValueError(\"Missing SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\n\n# API configuration\nHEADERS = {\"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key\": API_KEY}\nPRIMARY_ENDPOINT = \"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json\"\nPROXY_ENDPOINT = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\"\n\n# Game details\nGAME_DATE = \"2025-06-08\"\nHOME_TEAM = \"Guardians\"\nAWAY_TEAM = \"Astros\"\n\n# Resolution map\nRESOLUTION_MAP = {\n    \"Guardians\": \"p1\",\n    \"Astros\": \"p2\",\n    \"50-50\": \"p3\",\n    \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\"\n}\n\ndef get_data(url, headers):\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        return response.json()\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error fetching data: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef find_game(games, home_team, away_team):\n    for game in games:\n        if game['HomeTeam'] == home_team and game['AwayTeam'] == away_team:\n            return game\n    return None\n\ndef resolve_market(game):\n    if not game:\n        return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"Too early to resolve\"]\n    if game['Status'] == 'Final':\n        if game['HomeTeamRuns'] > game['AwayTeamRuns']:\n            return RESOLUTION_MAP[game['HomeTeam']]\n        elif game['HomeTeamRuns'] < game['AwayTeamRuns']:\n            return RESOLUTION_MAP[game['AwayTeam']]\n    elif game['Status'] in ['Canceled', 'Postponed']:\n        return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"50-50\"]\n    return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"Too early to resolve\"]\n\ndef main():\n    date_formatted = datetime.strptime(GAME_DATE, \"%Y-%m-%d\").strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n    games_url = f\"{PRIMARY_ENDPOINT}/GamesByDate/{date_formatted}\"\n    games_data = get_data(games_url, HEADERS)\n    \n    if not games_data:\n        # Try proxy if primary fails\n        games_data = get_data(PROXY_ENDPOINT, HEADERS)\n        if not games_data:\n            print(\"Failed to retrieve data from both primary and proxy endpoints.\")\n            return\n\n    game = find_game(games_data, HOME_TEAM, AWAY_TEAM)\n    result = resolve_market(game)\n    print(f\"recommendation: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nError fetching data: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json/GamesByDate/2025-06-08\nError fetching data: 400 Client Error: Bad Request for url: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\nFailed to retrieve data from both primary and proxy endpoints.\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful, but no direct recommendation found.

Where p1 corresponds to Guardians, p2 to Astros, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Guardians, p2 = Astros\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Guardians outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.956 = 95.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Where p1 corresponds to Guardians, p2 to Astros, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749412994 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-08 20:03:14 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources.

Where p1 corresponds to Guardians, p2 to Astros, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Guardians, p2 = Astros\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Guardians outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.956 = 95.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Astros vs. Guardians game scheduled for June 8, 2025, at 1:40 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Guardians, p2 for Astros, and p3 if the game is canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The provided timestamp is June 8, 2025, 20:03:14 UTC, which is 8:03 PM UTC. The game was supposed to start at 1:40 PM ET, which is 5:40 PM UTC. Since the current time is past the scheduled start, the game should have already occurred.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are multiple sources indicating the outcome. Results [1], [2], [9], and [12] all mention the Astros winning 5-3 in 10 innings on June 7. Wait, the game in question is June 8, but these results are from June 7. Hmm, maybe there's confusion here. Let me check the dates again.\n\nWait, the user's query mentions the game scheduled for June 8 at 1:40 PM ET. However, the search results [1], [2], [9], [12] all refer to games on June 7 and June 6. For example, result [1] is from June 7, 2025, and [3], [5] are from June 8. Wait, result [3] and [5] are from June 8, showing Bo Naylor's home run, which is part of the June 8 game. But the detailed reports in [12] and [9] mention the June 7 game going into extra innings. \n\nWait, there's a discrepancy here. The user is asking about the June 8 game, but the search results include games from June 6, 7, and 8. Let me check each result carefully. \n\nResult [3] and [5] are from June 8, showing Bo Naylor's home run in the 2nd inning. Result [11] mentions Tanner Bibee's outing on June 8. Result [13] is a live score for the June 8 game, showing the Astros at 36-28 and Guardians at 33-30. However, the detailed box score in [10] and the recap in [12] are about the June 7 game. \n\nWait, the user's query is about the June 8 game, but the search results include games from previous days. The key is to find the result of the June 8 game. Let me look for the most recent information. \n\nResult [13] is a live score for the June 8 game, but it doesn't show the final score. However, result [3] and [5] are from June 8, showing Bo Naylor's home run, which suggests the game was played. Result [11] mentions Tanner Bibee's performance on June 8, indicating the game occurred. \n\nBut where is the final score for June 8? The search results don't explicitly state the outcome of the June 8 game. The latest detailed recap is from June 7. The user's current timestamp is June 8, 8:03 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. \n\nWait, perhaps the June 8 game is still ongoing or the results haven't been updated in the provided search results. However, result [3] and [5] are from June 8 and show Bo Naylor homering in the 2nd inning, but no final score. Result [11] mentions Tanner Bibee's outing on June 8 but doesn't give the game's outcome. \n\nGiven the ancillary data, if the game occurred and the Astros won, it's p2. If Guardians won, p1. If postponed or canceled, p3. Since the current time is past the game's scheduled time, and the search results don't provide a clear final score for June 8, but there are mentions of the game being played (Bo Naylor's HR, Bibee's pitching), it's likely the game was completed. \n\nHowever, without explicit final score data for June 8 in the provided search results, I might have to infer. Wait, the user might have made a mistake in the date. The search results [1], [2], [9], [12] all refer to the June 7 game, which the Astros won. The June 8 game might be a different matchup. But the user's query is specifically about June 8. \n\nGiven the confusion, I need to check if the sources mention the June 8 game's outcome. Result [10] is a box score dated June 8, but it's incomplete. The live score in [13] doesn't show the final result. The lack of explicit final score for June 8 in the provided context might mean the game was postponed or the data isn't available. However, the presence of in-game highlights (Bo Naylor's HR) suggests the game was played. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user provided the wrong date, and the game in question is actually June 7. But the query clearly states June 8. Given the information available, if the game was played on June 8 and the Astros won, then p2. If Guardians won, p1. If no result is found, but the game was played, perhaps the Astros won based on previous games. However, without explicit confirmation, it's risky. \n\nWait, result [13] shows the Astros at 36-28 and Guardians at 33-30 as of June 8. If the Astros won on June 7, their record would be 36-28, and if they played on June 8, the result would update that. But without the final score, it's unclear. \n\nGiven the ancillary data, if the game was not postponed or canceled, and based on the provided sources not showing a clear June 8 result, but the user's current time is after the game, I might have to assume the game was played. However, without the result, I can't confirm the winner. \n\nBut wait, the user's personalization instructions say if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The Astros have been winning previous games, but without explicit data, it's uncertain. However, the presence of in-game highlights from June 8 (Bo Naylor's HR) suggests the game was played, but the final result isn't provided in the search results. \n\nThis is a tough one. The safe answer would be p4 if the outcome isn't verifiable, but according to the personalization rules, if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, the instructions also say if no verifiable info, default to p4. \n\nWait, the personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" \n\nIn this case, the event date is June 8, which is in the past (current time is June 8, 8:03 PM UTC). The user prompt's ancillary data says if the game is canceled, resolve 50-50. But the game was played, as per the highlights. However, without the final result, I can't determine the winner. \n\nBut the user's instructions also say: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nSince the game was played (highlights exist), but the outcome isn't clear from the provided sources, I have to infer. The Astros won the previous two games, but that doesn't guarantee this one. However, result [11] mentions Tanner Bibee's strong outing for the Guardians, which might indicate they won. But without the final score, it's unclear. \n\nGiven the conflict, the safest recommendation is p4, as the outcome isn't verifiable from the provided sources. However, the personalization rules might require assuming the most probable outcome. But without data, it's impossible. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749412994 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-08 20:03:14 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Astros vs. Guardians game scheduled for June 8, 2025, at 1:40 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Guardians, p2 for Astros, and p3 if the game is canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The provided timestamp is June 8, 2025, 20:03:14 UTC, which is 8:03 PM UTC. The game was supposed to start at 1:40 PM ET, which is 5:40 PM UTC. Since the current time is past the scheduled start, the game should have already occurred.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are multiple sources indicating the outcome. Results [1], [2], [9], and [12] all mention the Astros winning 5-3 in 10 innings on June 7. Wait, the game in question is June 8, but these results are from June 7. Hmm, maybe there's confusion here. Let me check the dates again.\n\nWait, the user's query mentions the game scheduled for June 8 at 1:40 PM ET. However, the search results [1], [2], [9], [12] all refer to games on June 7 and June 6. For example, result [1] is from June 7, 2025, and [3], [5] are from June 8. Wait, result [3] and [5] are from June 8, showing Bo Naylor's home run, which is part of the June 8 game. But the detailed reports in [12] and [9] mention the June 7 game going into extra innings. \n\nWait, there's a discrepancy here. The user is asking about the June 8 game, but the search results include games from June 6, 7, and 8. Let me check each result carefully. \n\nResult [3] and [5] are from June 8, showing Bo Naylor's home run in the 2nd inning. Result [11] mentions Tanner Bibee's outing on June 8. Result [13] is a live score for the June 8 game, showing the Astros at 36-28 and Guardians at 33-30. However, the detailed box score in [10] and the recap in [12] are about the June 7 game. \n\nWait, the user's query is about the June 8 game, but the search results include games from previous days. The key is to find the result of the June 8 game. Let me look for the most recent information. \n\nResult [13] is a live score for the June 8 game, but it doesn't show the final score. However, result [3] and [5] are from June 8, showing Bo Naylor's home run, which suggests the game was played. Result [11] mentions Tanner Bibee's performance on June 8, indicating the game occurred. \n\nBut where is the final score for June 8? The search results don't explicitly state the outcome of the June 8 game. The latest detailed recap is from June 7. The user's current timestamp is June 8, 8:03 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. \n\nWait, perhaps the June 8 game is still ongoing or the results haven't been updated in the provided search results. However, result [3] and [5] are from June 8 and show Bo Naylor homering in the 2nd inning, but no final score. Result [11] mentions Tanner Bibee's outing on June 8 but doesn't give the game's outcome. \n\nGiven the ancillary data, if the game occurred and the Astros won, it's p2. If Guardians won, p1. If postponed or canceled, p3. Since the current time is past the game's scheduled time, and the search results don't provide a clear final score for June 8, but there are mentions of the game being played (Bo Naylor's HR, Bibee's pitching), it's likely the game was completed. \n\nHowever, without explicit final score data for June 8 in the provided search results, I might have to infer. Wait, the user might have made a mistake in the date. The search results [1], [2], [9], [12] all refer to the June 7 game, which the Astros won. The June 8 game might be a different matchup. But the user's query is specifically about June 8. \n\nGiven the confusion, I need to check if the sources mention the June 8 game's outcome. Result [10] is a box score dated June 8, but it's incomplete. The live score in [13] doesn't show the final result. The lack of explicit final score for June 8 in the provided context might mean the game was postponed or the data isn't available. However, the presence of in-game highlights (Bo Naylor's HR) suggests the game was played. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user provided the wrong date, and the game in question is actually June 7. But the query clearly states June 8. Given the information available, if the game was played on June 8 and the Astros won, then p2. If Guardians won, p1. If no result is found, but the game was played, perhaps the Astros won based on previous games. However, without explicit confirmation, it's risky. \n\nWait, result [13] shows the Astros at 36-28 and Guardians at 33-30 as of June 8. If the Astros won on June 7, their record would be 36-28, and if they played on June 8, the result would update that. But without the final score, it's unclear. \n\nGiven the ancillary data, if the game was not postponed or canceled, and based on the provided sources not showing a clear June 8 result, but the user's current time is after the game, I might have to assume the game was played. However, without the result, I can't confirm the winner. \n\nBut wait, the user's personalization instructions say if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The Astros have been winning previous games, but without explicit data, it's uncertain. However, the presence of in-game highlights from June 8 (Bo Naylor's HR) suggests the game was played, but the final result isn't provided in the search results. \n\nThis is a tough one. The safe answer would be p4 if the outcome isn't verifiable, but according to the personalization rules, if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, the instructions also say if no verifiable info, default to p4. \n\nWait, the personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" \n\nIn this case, the event date is June 8, which is in the past (current time is June 8, 8:03 PM UTC). The user prompt's ancillary data says if the game is canceled, resolve 50-50. But the game was played, as per the highlights. However, without the final result, I can't determine the winner. \n\nBut the user's instructions also say: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nSince the game was played (highlights exist), but the outcome isn't clear from the provided sources, I have to infer. The Astros won the previous two games, but that doesn't guarantee this one. However, result [11] mentions Tanner Bibee's strong outing for the Guardians, which might indicate they won. But without the final score, it's unclear. \n\nGiven the conflict, the safest recommendation is p4, as the outcome isn't verifiable from the provided sources. However, the personalization rules might require assuming the most probable outcome. But without data, it's impossible. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Astros, Price: 0.0445, ID: 67354643498725414298659708114401120526176168238883930554383983386765775847301, Winner: No\n- Token: Guardians, Price: 0.9555, ID: 90144520196921621472086675814180580534843300747898389206029344597212651814036, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Guardians, p2 to Astros, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Guardians, p2 = Astros\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Guardians outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.956 = 95.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Houston Astros vs. Cleveland Guardians game scheduled for June 8, 2025, at 1:40 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Astros win, it's p2 (Astros), Guardians win is p1, postponed remains open, and canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The provided timestamp is 2025-06-08 20:03:14 UTC, which is 8:03 PM UTC on June 8. The game was scheduled for 1:40 PM ET, which is 5:40 PM UTC. So the game should have already occurred by the current time. \n\nLooking at the search results, there are multiple sources mentioning the game on June 8. For example, result [1] is a live score from June 8, 2025, showing the game in progress with the Guardians leading 2-0 in the bottom of the 2nd inning. However, other results like [12] and [14] describe Bo Naylor hitting a two-run homer in the 2nd inning, which aligns with the live score. \n\nBut wait, there's a mix of dates in the search results. Some results mention June 7 (like [2], [3], [4], [9], [10], [16]), which was the previous day's game where the Astros won in extra innings. The user's query is specifically about the June 8 game. \n\nResult [11] from June 8 mentions the Guardians having a three-game losing streak and lists the probable pitchers as Brandon Walter for the Astros and Tanner Bibee for the Guardians. Result [12] and [14] show Bo Naylor's home run on June 8, indicating the game was played. Result [1] is a live score, but the current timestamp is after the game's scheduled time, so the live score might be from earlier in the day. \n\nHowever, result [15] from ESPN's matchup page on June 8 shows the final stats, but the content seems mixed with another game (Athletics vs. Rangers), which might be a red herring. The key is to find the final result of the June 8 game between Astros and Guardians. \n\nResult [12] and [14] both describe Bo Naylor's two-run homer in the 2nd inning on June 8, but they don't provide the final score. Result [1] shows the live score with Guardians leading 2-0 in the 2nd, but it's a live update, not the final. Result [7] mentions Tanner Bibee's strong outing on June 8, striking out six over 6.1 innings, which suggests he started and pitched well. \n\nLooking deeper, result [10] from MLB.com on June 8 discusses the Astros' 5-3 win in 10 innings on June 7 and mentions the upcoming game on June 8 with Walter vs. Bibee. But there's no direct mention of the June 8 game's outcome. \n\nWait, result [11] from the Lethbridge Herald on June 8 states the Guardians have a three-game losing streak and lists the probable starters for June 8 as Walter and Bibee. It also mentions the Guardians' record as 33-30 and the Astros as 36-28. However, this doesn't confirm the game's result. \n\nThe critical point is that the current timestamp is after the game's scheduled time. If the game was played, there should be a result. However, the search results provided don't include a final score for the June 8 game. The live score in [1] is from the 2nd inning, but without a completion status. Other results like [12] and [14] are highlights from the game but don't state the final outcome. \n\nGiven the user's previous response returned p4 (insufficient data), the system is asking to check alternative sources. The ancillary data says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The probable pitchers were Walter (0-0, 0.00 ERA) for Astros and Bibee (4-6, 3.89 ERA) for Guardians. However, without explicit confirmation of the result, it's risky to assume. \n\nBut result [12] and [14] show the Guardians leading 2-0 in the 2nd inning on June 8. If the game wasn't completed, perhaps due to postponement, but the current timestamp is after the scheduled time. However, there's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in the search results. \n\nWait, the user's personalization instructions say if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. The Guardians were at home, and Bibee had a 3.89 ERA but was 2-0 in day games. The Astros' Walter had a 0.00 ERA but limited starts. Without explicit results, perhaps the game was played, and the Guardians won based on the live score snippet. However, live scores can change, and the final result isn't confirmed here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game is still ongoing, but the current time is 8:03 PM UTC, which is 4:03 PM ET. Wait, the game was scheduled for 1:40 PM ET, so it should have ended around 4:40 PM ET, which is 8:40 PM UTC. The current timestamp is 8:03 PM UTC, so the game might still be in progress. However, the live score in [1] is from the 2nd inning, which would be early in the game. If the game is ongoing, the market can't be resolved yet, leading to p4. \n\nBut the user's personalization says if the event is scheduled for the same day but a later time, it's still future. However, the game's scheduled time was 1:40 PM ET, which is 5:40 PM UTC. The current time is 8:03 PM UTC, so the game should have started and possibly concluded. However, without a final result in the search results, it's unclear. \n\nGiven the conflicting information and lack of explicit final score, the safest recommendation is p4 (insufficient data) because the provided search results don't conclusively show the outcome of the June 8 game. The live score is from the 2nd inning, and other results refer to previous games. Therefore, without confirmation, the market can't be resolved.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Houston Astros vs. Cleveland Guardians game scheduled for June 8, 2025, at 1:40 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Astros win, it's p2 (Astros), Guardians win is p1, postponed remains open, and canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The provided timestamp is 2025-06-08 20:03:14 UTC, which is 8:03 PM UTC on June 8. The game was scheduled for 1:40 PM ET, which is 5:40 PM UTC. So the game should have already occurred by the current time. \n\nLooking at the search results, there are multiple sources mentioning the game on June 8. For example, result [1] is a live score from June 8, 2025, showing the game in progress with the Guardians leading 2-0 in the bottom of the 2nd inning. However, other results like [12] and [14] describe Bo Naylor hitting a two-run homer in the 2nd inning, which aligns with the live score. \n\nBut wait, there's a mix of dates in the search results. Some results mention June 7 (like [2], [3], [4], [9], [10], [16]), which was the previous day's game where the Astros won in extra innings. The user's query is specifically about the June 8 game. \n\nResult [11] from June 8 mentions the Guardians having a three-game losing streak and lists the probable pitchers as Brandon Walter for the Astros and Tanner Bibee for the Guardians. Result [12] and [14] show Bo Naylor's home run on June 8, indicating the game was played. Result [1] is a live score, but the current timestamp is after the game's scheduled time, so the live score might be from earlier in the day. \n\nHowever, result [15] from ESPN's matchup page on June 8 shows the final stats, but the content seems mixed with another game (Athletics vs. Rangers), which might be a red herring. The key is to find the final result of the June 8 game between Astros and Guardians. \n\nResult [12] and [14] both describe Bo Naylor's two-run homer in the 2nd inning on June 8, but they don't provide the final score. Result [1] shows the live score with Guardians leading 2-0 in the 2nd, but it's a live update, not the final. Result [7] mentions Tanner Bibee's strong outing on June 8, striking out six over 6.1 innings, which suggests he started and pitched well. \n\nLooking deeper, result [10] from MLB.com on June 8 discusses the Astros' 5-3 win in 10 innings on June 7 and mentions the upcoming game on June 8 with Walter vs. Bibee. But there's no direct mention of the June 8 game's outcome. \n\nWait, result [11] from the Lethbridge Herald on June 8 states the Guardians have a three-game losing streak and lists the probable starters for June 8 as Walter and Bibee. It also mentions the Guardians' record as 33-30 and the Astros as 36-28. However, this doesn't confirm the game's result. \n\nThe critical point is that the current timestamp is after the game's scheduled time. If the game was played, there should be a result. However, the search results provided don't include a final score for the June 8 game. The live score in [1] is from the 2nd inning, but without a completion status. Other results like [12] and [14] are highlights from the game but don't state the final outcome. \n\nGiven the user's previous response returned p4 (insufficient data), the system is asking to check alternative sources. The ancillary data says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The probable pitchers were Walter (0-0, 0.00 ERA) for Astros and Bibee (4-6, 3.89 ERA) for Guardians. However, without explicit confirmation of the result, it's risky to assume. \n\nBut result [12] and [14] show the Guardians leading 2-0 in the 2nd inning on June 8. If the game wasn't completed, perhaps due to postponement, but the current timestamp is after the scheduled time. However, there's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in the search results. \n\nWait, the user's personalization instructions say if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. The Guardians were at home, and Bibee had a 3.89 ERA but was 2-0 in day games. The Astros' Walter had a 0.00 ERA but limited starts. Without explicit results, perhaps the game was played, and the Guardians won based on the live score snippet. However, live scores can change, and the final result isn't confirmed here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game is still ongoing, but the current time is 8:03 PM UTC, which is 4:03 PM ET. Wait, the game was scheduled for 1:40 PM ET, so it should have ended around 4:40 PM ET, which is 8:40 PM UTC. The current timestamp is 8:03 PM UTC, so the game might still be in progress. However, the live score in [1] is from the 2nd inning, which would be early in the game. If the game is ongoing, the market can't be resolved yet, leading to p4. \n\nBut the user's personalization says if the event is scheduled for the same day but a later time, it's still future. However, the game's scheduled time was 1:40 PM ET, which is 5:40 PM UTC. The current time is 8:03 PM UTC, so the game should have started and possibly concluded. However, without a final result in the search results, it's unclear. \n\nGiven the conflicting information and lack of explicit final score, the safest recommendation is p4 (insufficient data) because the provided search results don't conclusively show the outcome of the June 8 game. The live score is from the 2nd inning, and other results refer to previous games. Therefore, without confirmation, the market can't be resolved.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Astros, Price: 0.0445, ID: 67354643498725414298659708114401120526176168238883930554383983386765775847301, Winner: No\n- Token: Guardians, Price: 0.9555, ID: 90144520196921621472086675814180580534843300747898389206029344597212651814036, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Guardians, p2 to Astros, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Guardians, p2 = Astros\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Guardians outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.956 = 95.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Houston Astros vs. Cleveland Guardians game scheduled for June 8, 2025, at 1:40 PM ET. The resolution depends on who wins, if the game is postponed, or canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is June 8, 2025, around 8 PM UTC, which is 4 PM ET. So the game was supposed to start at 1:40 PM ET, which is 5:40 PM UTC. The current time is past that, so the game should have started and possibly finished.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's a box score from CBS Sports (source 1) and Fox Sports (source 3) for the game on June 8. The box score shows the final score as Astros 2, Guardians 2 in the 7th inning, but the game might have gone into extra innings. Wait, source 1 mentions the 7th inning with the Astros scoring 2 runs to tie the game 2-2. However, source 9 and 16 describe a game on June 7 that went into extra innings, but the June 8 game is a different one.\n\nWait, source 1 is the box score for June 8. It shows the game going into the 7th inning with the score tied 2-2. But the detailed play-by-play in source 1 ends in the 7th inning. However, source 17 (MLB.com) mentions the Astros winning 5-3 in 10 innings on June 7, which is a different game. The June 8 game might have been a separate matchup. \n\nWait, the user's query is about the June 8 game. Let me check the sources again. Source 1's URL is for June 8, and the box score shows the game progressing into later innings. However, the detailed play-by-play stops at the 7th inning with the score tied 2-2. But source 16 (ESPN) from June 8 shows the final score as Astros 5, Guardians 3 in 10 innings. That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe there was a confusion between June 7 and June 8 games. \n\nLooking at source 9 and 16, they both mention the June 7 game going into extra innings, with the Astros winning 5-3. The June 8 game is a different one. However, source 1's box score for June 8 shows the game in progress, but the detailed play-by-play ends in the 7th inning. However, source 14 (YouTube highlights) for June 7 mentions a 5-3 Astros win in 10 innings, which aligns with source 9 and 16. \n\nWait, the user's query is about the June 8 game. Let me check source 1 again. The URL is for June 8, and the box score shows the game as Astros 2, Guardians 2 in the 7th inning. But the play-by-play stops there. However, source 4 mentions a game delay on June 8, 2025, at 12:59 PM update, with the start delayed due to weather. Then, at 2:31 PM, the game was scheduled to start at 3:15 PM. So the game might have been delayed but not postponed. \n\nIf the game started late, it might have continued into extra innings. However, the box score in source 1 doesn't show a final score. But source 16 (ESPN) for June 8 lists the final score as Astros 5, Guardians 3 in 10 innings. That must be the correct outcome. Therefore, the Astros won the June 8 game, so the market should resolve to p2 (Astros). \n\nWait, but the user's ancillary data says p1 is Guardians, p2 is Astros. So if the Astros won, the recommendation is p2. The confusion was because the initial box score didn't show the final, but the ESPN source confirms the Astros won in extra innings. Therefore, the correct resolution is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749412994 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-08 20:03:14 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4.

For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\"), college football (e.g., \"What was the score of the Alabama game last Saturday?\"), college basketball (e.g., \"What was Duke's score in their last game?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.
