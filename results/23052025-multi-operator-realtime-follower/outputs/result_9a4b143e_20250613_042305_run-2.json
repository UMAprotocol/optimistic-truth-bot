Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Bitcoin Up or Down - June 12, 11 PM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for BTC/USDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTC/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTC/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 551208\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality.

Recommendation found: p3.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p3\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.9975, ID: 15601472564908653909641822409526604312023149215745007873949343565515285265409, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.0025, ID: 100858632025553781617679446204174050154868609972586645957437342372109289769700, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.998 = 99.8% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

I need you to generate code to solve the following prediction market question:\n\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Bitcoin Up or Down - June 12, 11 PM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for BTC/USDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTC/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTC/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 551208\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Bitcoin Up or Down - June 12, 11 PM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for BTC/USDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTC/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTC/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 551208\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749788200 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-13 04:16:40 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p3. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Configure logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nconsole_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\nconsole_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nconsole_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\nlogger.addHandler(console_handler)\n\ndef get_btc_price_change(date_str, hour, minute, timezone_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches the percentage change for the BTC/USDT pair on Binance for the specified hour candle.\n\n    Args:\n        date_str: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format\n        hour: Hour in 24-hour format\n        minute: Minute\n        timezone_str: Timezone string\n\n    Returns:\n        Percentage change as float or None if data cannot be fetched.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        tz = pytz.timezone(timezone_str)\n        time_str = f\"{hour:02d}:{minute:02d}:00\"\n        target_time_local = tz.localize(\n            datetime.strptime(f\"{date_str} {time_str}\", \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n        )\n        target_time_utc = target_time_local.astimezone(timezone.utc)\n        start_time_ms = int(target_time_utc.timestamp() * 1000) - 3600000  # 1 hour before for the candle start\n\n        api_url = \"https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines\"\n        params = {\n            \"symbol\": \"BTCUSDT\",\n            \"interval\": \"1h\",\n            \"limit\": 1,\n            \"startTime\": start_time_ms,\n            \"endTime\": start_time_ms + 3600000  # 1 hour duration\n        }\n\n        response = requests.get(api_url, params=params)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n\n        if data:\n            open_price = float(data[0][1])\n            close_price = float(data[0][4])\n            price_change_percent = ((close_price - open_price) / open_price) * 100\n            return price_change_percent\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Failed to fetch or parse data: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to determine if the BTC/USDT price went up or down at the specified time.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Specific date and time for the query\n    date_str = \"2025-06-12\"\n    hour = 23  # 11 PM\n    minute = 0\n    timezone_str = \"US/Eastern\"\n\n    price_change_percent = get_btc_price_change(date_str, hour, minute, timezone_str)\n\n    if price_change_percent is None:\n        print(\"recommendation: p3\")  # Unknown/50-50 if data cannot be fetched\n    elif price_change_percent >= 0:\n        print(\"recommendation: p2\")  # Up\n    else:\n        print(\"recommendation: p1\")  # Down\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p3\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.998 = 99.8% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market that depends on whether the BTC/USDT 1-hour candle starting June 12 at 11 PM ET (which is June 13, 3 AM UTC) closed with a percentage change greater than or equal to 0. The resolution source is Binance's BTC/USDT pair, specifically the change value displayed for that 1H candle.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current time. The provided timestamp is June 13, 2025, 4:16:40 AM UTC. The candle in question started at June 13, 3 AM UTC and would close at 4 AM UTC. Since the current time is 4:16 AM UTC, the candle has already closed, and the data should be available.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources provide price data around that time. For example, result [4] mentions Bitcoin's price at 107,766.3 USD at 03:18 AM UTC on June 13. Result [6] shows the BTC/USDT price on Cex.io as 108,570 on June 12, 2025. However, the exact 1-hour candle from 3 AM to 4 AM UTC needs to be verified.\n\nResult [3] and [13] from TradingView indicate the BTCUSDT Futures Contract settled on June 13, 2025, with a price of 109,658.1 USDT, but this is a futures contract, not the spot price. The spot price is needed here.\n\nResult [25] from Binance's trade page shows the BTC/USDT spot price as 103,600.57, but the timestamp isn't clear. Result [19] from CoinGecko's historical data lists the close price on June 12 as $105,979 and June 13 as N/A, but the exact 1H candle data isn't directly provided.\n\nResult [39] from CoinEdition's price prediction for June 13 mentions Bitcoin testing support levels around $107,200\u2013$106,250, but this is a prediction, not actual data.\n\nThe key is to find the 1-hour candle's percentage change on Binance. Since the user specified using Binance's data, I should look for the exact change value. However, the provided search results don't explicitly state the percentage change for that specific 1H candle. \n\nGiven the current time is past the candle's close, and assuming the data is available, if the close price is higher than the open, it resolves to Up (p2). If not, Down (p1). Without explicit data in the search results, but considering the market's movement around that time, if the price increased from 3 AM to 4 AM UTC, the answer is p2. If it decreased, p1. Since the search results don't have the exact figure, but the ancillary data says to use Binance's displayed change, and if no data is found, assume the most probable outcome. However, the user instruction says if no verifiable info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. \n\nLooking at the surrounding data: result [4] mentions a price of 107,766.3 at 3:18 AM, and result [6] shows 108,570 on June 12. If the price at 3 AM was around 108,000 and closed at 107,766.3, that's a decrease. But without exact open and close prices, it's uncertain. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Given the ambiguity, but considering the time of the query is just after the candle close, and if the price was fluctuating around that time, it's possible the change was negative. But without concrete data, it's safer to resolve as p4 (cannot be resolved). However, the user instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The query's ancillary data defines p1 as Down, p2 as Up. If the change is >=0, p2. Otherwise, p1. Since the exact data isn't present in the search results, but the current timestamp is after the event, and the user expects a resolution, perhaps the answer is p2 if the price increased, else p1. But without explicit data, maybe p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. Given the lack of explicit data, but considering the market's state around that time, if the price was rising, maybe p2. But this is speculative. Alternatively, check if any sources mention the price movement during that hour. Result [4] mentions a price of 107,766.3 at 3:18 AM, and result [39] mentions a price prediction with a slight decrease. If the price was lower at 4 AM than at 3 AM, then p1. But without exact data, it's unclear. Since the resolution source is Binance's 1H candle change, and the data isn't provided in the search results, but the event is in the past, the correct resolution would be to check Binance's historical data. However, given the provided context, the assistant must make a determination. Since the search results don't have the exact percentage, but the user instruction says to answer as well as possible with existing knowledge, perhaps the assistant should infer based on nearby data. If the price at 3 AM was around 108,000 and at 4 AM it's 107,600, that's a negative change, so p1. But this is an assumption. Alternatively, if the price increased, p2. Without clear data, the safest is p4, but the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome. Given the ambiguity, but considering the time of the query is just after the candle close, and if the price was fluctuating, perhaps the change was negative. Therefore, resolve to p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to determine if the BTC/USDT 1-hour candle on June 12, 11 PM ET to June 13, 12 AM ET closed up or down based on Binance data. The resolution depends on the percentage change of that specific candle.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp given is June 13, 2025, 4:16:40 UTC. The event in question is the 1-hour candle starting at June 12, 11 PM ET, which is equivalent to June 13, 3:00 AM UTC (since ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time). The candle ends at June 13, 4:00 AM UTC. Since the current time is 4:16 AM UTC, the candle has already closed, and the data should be available.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources provide historical data from Binance. Result [1] and [15] mention datasets updated daily via Binance API, including 1-hour candles. Result [5] and [22] include 4-hour data but don't cover the specific hour. Result [12] shows the BTC/USDT price on TradingView as 104,172.00 USDT with a 1.11% drop in 24 hours, but that's the daily change, not the specific 1-hour window.\n\nResult [24] provides Bitcoin's historical data, showing June 12 closing at $105,979 and June 13 at $104,152.13. However, these are daily closes, not the 1-hour candle. Result [38] mentions a price prediction article, but it's from May 2025 and not relevant here.\n\nResult [37] from Binance Square on November 11, 2024, discusses a 1-minute candle, but the date doesn't match. Result [39] from February 2025 talks about futures activity, which isn't directly relevant. \n\nThe key here is to find the exact 1-hour candle data. Since the current time is past the candle's close, the data should be available. The user specified using Binance's BTC/USDT pair, so the percentage change for that exact hour needs to be checked. \n\nGiven the ancillary data, if the change is >=0%, it's \"Up\" (p2), else \"Down\" (p1). The sources don't explicitly state the exact percentage for that hour, but result [24] shows a drop from June 12 to 13. However, that's daily. Without the exact 1-hour data, but knowing the event date has passed, I should infer based on available data. \n\nWait, the current date in the system is June 13, 2025, and the candle in question is from June 12, 11 PM ET to June 13, 12 AM ET. Since the data is available, and the user insists on Binance's data, perhaps the 1-hour candle closed with a negative change. However, without explicit data in the search results, I might need to rely on the fact that the event has occurred and the data is final. \n\nBut the user provided search results up to [49], which includes Binance data up to June 13. Result [8] mentions oil price impact on June 13, 2025, at 2 PM UTC, but that's after the candle. Result [12] on TradingView shows BTC/USDT at 104,172, down 1.11% in 24 hours, but again, not the specific hour. \n\nSince the exact 1-hour change isn't directly listed, but the user requires using Binance data, perhaps the answer is p2 (Up) if the change is non-negative. However, given the overall negative daily movement, it's possible the specific hour was down. But without explicit data, maybe the most probable outcome is p2 if the candle closed up. Wait, the user instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. But the ancillary data says p1 is Down, p2 is Up. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1-hour candle had a positive change. But without concrete data, it's challenging. However, the user provided a Python code instruction. Let me check if any search results include code to fetch Binance historical data. Result [2], [14], [17], [21], [27], [30], [32], [33] discuss API methods. For example, using the python-binance library to fetch historical klines. \n\nSince the current time is after the candle close, executing code to fetch the 1-hour candle for June 13, 3:00 AM UTC (start time) would give the open, close, etc. The percentage change can be calculated. \n\nAssuming I can write Python code using the Binance API to retrieve the specific candle:\n\nfrom binance.client import Client\nclient = Client()\nklines = client.get_historical_klines(\"BTCUSDT\", Client.KLINE_INTERVAL_1HOUR, \"2025-06-13 03:00:00\", \"2025-06-13 04:00:00\")\nopen_price = float(klines[1])\nclose_price = float(klines[4])\nchange_percent = ((close_price - open_price) / open_price) * 100\nif change_percent >= 0:\n    recommendation = \"p2\"\nelse:\n    recommendation = \"p1\"\n\nBut since I can't execute code here, I need to infer from search results. Result [24] shows June 12 closing at $105,979 and June 13 at $104,152.13, a drop. But that's daily. The specific hour might have varied. \n\nAlternatively, result [12] on TradingView shows the current price as 104,172, down 1.11% in 24h. If the specific hour was part of a downward trend, maybe it was negative. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit data for that exact hour, but the event date has passed, and assuming the data is available, the resolution should be based on the actual change. Since the user insists on Binance data and the change is not provided in the search results, but the ancillary data says to resolve based on Binance's displayed change for the 1H candle, and the current time is after the candle close, the correct resolution would be to check that change. \n\nHowever, without the exact figure, but considering the overall negative daily movement, it's possible the 1-hour candle was down. Therefore, the recommendation would be p1 (Down). But I need to be certain. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But if the event date is in the past, and no info, but the user provided URLs, we must use those. The search results include data up to June 13, but not the specific candle. \n\nAlternatively, result [24] has a table with June 13 data, but the close is N/A. The previous day's close is $105,979, and the current price is $104,152.13, indicating a drop. If the 1-hour candle was part of this drop, maybe it was negative. \n\nBut without explicit data, the safest recommendation is p4 (cannot resolve), but the user says if the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. However, the instructions say if the event is in the past and no verifiable info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but the user's additional instruction to use Binance data, and considering that the 1-hour candle's change isn't explicitly found, but the daily trend is down, I'll infer the 1-hour candle was likely down, hence p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Result [39] from February 2025 talks about futures activity, which isn't directly relevant. \n\nThe key here is to find the exact 1-hour candle data. Since the current time is past the candle's close, the data should be available. The user specified using Binance's BTC/USDT pair, so the percentage change for that exact hour needs to be checked. \n\nGiven the ancillary data, if the change is >=0%, it's \"Up\" (p2), else \"Down\" (p1). The sources don't explicitly state the exact percentage for that hour, but result [24] shows a drop from June 12 to 13. However, that's daily. Without the exact 1-hour data, but knowing the event date has passed, I should infer based on available data. \n\nWait, the current date in the system is June 13, 2025, and the candle in question is from June 12, 11 PM ET to June 13, 12 AM ET. Since the data is available, and the user insists on Binance's data, perhaps the 1-hour candle closed with a negative change. However, without explicit data in the search results, I might need to rely on the fact that the event has occurred and the data is final. \n\nBut the user provided search results up to [49], which includes Binance data up to June 13. Result [8] mentions oil price impact on June 13, 2025, at 2 PM UTC, but that's after the candle. Result [12] on TradingView shows BTC/USDT at 104,172, down 1.11% in 24 hours, but again, not the specific hour. \n\nSince the exact 1-hour change isn't directly listed, but the user requires using Binance data, perhaps the answer is p2 (Up) if the change is non-negative. However, given the overall negative daily movement, it's possible the specific hour was down. But without explicit data, maybe the most probable outcome is p2 if the candle closed up. Wait, the user instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. But the ancillary data says p1 is Down, p2 is Up. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1-hour candle had a positive change. But without concrete data, it's challenging. However, the user provided a Python code instruction. Let me check if any search results include code to fetch Binance historical data. Result [2], [14], [17], [21], [27], [30], [32], [33] discuss API methods. For example, using the python-binance library to fetch historical klines. \n\nSince the current time is after the candle close, executing code to fetch the 1-hour candle for June 13, 3:00 AM UTC (start time) would give the open, close, etc. The percentage change can be calculated. \n\nAssuming I can write Python code using the Binance API to retrieve the specific candle:\n\nfrom binance.client import Client\nclient = Client()\nklines = client.get_historical_klines(\"BTCUSDT\", Client.KLINE_INTERVAL_1HOUR, \"2025-06-13 03:00:00\", \"2025-06-13 04:00:00\")\nopen_price = float(klines[1])\nclose_price = float(klines[4])\nchange_percent = ((close_price - open_price) / open_price) * 100\nif change_percent >= 0:\n    recommendation = \"p2\"\nelse:\n    recommendation = \"p1\"\n\nBut since I can't execute code here, I need to infer from search results. Result [24] shows June 12 closing at $105,979 and June 13 at $104,152.13, a drop. But that's daily. The specific hour might have varied. \n\nAlternatively, result [12] on TradingView shows the current price as 104,172, down 1.11% in 24h. If the specific hour was part of a downward trend, maybe it was negative. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit data for that exact hour, but the event date has passed, and assuming the data is available, the resolution should be based on the actual change. Since the user insists on Binance data and the change is not provided in the search results, but the ancillary data says to resolve based on Binance's displayed change for the 1H candle, and the current time is after the candle close, the correct resolution would be to check that change. \n\nHowever, without the exact figure, but considering the overall negative daily movement, it's possible the 1-hour candle was down. Therefore, the recommendation would be p1 (Down). But I need to be certain. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But if the event date is in the past, and no info, but the user provided URLs, we must use those. The search results include data up to June 13, but not the specific candle. \n\nAlternatively, result [24] has a table with June 13 data, but the close is N/A. The previous day's close is $105,979, and the current price is $104,152.13, indicating a drop. If the 1-hour candle was part of this drop, maybe it was negative. \n\nBut without explicit data, the safest recommendation is p4 (cannot resolve), but the user says if the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. However, the instructions say if the event is in the past and no verifiable info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but the user's additional instruction to use Binance data, and considering that the 1-hour candle's change isn't explicitly found, but the daily trend is down, I'll infer the 1-hour candle was likely down, hence p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.9975, ID: 15601472564908653909641822409526604312023149215745007873949343565515285265409, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.0025, ID: 100858632025553781617679446204174050154868609972586645957437342372109289769700, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.998 = 99.8% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.
