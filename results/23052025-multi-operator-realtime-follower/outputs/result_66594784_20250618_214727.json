      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking about a prediction market resolution regarding Karen Read's trial. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if she's acquitted of all charges by the end of 2025. The ancillary data specifies the charges and resolution conditions. The updates mention that on June 18, 2025, she was acquitted of all listed charges.\n\nFirst, I need to verify the verdict using the provided search results. Let's check the sources. \n\nSearch result [1] states she was found not guilty in the retrial. [2] mentions she was acquitted of most charges, guilty only of operating under the influence. [3] and [4] confirm the acquittal on the serious charges. [5] and [16] also note she was found not guilty of murder and leaving the scene but guilty of OUI. \n\nThe key point here is the market's condition: if she's not guilty of any of the three charges, it resolves to \"Yes\". However, she was found guilty of operating under the influence, which is part of the vehicular manslaughter charge. Wait, the charges listed are second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter while under the influence, and leaving the scene. The verdicts from the sources show she was acquitted of second-degree murder and leaving the scene but convicted of OUI. However, the manslaughter charge might have a lesser included offense. \n\nLooking at [5], the jury found her guilty of the lesser offense of operating under the influence. The manslaughter charge might have been split into the main charge and a lesser one. The market's resolution depends on whether the guilty verdict on OUI is part of the listed charges. The ancillary data specifies \"vehicular manslaughter while under the influence\" as one charge. If the guilty verdict is a lesser included offense under that charge, then she was found guilty of at least one charge, so the market resolves to \"No\". \n\nBut the update provided by the user states she was acquitted of all listed charges. However, according to the sources, she was convicted of OUI, which might be a separate charge or a lesser included one. The market's description says if she's found guilty of even one charge, it's \"No\". Since she was found guilty of OUI, which is part of the vehicular manslaughter charge, the market should resolve to \"No\". But the user's update says she was acquitted of all listed charges. There's a discrepancy here. \n\nWait, the update says she was acquitted of all listed charges, but according to the sources, she was convicted of OUI. The charges in the market are the three listed. The OUI might be a separate charge or a lesser included. The ancillary data's charges include vehicular manslaughter while under the influence. If the jury found her guilty of OUI as a lesser charge under the manslaughter count, then she was convicted on that charge, making the market resolve to \"No\". However, the user's update claims she was acquitted of all listed charges, which might be incorrect based on the sources. \n\nBut according to the search results, the verdict was not guilty on murder and leaving the scene, guilty of OUI. The market's resolution depends on whether OUI is considered one of the charges. The ancillary data lists three charges: second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter while under the influence, and leaving the scene. The OUI conviction might be a separate charge or a lesser included. If the vehicular manslaughter charge was split into a lesser offense (OUI), then she was convicted on that, hence \"No\". But the update says she was acquitted of all listed charges, which might be a mistake. \n\nWait, the user's update states: \"acquitted of all listed charges\". But according to the sources, she was found guilty of operating under the influence. The market's description includes \"vehicular manslaughter while under the influence\" as a charge. If the OUI is a separate charge, then the market's listed charges don't include it, but the sources indicate the charges were second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter while under the influence, and leaving the scene. The guilty verdict on OUI might be a lesser included offense under the vehicular manslaughter charge. In that case, being found guilty of a lesser charge under one of the listed charges would still count as a guilty verdict on that charge, leading to \"No\". However, the update provided by the user claims she was acquitted of all listed charges, which contradicts the sources. \n\nThis is confusing. The user's update might be incorrect. According to the search results, she was found guilty of OUI, which is part of the charges. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"No\". But the update says she was acquitted of all charges. Need to check the exact charges. \n\nLooking at [16], the charges were second-degree murder, manslaughter while operating under the influence, and leaving the scene. The jury found her guilty of operating under the influence, which is a lesser charge under the manslaughter count. Therefore, she was convicted on that charge, making the market resolve to \"No\". However, the user's update says she was acquitted of all listed charges, which might be a mistake. \n\nBut the user provided an update with a timestamp, which states she was acquitted of all listed charges. The resolution should consider the update as per the instructions: \"If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality.\" The update says she was acquitted of all listed charges, so despite the sources indicating a guilty verdict on OUI, the update takes precedence. Therefore, the market resolves to \"Yes\". \n\nBut wait, the update might be incorrect. The sources clearly state she was found guilty of OUI. However, the user's instruction says to heavily bias towards the provided URLs. The update is part of the user's input, so according to the personalization instructions, if the user provides updates, we must use them to update the analysis. Therefore, even if the sources suggest a guilty verdict, the update says she was acquitted, so the resolution is \"Yes\". \n\nBut the update's text has some encoding issues: \"acquitted of all listed charges\\xe2\\x80\\x94second-degree murder...\" The \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is likely an em dash. The update states she was acquitted of all listed charges. Therefore, per the update, the market resolves to \"Yes\". \n\nHowever, the sources indicate she was convicted of OUI. There's a conflict here. The personalization instructions say to prioritize the user's updates. Therefore, the resolution should follow the update, leading to \"Yes\". But need to confirm if the OUI charge is part of the listed charges. The listed charges are the three mentioned. If the OUI is a separate charge not listed, then the market's resolution is based on the three listed charges. But the update says she was acquitted of all listed charges, so \"Yes\". \n\nAlternatively, if the OUI is a lesser charge under the vehicular manslaughter count, then being found guilty of that would mean she was convicted on that charge, making the market resolve to \"No\". But the update says she was acquitted of all listed charges, which might mean the OUI is a separate charge not included in the market's listed charges. \n\nThe market's description says the charges are the three listed. If the OUI is a separate charge not part of the three, then the market only considers the three. If she was acquitted of all three, then \"Yes\". But according to the sources, the three charges were second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter while under the influence, and leaving the scene. The jury found her not guilty of murder and leaving the scene, but guilty of OUI as a lesser charge under the vehicular manslaughter count. Therefore, she was convicted on the vehicular manslaughter charge (via the lesser offense), making the market resolve to \"No\". \n\nBut the user's update says she was acquitted of all listed charges. This is conflicting. The personalization instructions say to use the updates to bias the analysis. Therefore, despite the sources, the update takes precedence. Hence, the resolution is \"Yes\". \n\nBut I need to check the exact charges. The market's listed charges are second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter while under the influence, and leaving the scene. The verdicts were not guilty on murder and leaving the scene, and guilty of OUI. If the OUI is a lesser included offense under the vehicular manslaughter charge, then she was convicted on that charge, hence \"No\". If the OUI is a separate charge not listed in the market, then the market's resolution is based on the three listed charges, which she was acquitted of, leading to \"Yes\". \n\nThe market's description says the charges are the three listed. The OUI conviction is part of the vehicular manslaughter charge as a lesser offense. Therefore, she was convicted on that charge, making the market resolve to \"No\". However, the user's update claims she was acquitted of all listed charges. This is a contradiction. \n\nThe personalization instructions state: \"If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and heavily bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality.\" Therefore, even if the sources suggest a conviction, the update says acquitted, so the resolution is \"Yes\". \n\nBut the update might be incorrect. However, according to the instructions, the user's updates must be followed. Therefore, the answer is \"Yes\", p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750282876 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-18 21:41:16 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking about a prediction market resolution regarding Karen Read's trial. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if she's acquitted of all charges by the end of 2025. The ancillary data specifies the charges and resolution conditions. The updates mention that on June 18, 2025, she was acquitted of all listed charges.\n\nFirst, I need to verify the verdict using the provided search results. Let's check the sources. \n\nSearch result [1] states she was found not guilty in the retrial. [2] mentions she was acquitted of most charges, guilty only of operating under the influence. [3] and [4] confirm the acquittal on the serious charges. [5] and [16] also note she was found not guilty of murder and leaving the scene but guilty of OUI. \n\nThe key point here is the market's condition: if she's not guilty of any of the three charges, it resolves to \"Yes\". However, she was found guilty of operating under the influence, which is part of the vehicular manslaughter charge. Wait, the charges listed are second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter while under the influence, and leaving the scene. The verdicts from the sources show she was acquitted of second-degree murder and leaving the scene but convicted of OUI. However, the manslaughter charge might have a lesser included offense. \n\nLooking at [5], the jury found her guilty of the lesser offense of operating under the influence. The manslaughter charge might have been split into the main charge and a lesser one. The market's resolution depends on whether the guilty verdict on OUI is part of the listed charges. The ancillary data specifies \"vehicular manslaughter while under the influence\" as one charge. If the guilty verdict is a lesser included offense under that charge, then she was found guilty of at least one charge, so the market resolves to \"No\". \n\nBut the update provided by the user states she was acquitted of all listed charges. However, according to the sources, she was convicted of OUI, which might be a separate charge or a lesser included one. The market's description says if she's found guilty of even one charge, it's \"No\". Since she was found guilty of OUI, which is part of the vehicular manslaughter charge, the market should resolve to \"No\". But the user's update says she was acquitted of all listed charges. There's a discrepancy here. \n\nWait, the update says she was acquitted of all listed charges, but according to the sources, she was convicted of OUI. The charges in the market are the three listed. The OUI might be a separate charge or a lesser included. The ancillary data's charges include vehicular manslaughter while under the influence. If the jury found her guilty of OUI as a lesser charge under the manslaughter count, then she was convicted on that charge, making the market resolve to \"No\". However, the user's update claims she was acquitted of all listed charges, which might be incorrect based on the sources. \n\nBut according to the search results, the verdict was not guilty on murder and leaving the scene, guilty of OUI. The market's resolution depends on whether OUI is considered one of the charges. The ancillary data lists three charges: second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter while under the influence, and leaving the scene. The OUI conviction might be a separate charge or a lesser included. If the vehicular manslaughter charge was split into a lesser offense (OUI), then she was convicted on that, hence \"No\".

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking about resolving a prediction market based on Karen Read's trial outcome. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Yes\" if she's acquitted of all charges by the end of 2025. The charges are second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter while under the influence, and leaving the scene of a collision causing death. The resolution conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 50-50.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The key points from the sources indicate that on June 18, 2025, Karen Read was found not guilty of the murder and manslaughter charges but was convicted of operating under the influence (OUI). For example, source [2] states she was found guilty of OUI but not guilty of murder and leaving the scene. Similarly, source [13] mentions she was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter but guilty of drunken driving.\n\nThe user's update note from June 18, 2025, says she was acquitted of all listed charges. However, according to the trial results, she was convicted of OUI, which is a lesser charge under the vehicular manslaughter while under the influence count. The market's resolution depends on whether she was found guilty of any of the three specific charges listed. Since OUI is part of the vehicular manslaughter charge, a conviction on that would mean the market resolves to \"No\".\n\nBut the user's update seems to contradict the search results, stating she was acquitted of all listed charges. This discrepancy needs clarification. The update might be considering only the top charges, but according to the trial verdicts, she was found guilty of OUI, which is a part of the vehicular manslaughter charge. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"No\" because she was convicted of at least one charge. However, the user's provided update says she was acquitted of all listed charges, which might be an error or a misinterpretation. \n\nGiven the official court verdicts from the sources, the correct resolution should be \"No\" because she was found guilty of OUI, which is a charge under the vehicular manslaughter count. The update provided by the user might be incorrect. But since the user included an update stating she was acquitted of all charges, there's a conflict. However, the resolution should rely on the actual trial outcomes as per the sources, not the user's update if it's inaccurate. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation should be p2: Yes if the update is accurate, but according to the sources, it's p1: No. But the user's update says she was acquitted of all listed charges, which might override the sources. Wait, the user's update is part of the input, so perhaps the resolution should follow that. However, the assistant must verify against the sources. The sources clearly state she was convicted of OUI, which is a charge under the vehicular manslaughter count. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). The user's update might be a mistake. The assistant should rely on the provided search results which indicate a guilty verdict on one charge. Hence, the recommendation is p1: No.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\n**Analysis:**  \nThe market resolves to \"Yes\" only if Karen Read is acquitted of **all three specified charges**. While search results confirm Read was acquitted of second-degree murder and leaving the scene[1][2][13], she was **convicted of operating under the influence (OUI)**[2][13][56], which falls under the \"vehicular manslaughter while under the influence\" charge listed in the ancillary data.  \n\nThe OUI conviction constitutes a guilty verdict on one of the enumerated charges, triggering a \"No\" resolution (p1). The user-provided update claiming acquittal on \"all listed charges\" appears inconsistent with the trial outcome documented in the search results. Resolution must align with the verified verdict, not the conflicting update.",

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors YES outcome (0.806 = 80.6% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking about the resolution of a prediction market regarding Karen Read's trial. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if she's acquitted of all charges by the end of 2025. The ancillary data defines p2 as \"Yes\" and p1 as \"No\". The user provided updates stating she was acquitted of all listed charges on June 18, 2025.\n\nFirst, I need to verify the charges she faced and the verdict. The search results [1], [2], [3], [6], [8], [12], [15], [17], [18] all mention the charges: second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter while under the influence (OUI), and leaving the scene. The verdicts from these sources consistently state she was found not guilty of murder and leaving the scene but guilty of OUI. However, the user's update says she was acquitted of all listed charges. Wait, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nLooking closer, the update says she was acquitted of all listed charges, but the sources indicate she was convicted of OUI. The OUI charge might be a lesser included offense under vehicular manslaughter while under the influence. The charges in the market are second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter while under the influence, and leaving the scene. If the jury found her guilty of OUI as a lesser charge under vehicular manslaughter, then she was convicted of that charge, which is part of the listed charges. However, the user's update claims she was acquitted of all listed charges. This needs clarification.\n\nWait, the update provided by the user states: \"On June 18, 2025, Karen Read was acquitted of all listed charges\u2014second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter while under the influence, and leaving the scene of a collision causing death.\" But according to the sources, she was found guilty of OUI. So, is OUI considered part of the vehicular manslaughter charge? In the court documents, the charges are structured such that vehicular manslaughter while under the influence includes OUI as an element. If the jury found her guilty of OUI as a lesser offense, that might mean she was convicted of a lesser charge under the vehicular manslaughter count. However, the market's resolution conditions specify that if she's found guilty of even one charge, it resolves to \"No\". The user's update seems to contradict the sources, but the update is part of the input and must be considered.\n\nThe user's update is crucial here. The market resolution depends on the first verdict. The update states she was acquitted of all listed charges, which would mean the market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2). However, the sources show she was convicted of OUI, which is a charge under the vehicular manslaughter count. But the user's update overrides the sources because the instructions say to heavily bias towards the provided URLs and updates. The update says she was acquitted of all listed charges, so even if the sources mention a guilty verdict on OUI, the update takes precedence. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2). But I need to ensure that the OUI conviction is not part of the listed charges. The listed charges include vehicular manslaughter while under the influence. If the OUI is a separate charge, then the update is incorrect. However, according to the search results, the charges were second-degree murder, manslaughter while operating under the influence, and leaving the scene. The jury found her guilty of OUI, which might be a lesser included offense under the manslaughter charge. In that case, she was convicted of a charge related to the listed ones, which would mean the market resolves to \"No\". But the user's update says she was acquitted of all listed charges, which might mean the OUI is a separate charge not included in the market's list. Wait, the market's listed charges are second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter while under the influence, and leaving the scene. The OUI conviction is a separate charge, but according to the sources, the manslaughter charge was split into OUI as a lesser offense. So, if the jury found her guilty of OUI instead of vehicular manslaughter, then she wasn't convicted of the listed vehicular manslaughter charge but a lesser charge. However, the market's resolution conditions state that if she's found guilty of even one charge, it's \"No\". The OUI is a charge, so even if it's a lesser charge, the market resolves to \"No\". But the user's update says she was acquitted of all listed charges, which might mean the OUI is not considered one of the listed charges. This is confusing. The key is to check the exact charges in the market versus the verdict. The market's charges are the three listed: murder, vehicular manslaughter (OUI), and leaving the scene. The verdict was not guilty on murder and leaving the scene, guilty on OUI. If the OUI is part of the vehicular manslaughter charge as a lesser offense, then she was convicted of a charge under that count, which would mean the market resolves to \"No\". However, the user's update explicitly states she was acquitted of all listed charges, including vehicular manslaughter. This suggests that the OUI conviction is a separate charge not included in the market's list. But according to the sources, the charges were murder, vehicular manslaughter while under the influence, and leaving the scene. The jury found her guilty of OUI, which was a lesser charge under the vehicular manslaughter count. Therefore, she was convicted of a charge related to the listed ones, which would mean the market resolves to \"No\". However, the user's update says she was acquitted of all listed charges, which contradicts the sources. The instructions say to prioritize the user-provided updates. Therefore, despite the sources indicating a guilty verdict on OUI, the update states she was acquitted of all charges, so the market resolves to \"Yes\". But this needs to be reconciled. The update might be incorrect, but according to the problem's instructions, the user-provided updates must be followed. Therefore, the resolution should be p2 (Yes).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors YES outcome (0.806 = 80.6% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.
