      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump mentioned \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" between May 17, 12:00 PM ET and May 23, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The resolution depends on any verbal mentions recorded in audio or video that's publicly accessible. Written statements don't count.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any events or speeches Trump had during that timeframe. The key dates here are May 17 to May 23, 2025. Let's look through the sources.\n\nSearch result [1] mentions a dinner on May 23 where Trump spoke about crypto. The article says he stood behind a lectern with the presidential seal and touted the industry. There's also a quote from him on Air Force One saying, \u201cI\u2019m a big crypto fan,\u201d which was during a trip to the Middle East last week. Wait, the trip was in May 2025, but the article's date is May 23, 2025. The dinner was on May 23, so that's within the timeframe. The article also mentions a video of Trump entering a private reception where he says, \u201cDid you get to see the helicopter?\u201d but that's not a mention of crypto or Bitcoin.\n\nSearch result [2] is similar to [1], also mentioning the May 23 dinner and the Air Force One comment. The exact quote is, \u201cI\u2019m a big crypto fan,\u201d from the Middle East trip. The trip dates are important here. The user's timeframe starts on May 17, so if the trip was after that, the mention counts. The article's date is May 22, 2025, so the trip was likely the previous week, but the exact date isn't clear. Wait, the article says \"last week\u2019s trip to the Middle East,\" which would be around May 16-17. If the comment was made during that trip, it might be outside the timeframe. Hmm, need to check the exact date of the Air Force One comment.\n\nLooking at search result [11], there's a confrontation on Air Force One on May 14, 2025, where Trump says, \u201cI\u2019m a big crypto fan, I will tell you. I\u2019ve been that from the beginning, right from the campaign.\u201d May 14 is before the timeframe starts on May 17, so that doesn't count. However, the dinner on May 23 is within the timeframe. The article mentions that Trump spoke for about half an hour at the dinner. If during that speech he mentioned \"crypto\" or \"Bitcoin,\" that would count. The article doesn't provide a direct quote, but it's implied he discussed the industry. However, without a specific mention, it's uncertain.\n\nSearch result [3] is a White House fact sheet from March 6, 2025, about establishing a Bitcoin reserve. That's outside the timeframe. Search result [4] is a YouTube video of a crypto summit on March 7, 2025, also outside the timeframe. Search result [5] is a Bloomberg video from May 20, 2025, discussing the upcoming dinner. It mentions Trump's support for crypto but doesn't include a verbal mention within the timeframe.\n\nSearch result [6] is a YouTube video from March 3, 2025, about the strategic crypto reserve, outside the timeframe. Search result [7] is a CBS video from May 22, 2025, discussing the dinner but no specific verbal mentions. Search result [8] is the White House live page, which on May 23 shows Trump participating in a MAHA Commission event. The transcript isn't provided, but if he spoke about crypto there, it might count. However, the MAHA event is about health, so maybe not. Search result [12] mentions a MAHA event on May 22, 2025, but the discussion was about digital asset frameworks. If Trump spoke there and mentioned \"crypto,\" that would count. The article says, \"policy discussions included digital asset frameworks,\" but it's unclear if Trump himself mentioned the terms.\n\nSearch result [9] is another article about the May 23 dinner, similar to [1] and [2]. It mentions Trump's speech but no direct quotes. Search result [10] discusses Trump's crypto investments but no verbal mentions. Search result [13] is from 2024, so irrelevant. Search result [14] is about a Middle East trip departing on May 13, 2025, which is before the timeframe. Search result [15] and [16] are from 2021, so too old. Search result [17] and [18] discuss the May 23 dinner but don't provide specific quotes from Trump during the event.\n\nPutting this together, the key events within the timeframe are the MAHA Commission event on May 22 and the crypto dinner on May 23. The MAHA event's focus was health, but if Trump mentioned crypto there, it would count. The dinner speech is the most likely place he would have mentioned \"crypto.\" However, the articles don't provide a direct quote, only stating he touted the industry. Without a specific recorded mention, it's uncertain. However, given the context of the event being a crypto dinner, it's highly probable he used the term \"crypto\" in his speech. Since the White House live feed ([8]) doesn't provide a transcript, but the dinner was a crypto-focused event, it's reasonable to infer he mentioned \"crypto.\" Therefore, the resolution should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1748003057 Current Date and Time: 2025-05-23 12:24:17 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump mentioned \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" between May 17, 12:00 PM ET and May 23, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The resolution depends on any verbal mentions recorded in audio or video that's publicly accessible. Written statements don't count.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any events or speeches Trump had during that timeframe. The key dates here are May 17 to May 23, 2025. Let's look through the sources.\n\nSearch result [1] mentions a dinner on May 23 where Trump spoke about crypto. The article says he stood behind a lectern with the presidential seal and touted the industry. There's also a quote from him on Air Force One saying, \u201cI\u2019m a big crypto fan,\u201d which was during a trip to the Middle East last week. Wait, the trip was in May 2025, but the article's date is May 23, 2025. The dinner was on May 23, so that's within the timeframe. The article also mentions a video of Trump entering a private reception where he says, \u201cDid you get to see the helicopter?\u201d but that's not a mention of crypto or Bitcoin.\n\nSearch result [2] is similar to [1], also mentioning the May 23 dinner and the Air Force One comment. The exact quote is, \u201cI\u2019m a big crypto fan,\u201d from the Middle East trip. The trip dates are important here. The user's timeframe starts on May 17, so if the trip was after that, the mention counts. The article's date is May 22, 2025, so the trip was likely the previous week, but the exact date isn't clear. Wait, the article says \"last week\u2019s trip to the Middle East,\" which would be around May 16-17. If the comment was made during that trip, it might be outside the timeframe. Hmm, need to check the exact date of the Air Force One comment.\n\nLooking at search result [11], there's a confrontation on Air Force One on May 14, 2025, where Trump says, \u201cI\u2019m a big crypto fan, I will tell you. I\u2019ve been that from the beginning, right from the campaign.\u201d May 14 is before the timeframe starts on May 17, so that doesn't count. However, the dinner on May 23 is within the timeframe. The article mentions that Trump spoke for about half an hour at the dinner. If during that speech he mentioned \"crypto\" or \"Bitcoin,\" that would count. The article doesn't provide a direct quote, but it's implied he discussed the industry. However, without a specific mention, it's uncertain.\n\nSearch result [3] is a White House fact sheet from March 6, 2025, about establishing a Bitcoin reserve. That's outside the timeframe. Search result [4] is a YouTube video of a crypto summit on March 7, 2025, also outside the timeframe. Search result [5] is a Bloomberg video from May 20, 2025, discussing the upcoming dinner. It mentions Trump's support for crypto but doesn't include a verbal mention within the timeframe.\n\nSearch result [6] is a YouTube video from March 3, 2025, about the strategic crypto reserve, outside the timeframe. Search result [7] is a CBS video from May 22, 2025, discussing the dinner but no specific verbal mentions. Search result [8] is the White House live page, which on May 23 shows Trump participating in a MAHA Commission event. The transcript isn't provided, but if he spoke about crypto there, it might count. However, the MAHA event is about health, so maybe not. Search result [12] mentions a MAHA event on May 22, 2025, but the discussion was about digital asset frameworks. If Trump spoke there and mentioned \"crypto,\" that would count. The article says, \"policy discussions included digital asset frameworks,\" but it's unclear if Trump himself mentioned the terms.\n\nSearch result [9] is another article about the May 23 dinner, similar to [1] and [2]. It mentions Trump's speech but no direct quotes. Search result [10] discusses Trump's crypto investments but no verbal mentions. Search result [13] is from 2024, so irrelevant. Search result [14] is about a Middle East trip departing on May 13, 2025, which is before the timeframe. Search result [15] and [16] are from 2021, so too old. Search result [17] and [18] discuss the May 23 dinner but don't provide specific quotes from Trump during the event.\n\nPutting this together, the key events within the timeframe are the MAHA Commission event on May 22 and the crypto dinner on May 23. The MAHA event's focus was health, but if Trump mentioned crypto there, it would count. The dinner speech is the most likely place he would have mentioned \"crypto.\" However, the articles don't provide a direct quote, only stating he touted the industry. Without a specific recorded mention, it's uncertain. However, given the context of the event being a crypto dinner, it's highly probable he used the term \"crypto\" in his speech. Since the White House live feed ([8]) doesn't provide a transcript, but the dinner was a crypto-focused event, it's reasonable to infer he mentioned \"crypto.\" Therefore, the resolution should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 1, ID: 72490026108262127027650451747874502152149149290133141621889791979933312245589, Winner: Yes\n- Token: No, Price: 0, ID: 58393238174866204329696607961925657968944093259298967796800851817369902010144, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
