Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Bitcoin Up or Down - June 11, 1 AM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for BTCUSDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTCUSDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTCUSDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 550874\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749622083 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-11 06:08:03 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Configure logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nconsole_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\nconsole_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nconsole_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\nlogger.addHandler(console_handler)\n\ndef get_btc_price_change(date_str, hour, minute, timezone_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches the percentage change for the BTCUSDT pair on Binance for the specified time.\n\n    Args:\n        date_str: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format\n        hour: Hour in 24-hour format\n        minute: Minute\n        timezone_str: Timezone string\n\n    Returns:\n        A string indicating the resolution based on the price change.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Convert the target time to UTC timestamp\n        tz = pytz.timezone(timezone_str)\n        time_str = f\"{hour:02d}:{minute:02d}:00\"\n        target_time_local = tz.localize(\n            datetime.strptime(f\"{date_str} {time_str}\", \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n        )\n        target_time_utc = target_time_local.astimezone(timezone.utc)\n        start_time_ms = int(target_time_utc.timestamp() * 1000)\n\n        # Binance API endpoint for 1-hour candle data\n        api_url = \"https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines\"\n        params = {\n            \"symbol\": \"BTCUSDT\",\n            \"interval\": \"1h\",\n            \"limit\": 1,\n            \"startTime\": start_time_ms - 3600000,  # 1 hour before to get the correct candle\n            \"endTime\": start_time_ms\n        }\n\n        response = requests.get(api_url, params=params)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n\n        if data:\n            open_price = float(data[0][1])\n            close_price = float(data[0][4])\n            price_change_percentage = ((close_price - open_price) / open_price) * 100\n\n            if price_change_percentage >= 0:\n                return \"recommendation: p2\"  # Up\n            else:\n                return \"recommendation: p1\"  # Down\n        else:\n            return \"recommendation: p3\"  # Unknown/50-50 if no data\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Failed to fetch or process data: {e}\")\n        return \"recommendation: p3\"  # Default to unknown/50-50 on error\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to determine the price change of BTCUSDT on Binance for June 11, 2025, 1 AM ET.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = get_btc_price_change(\"2025-06-11\", 1, 0, \"US/Eastern\")\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p3\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful. Recommendation found: p3.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p3\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.14, ID: 61088126764283162826277723565641681191549727792822869363355919224445754948961, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.86, ID: 24710301609469089467262625283159380331605490472204448574591467851990435652108, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.860 = 86.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

I need you to generate code to solve the following prediction market question:\n\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Bitcoin Up or Down - June 11, 1 AM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for BTCUSDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTCUSDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTCUSDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 550874\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Bitcoin Up or Down - June 11, 1 AM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for BTCUSDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTCUSDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTCUSDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 550874\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749622083 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-11 06:08:03 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p3. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Configure logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nconsole_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\nconsole_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nconsole_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\nlogger.addHandler(console_handler)\n\ndef get_btcusdt_price_change(date_str, hour, minute, timezone_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches the percentage change for the BTCUSDT pair for the 1-hour candle starting at the specified time.\n\n    Args:\n        date_str: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format\n        hour: Hour in 24-hour format\n        minute: Minute\n        timezone_str: Timezone string\n\n    Returns:\n        Percentage change as float\n    \"\"\"\n    logger.info(f\"Fetching BTCUSDT price change for {date_str} at {hour}:{minute} {timezone_str}\")\n    \n    # Convert the target time to UTC timestamp\n    try:\n        tz = pytz.timezone(timezone_str)\n        time_str = f\"{hour:02d}:{minute:02d}:00\"\n        target_time_local = tz.localize(\n            datetime.strptime(f\"{date_str} {time_str}\", \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n        )\n        target_time_utc = target_time_local.astimezone(timezone.utc)\n        start_time_ms = int(target_time_utc.timestamp() * 1000)\n        \n        logger.debug(f\"Converted local time to UTC timestamp: {start_time_ms}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Error converting time: {e}\")\n        raise\n\n    # Binance API endpoint\n    api_url = \"https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines\"\n    params = {\n        \"symbol\": \"BTCUSDT\",\n        \"interval\": \"1h\",\n        \"limit\": 1,\n        \"startTime\": start_time_ms,\n        \"endTime\": start_time_ms + 3600000  # plus 1 hour\n    }\n\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(api_url, params=params)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n        \n        if data:\n            open_price = float(data[0][1])\n            close_price = float(data[0][4])\n            price_change_percent = ((close_price - open_price) / open_price) * 100\n            logger.info(f\"Successfully retrieved price change: {price_change_percent}%\")\n            return price_change_percent\n            \n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        logger.error(f\"API request failed: {e}\")\n        raise\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to determine if the BTCUSDT price went up or down.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Specific date and time for the query\n    date_str = \"2025-06-11\"\n    hour = 1  # 1 AM ET\n    minute = 0\n    timezone_str = \"US/Eastern\"\n\n    try:\n        price_change_percent = get_btcusdt_price_change(date_str, hour, minute, timezone_str)\n        \n        if price_change_percent >= 0:\n            print(\"recommendation: p2\")  # Up\n        else:\n            print(\"recommendation: p1\")  # Down\n        \n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Error processing query: {e}\")\n        print(\"recommendation: p3\")  # Unknown/50-50 due to error\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p3\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful. Recommendation found: p3.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p3\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.14, ID: 61088126764283162826277723565641681191549727792822869363355919224445754948961, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.86, ID: 24710301609469089467262625283159380331605490472204448574591467851990435652108, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.860 = 86.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market based on whether the BTCUSDT 1-hour candle starting at June 11, 1 AM ET (which would be 5 AM UTC since ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time) had a percentage change greater than or equal to 0. The resolution depends on Binance's data for that specific candle.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the exact time window for the 1-hour candle. Binance's candles are based on UTC, so 1 AM ET on June 11 converts to 5 AM UTC. The 1-hour candle would run from 5:00:00 to 5:59:59.999 UTC. The percentage change is calculated as (Close - Open)/Open * 100.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources provide historical data. For example, result [3] mentions a Kaggle dataset updated daily with Binance API data, including 1-hour candles. Result [23] also references a Kaggle dataset with BTCUSDT 1-hour data up to June 29, 2022, but the current date in the context is June 11, 2025, so that might not be relevant. However, result [12] from CoinMarketCap shows BTC to USDT rates up to June 11, 2025, with the rate at 109,550.00 USDT, indicating a -0.64% change from the previous day. But this is daily data, not hourly.\n\nResult [9] and [30] from coinalyze.net mention Bitcoin's price around $110k on June 10-11, 2025, with some volatility. However, these are news articles and might not provide exact candle data. Result [6] includes a Binance post from January 2025 with technical analysis, but that's too old.\n\nThe key here is to find the exact 1-hour candle data for June 11, 5 AM UTC. Since the current timestamp is June 11, 2025, 6:08 AM UTC, the candle in question (5-6 AM UTC) has already closed. The user specified using Binance's data, so I should look for the OHLCV values for that specific hour.\n\nResult [58] from Binance's API documentation explains how to retrieve klines (candlestick data) using the /api/v3/klines endpoint with the symbol, interval, startTime, and endTime parameters. The 1-hour candle for 5 AM UTC would have a startTime of 1749607200000 (June 11, 2025, 5:00:00 AM UTC in milliseconds) and endTime of 1749610800000 (6:00:00 AM UTC). \n\nAssuming the data is available, the percentage change would be (Close - Open)/Open. If the close is >= open, it resolves to Up (p2); otherwise, Down (p1). Since the current time is past 6 AM UTC, the candle's data should be finalized. \n\nHowever, none of the provided search results explicitly list the exact Open and Close for that hour. The closest is result [12], which shows the price on June 11 as 109,550.00 USDT, but that's the daily close. Without explicit hourly data in the provided context, I might have to infer based on available information. \n\nGiven the ancillary data specifies using Binance's displayed change for the 1H candle, and assuming the data is correctly reported, the resolution would depend on whether that specific candle's change was non-negative. Since the user's current time is after the candle's close, and if Binance's API or frontend shows the change for that hour as >=0, the answer is p2 (Up). If the change is negative, it's p1 (Down). \n\nBut without the exact Open and Close values from the provided context, I might need to default to the most probable outcome based on the conditions. However, the user instruction says if no verifiable info is available but the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. But since the event is in the past and the data should be available, perhaps the answer is p4 (cannot resolve). Wait, no\u2014the user instruction says if the event is in the past but no info, assume the most probable outcome. But in this case, the data should be available via Binance's API. However, the provided search results don't include the exact 1-hour candle data for that time. \n\nWait, result [12] from CoinMarketCap shows on June 11, the price is 109,550.00 USDT, down 0.64% from the previous day. But that's the 24h change, not the 1h change. The 1h candle at 5 AM UTC's change isn't directly provided. \n\nGiven the ambiguity in the provided data and the requirement to use only the given search results, and considering that the user's current time is after the event, but the specific 1h data isn't present in the context, I might have to conclude that there's insufficient data in the provided sources to verify the exact change. However, the user's personalization instructions say if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The conditions here are whether the change is >=0. If the ancillary data doesn't specify a direction, but given the market's nature, it's 50-50, but the user's ancillary data says p3 is 0.5 (unknown/50-50). However, the resolution conditions are p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: 50-50. But the user instruction says if the event date is in the past and no info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But without data, it's unclear. However, the user might expect that since the event has passed, the data should be available. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is p4 (cannot resolve), but the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But the current timestamp is June 11, 6:08 AM UTC, so the 5 AM candle is completed. If the data isn't in the provided context, but Binance's API would have it, but the search results don't include it, perhaps the answer is p4. However, the user's instruction says to use the provided search results. Since none of the search results explicitly have the 1h candle data for that exact time, but the event is in the past, the correct resolution would be p4. But wait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. But how to determine that? If the 1h candle's change isn't available, perhaps the market resolves to p3 (50-50), but the ancillary data maps p3 to 0.5, which is 'unknown/50-50'. However, the resolution conditions are p1: Down, p2: Up. The user's instruction says if no info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But without data, it's impossible to know. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" So in this case, the ancillary data's conditions are p1: Down (change <0), p2: Up (change >=0). If there's no data, but the event is in the past, we have to assume the most probable outcome. But what's the most probable? Without data, it's 50-50, but the user's ancillary data says p3 is 0.5, which is the unknown. However, the instruction says to resolve based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions. Since the conditions don't specify a default, but the market is about whether the change is >=0, and without data, perhaps it's safer to return p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is p2 (Up) if the close is >= open. Looking at the search results, on June 11, the price is around 109k. For example, result [30] mentions Bitcoin is up 2.6% after a retrace from a high of $110k. But that's on June 11 at 3:10 AM UTC, which is before the 5 AM candle. Result [9] from June 10, 13:30 UTC mentions Bitcoin climbing to $110k but settling around $109,450. However, these are not specific to the 5 AM UTC 1h candle. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit data in the provided context for the exact 1h candle, but the event being in the past, and the instruction to resolve based on the most probable outcome, I might have to default to p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without data, it's impossible to determine. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Since the user's current time is after the candle's close, and if Binance's API or frontend shows the change for that hour as >=0, the answer is p2 (Up). If the change is negative, it's p1 (Down). \n\nBut without the exact Open and Close values from the provided context, I might need to default to the most probable outcome based on the conditions. However, the user instruction says if no verifiable info is available but the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. But since the event is in the past and the data should be available, perhaps the answer is p4 (cannot resolve). Wait, no\u2014the user instruction says if the event is in the past but no info, assume the most probable outcome. But in this case, the data should be available via Binance's API. However, the provided search results don't include the exact 1-hour candle data for that time. \n\nWait, result [12] from CoinMarketCap shows on June 11, the price is 109,550.00 USDT, down 0.64% from the previous day. But that's the 24h change, not the 1h change. The 1h candle at 5 AM UTC's change isn't directly provided. \n\nGiven the ambiguity in the provided data and the requirement to use only the given search results, and considering that the user's current time is after the event, but the specific 1h data isn't present in the context, I might have to conclude that there's insufficient data in the provided sources to verify the exact change. However, the user's personalization instructions say if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The conditions here are whether the change is >=0. If the ancillary data doesn't specify a direction, but given the market's nature, it's 50-50, but the user's ancillary data says p3 is 0.5 (unknown/50-50). However, the resolution conditions are p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: 50-50. But the user instruction says if the event date is in the past and no info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But without data, it's unclear. However, the user might expect that since the event has passed, the data should be available. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is p4 (cannot resolve), but the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But the current timestamp is June 11, 6:08 AM UTC, so the 5 AM candle is completed. If the data isn't in the provided context, but Binance's API would have it, but the search results don't include it, perhaps the answer is p4. However, the user's instruction says to use the provided search results. Since none of the search results explicitly have the 1h candle data for that exact time, but the event is in the past, the correct resolution would be p4. But wait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. But how to determine that? If the 1h candle's change isn't available, perhaps the market resolves to p3 (50-50), but the ancillary data maps p3 to 0.5, which is 'unknown/50-50'. However, the resolution conditions are p1: Down, p2: Up. The user's instruction says if no info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But without data, it's impossible to know. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" So in this case, the ancillary data's conditions are p1: Down (change <0), p2: Up (change >=0). If there's no data, but the event is in the past, we have to assume the most probable outcome. But what's the most probable? Without data, it's 50-50, but the user's ancillary data says p3 is 0.5, which is the unknown. However, the instruction says to resolve based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions. Since the conditions don't specify a default, but the market is about whether the change is >=0, and without data, perhaps it's safer to return p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is p2 (Up) if the close is >= open. Looking at the search results, on June 11, the price is around 109k. For example, result [30] mentions Bitcoin is up 2.6% after a retrace from a high of $110k. But that's on June 11 at 3:10 AM UTC, which is before the 5 AM candle. Result [9] from June 10, 13:30 UTC mentions Bitcoin climbing to $110k but settling around $109,450. However, these are not specific to the 5 AM UTC 1h candle. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit data in the provided context for the exact 1h candle, but the event being in the past, and the instruction to resolve based on the most probable outcome, I might have to default to p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without data, it's impossible to determine. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.14, ID: 61088126764283162826277723565641681191549727792822869363355919224445754948961, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.86, ID: 24710301609469089467262625283159380331605490472204448574591467851990435652108, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to determine if the BTCUSDT 1-hour candle starting at June 11, 1 AM ET (Eastern Time) closed up or down based on Binance data. The resolution depends on the percentage change displayed for that specific candle.\n\nFirst, I need to convert 1 AM ET to UTC because Binance uses UTC for their timestamps. From the search results, Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) is UTC-4. So 1 AM EDT would be 5 AM UTC. The candle in question starts at 5 AM UTC on June 11, 2025, and lasts for 1 hour, ending at 6 AM UTC.\n\nNext, I need to check the Binance data for that specific time window. The user provided several sources, including Kaggle datasets and Binance API documentation. The Kaggle dataset [5] and [8] include historical BTCUSDT data up to June 2025. However, the current date in the query is June 11, 2025, and the data might not be available yet. The Binance API [3][29] allows fetching historical klines, but there's a limit on the time range (up to 7 days). Since the event is on the same day, real-time data would be needed, which isn't available in the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, [6] mentions the BTCUSDT futures contract price on June 11, 2025, but it's a futures price, not the spot price. [7] shows Bitcoin's historical data up to June 11, 2025, but the close price is listed as N/A, indicating missing data. [23] provides a BTC to USDT rate history, but the entry for June 11 shows a decrease of 0.64%, which might be after the candle's close. However, without the exact timestamp, this can't be confirmed.\n\nThe user's previous attempt returned p4, likely due to insufficient data. The ancillary data specifies using Binance's 1H candle change. Since the exact data for 5-6 AM UTC isn't present in the sources, I need to infer. The current timestamp is June 11, 2025, 6:08:03 UTC, just after the candle closed. If the close price is available now, but the search results don't include it, I might have to rely on the most recent data. [23] shows the rate on June 11 as 109,550 USDT, down 0.64% from the previous day, but this is a daily close, not the 1H candle. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit 1H data in the provided sources and the requirement to resolve based on Binance's data, and considering the market conditions where if the event date is in the past and no data is available, we assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data defines p2 (Up) if the change is \u22650. Since the daily close on June 11 is lower than the previous day, but the 1H candle could have been positive, without concrete data, it's uncertain. However, the user's instruction says if no data, assume the most probable outcome. If the price was fluctuating around that time, but the daily trend is down, the 1H candle might also be down. But without data, it's safer to return p4 (unknown). However, the user's additional instruction says to try again, perhaps implying data exists. Rechecking, [23]'s hourly data might not be in the search results. Since the user insists on Binance's data and the exact time isn't available, p4 is still correct. But maybe I missed something. Wait, [10] shows Binance's data up to April 2025, which is before June. [27] mentions Binance news up to June 11, but no price data. [11] has live price charts but no historical 1H data. Given all this, the answer remains p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749622083 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-11 06:08:03 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4.

Your task is to analyze the provided query and decide which AI solver is best suited to handle it.\n\nAvailable solvers: perplexity\n\nSolver descriptions:\n- perplexity: Uses the Perplexity AI search engine to find information online to answer general questions. Best for:\n  * Historical data and events\n  * General knowledge questions requiring context\n  * Questions needing interpretation of complex information\n  * Has knowledge cutoff and may not have very recent information\n\n- code_runner: Executes code to fetch real-time data from specific APIs. Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Currently available data sources based on API keys:\n    - MLB (Major League Baseball) data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Bitcoin Up or Down - June 11, 1 AM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for BTCUSDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTCUSDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTCUSDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 550874\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",
