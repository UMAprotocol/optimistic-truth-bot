      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Lee Jae-myung won Jeju Province in the 2025 South Korean Presidential election. The market resolution depends on the official results from the National Election Commission (NEC). \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided for any mention of Jeju Province's election results. Looking through the sources, several mention voter turnout and regional breakdowns. For example, source [3] and [24] mention Jeju's voter turnout as the lowest, but that's about participation, not the candidate's performance. \n\nSource [1] has a table showing demographic groups and regions, but it doesn't specify Jeju. Source [4] and [26] discuss exit polls and preliminary results but don't break down by province. \n\nWait, source [63] from the Chosun Ilbo mentions that Lee Jae-myung led in Gwangju, North Jeolla, and South Jeolla, but Kim Moon-soo led in Daegu, North Gyeongsang, Busan, Ulsan, Gangwon, and South Gyeongsang. Jeju isn't listed here. \n\nLooking further, source [52] in the MK.co.kr article states that Lee was well ahead in Chungcheong and the Seoul area, but again, no mention of Jeju. Source [56] from the Korea Herald discusses regional strategies but doesn't provide vote counts per province. \n\nSource [68] from the Korea Herald's voter turnout article mentions Jeju had the lowest turnout at 74.6%, but again, not the candidate results. \n\nWait, source [25] from the 2022 election results on Wikipedia shows that in 2022, Lee Jae-myung won Jeju Island, but that's the previous election. However, the current query is about 2025. \n\nLooking at the 2025 election sources, source [1] (Wikipedia) mentions Lee Jae-myung's victory but doesn't specify Jeju. Source [56] (Wikipedia again) in the exit polls section doesn't list Jeju's breakdown. \n\nSource [63] (Chosun Ilbo) provides some regional results as of a certain time, but Jeju isn't mentioned. Source [72] (MK.co.kr) also doesn't mention Jeju. \n\nSince none of the provided sources explicitly state the results for Jeju Province in the 2025 election, I need to infer based on historical trends and available data. In the 2022 election, Lee won Jeju, but the 2025 context might differ. However, without explicit data, it's risky to assume. \n\nThe user's ancillary data specifies that the resolution is based on NEC's official results. Since the search results don't include the NEC's official breakdown by province, and the current date is June 3, 2025, which is the election day, the official results might not be fully published yet in the provided sources. \n\nGiven the absence of explicit data on Jeju's results in the provided sources, and considering the user's instructions to resolve based on available information, I should check if any source mentions Jeju's outcome. \n\nWait, source [25] (2022 election) shows Lee won Jeju, but source [56] (2025) mentions that in the exit polls, Lee was leading in traditional liberal strongholds. Jeju, however, has been a swing region in some elections. \n\nBut without explicit 2025 data, I can't confirm. The user's personalization rules state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. Since the election occurred on June 3, 2025, and the current timestamp is June 3, 2025, 23:56:08 UTC, the results might still be coming in. However, some sources like [37] and [50] mention Lee's victory nationally, but not regionally. \n\nGiven the lack of specific data on Jeju in the provided sources, and the requirement to resolve based on NEC's official results, which aren't present here, the safest recommendation is p4 (cannot be resolved now). However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past (which it is, same day but after the event), and if no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects that since Lee won nationally, he might have taken Jeju, but historically, Jeju can be a swing area. Without data, it's uncertain. However, in the 2022 election, Lee won Jeju, so maybe 2025 is similar. But the provided sources don't confirm this. \n\nWait, source [63] (Chosun Ilbo) mentions that as of 11:38 PM, Lee was leading in Seoul, Gwangju, North and South Jeolla, but Kim was leading in Daegu, North Gyeongsang, Busan, Ulsan, Gangwon, and South Gyeongsang. Jeju isn't listed here, but in the 2022 election, Lee won Jeju. If Jeju followed similar patterns, maybe Lee won again. However, without explicit data, it's speculative. \n\nGiven the instructions, if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. If Jeju is a liberal stronghold, maybe Lee won. But the sources don't confirm. Since the user's query requires a definitive answer based on NEC data, and the provided sources don't include that, the correct recommendation is p4 (cannot resolve now).

So Jeju was a toss-up. \n\nSource [22] states: \"In Gangwon and Jeju, candidate Kim Moon-soo is competing with candidate Lee Jae-myung within the margin of error.\" So in May, Jeju was a close race. \n\nIf the actual election followed this, and without final results in the sources, it's unclear.

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1748994968 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-03 23:56:08 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Lee Jae-myung won Jeju Province in the 2025 South Korean Presidential election. The market resolution depends on the official results from the National Election Commission (NEC). \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided for any mention of Jeju Province's election results. Looking through the sources, several mention voter turnout and regional breakdowns. For example, source [3] and [24] mention Jeju's voter turnout as the lowest, but that's about participation, not the candidate's performance. \n\nSource [1] has a table showing demographic groups and regions, but it doesn't specify Jeju. Source [4] and [26] discuss exit polls and preliminary results but don't break down by province. \n\nWait, source [63] from the Chosun Ilbo mentions that Lee Jae-myung led in Gwangju, North Jeolla, and South Jeolla, but Kim Moon-soo led in Daegu, North Gyeongsang, Busan, Ulsan, Gangwon, and South Gyeongsang. Jeju isn't listed here. \n\nLooking further, source [52] in the MK.co.kr article states that Lee was well ahead in Chungcheong and the Seoul area, but again, no mention of Jeju. Source [56] from the Korea Herald discusses regional strategies but doesn't provide vote counts per province. \n\nSource [68] from the Korea Herald's voter turnout article mentions Jeju had the lowest turnout at 74.6%, but again, not the candidate results. \n\nWait, source [25] from the 2022 election results on Wikipedia shows that in 2022, Lee Jae-myung won Jeju Island, but that's the previous election. However, the current query is about 2025. \n\nLooking at the 2025 election sources, source [1] (Wikipedia) mentions Lee Jae-myung's victory but doesn't specify Jeju. Source [56] (Wikipedia again) in the exit polls section doesn't list Jeju's breakdown. \n\nSource [63] (Chosun Ilbo) provides some regional results as of a certain time, but Jeju isn't mentioned. Source [72] (MK.co.kr) also doesn't mention Jeju. \n\nSince none of the provided sources explicitly state the results for Jeju Province in the 2025 election, I need to infer based on historical trends and available data. In the 2022 election, Lee won Jeju, but the 2025 context might differ. However, without explicit data, it's risky to assume. \n\nThe user's ancillary data specifies that the resolution is based on NEC's official results. Since the search results don't include the NEC's official breakdown by province, and the current date is June 3, 2025, which is the election day, the official results might not be fully published yet in the provided sources. \n\nGiven the absence of explicit data on Jeju's results in the provided sources, and considering the user's instructions to resolve based on available information, I should check if any source mentions Jeju's outcome. \n\nWait, source [25] (2022 election) shows Lee won Jeju, but source [56] (2025) mentions that in the exit polls, Lee was leading in traditional liberal strongholds. Jeju, however, has been a swing region in some elections. \n\nBut without explicit 2025 data, I can't confirm. The user's personalization rules state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. Since the election occurred on June 3, 2025, and the current timestamp is June 3, 2025, 23:56:08 UTC, the results might still be coming in. However, some sources like [37] and [50] mention Lee's victory nationally, but not regionally. \n\nGiven the lack of specific data on Jeju in the provided sources, and the requirement to resolve based on NEC's official results, which aren't present here, the safest recommendation is p4 (cannot be resolved now). However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past (which it is, same day but after the event), and if no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects that since Lee won nationally, he might have taken Jeju, but historically, Jeju can be a swing area. Without data, it's uncertain. However, in the 2022 election, Lee won Jeju, so maybe 2025 is similar. But the provided sources don't confirm this. \n\nWait, source [63] (Chosun Ilbo) mentions that as of 11:38 PM, Lee was leading in Seoul, Gwangju, North and South Jeolla, but Kim was leading in Daegu, North Gyeongsang, Busan, Ulsan, Gangwon, and South Gyeongsang. Jeju isn't listed here, but in the 2022 election, Lee won Jeju. If Jeju followed similar patterns, maybe Lee won again. However, without explicit data, it's speculative. \n\nGiven the instructions, if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. If Jeju is a liberal stronghold, maybe Lee won. But the sources don't confirm. Since the user's query requires a definitive answer based on NEC data, and the provided sources don't include that, the correct recommendation is p4 (cannot resolve now). However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nBut the current timestamp is June 3, 2025, 23:56:08 UTC, which is after the election. The NEC would have started counting, but maybe the official results for Jeju aren't out yet in the provided sources. \n\nLooking at source [37], CBS News reports Lee's victory nationally but doesn't mention Jeju. Source [50] (CBS again) same. Source [52] (CSIS analysis) mentions Lee's national win but no regional breakdown. \n\nSince the user's query is specifically about Jeju Province, and the provided search results don't include the NEC's official results for Jeju, the resolution can't be definitively determined from the given sources. Therefore, the recommendation should be p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nBut how to determine the most probable? In 2022, Lee won Jeju. If the 2025 election followed similar regional trends, perhaps Lee won again. However, without explicit data, this is an assumption.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1748994968 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-03 23:56:08 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Lee Jae-myung won Jeju Province in the 2025 Korean Presidential election. The market resolution depends on whether he received the highest votes there. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. Let's look through each source. \n\nSearch result [1] talks about the 2022 election, where Lee Jae-myung was the Democratic candidate but lost to Yoon. Not directly relevant, but maybe background. \n\nResult [2] is from CBS News, dated 2025-06-03, stating Lee Jae-myung won the snap election. It mentions high turnout but doesn't specify Jeju. \n\nResult [3] from Korea JoongAng Daily on 2025-06-04 confirms Lee's election, noting he received 49.42% nationwide. Still no Jeju details. \n\nResult [5] from Korea Herald in 2022 discusses Jeju's voting trends, mentioning that in the 2022 election, Lee won Jeju with 52.6% vs. Yoon's 42.7%. This shows Jeju has been favorable to Democrats. \n\nResult [14] (in Korean) from Daum.net reports Jeju's voter turnout at 74.6%, the lowest nationally. \n\nResult [15] (also Korean) from Daum.net gives detailed Jeju results: Lee Jae-myung got 54.76%, Kim Moon-soo 34.78%, others trailing. This is crucial\u2014it directly answers the query. \n\nResult [16] from Korean Wikipedia lists the final results, including Jeju where Lee won 54.76%. \n\nResult [18] from Chosun.com mentions Lee won Jeju with 54.76%, confirming again. \n\nPutting this together, multiple sources ([15], [16], [18]) confirm Lee won Jeju with over 50% of the vote. The NEC official results would be the primary source, but since the provided search results include NEC's data through these sources, it's safe to conclude Lee did win Jeju. \n\nThe user's ancillary data defines p2 as \"Yes\" if Lee has the highest votes in Jeju. All evidence points to that. Therefore, the recommendation should be p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.983, ID: 35661768650780380512438511243704183323807366489730094211285602450736271485955, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.017, ID: 39878667141524712015854491446439825559781557902729203141627037026902032837358, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.983 = 98.3% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
