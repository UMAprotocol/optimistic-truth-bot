The user wants to know if any DeepSeek model has a higher arena score than all OpenAI models on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard by May 31, 2025. The resolution depends on the data from the provided search results.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current leaderboard standings. Looking at the search results, especially [1], [6], [9], [28], [36], and [51], the WebDev Arena Leaderboard lists models with their Arena Scores. \n\nFrom these sources, the top OpenAI models listed are GPT-4.1-2025-04-14 with an Arena Score of 1399[1][6][9][28][36][51], and GPT-4o-2024-11-20 with a score of 964[1][6][9][28][36][51]. \n\nDeepSeek models mentioned include DeepSeek-V3 with a score of 959.80[1][6][9][28][36][51] and DeepSeek-R1 at 1198.63[9]. However, DeepSeek-R1's score of 1198.63 is lower than OpenAI's GPT-4.1-2025-04-14's 1399. \n\nAnother DeepSeek model, DeepSeek-V3-0324, has a score of 1206.73[9], which is still below GPT-4.1's 1399. \n\nAdditionally, in the Text Arena leaderboard[2][10][25][33][49][72], the top OpenAI model is o3-2025-04-16 with a score of 1442, while DeepSeek's models like DeepSeek-V3-0324 have lower scores. \n\nSince none of the DeepSeek models' scores exceed the highest OpenAI models' scores in the provided data, the answer should be \"No\". The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Yes\" only if a DeepSeek model's score is higher, not tied. The current data shows DeepSeek models trailing behind OpenAI's top entries.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\n**Explanation:**  \nBased on the provided search results, DeepSeek's **DeepSeek-R1** model achieves an Arena Score of **1198.63** [9], while OpenAI's **GPT-4.1-2025-04-14** scores **1399** [1][6][9]. Since **1198.63 < 1399**, DeepSeek models do not surpass OpenAI's top models. However, the **DeepSeek-V3-0324** model scores **1206.73** [9], still below OpenAI's leading scores. No DeepSeek model exceeds all OpenAI models' Arena Scores in the data.  \n\n**Final Resolution:**  \n**No** (p1) \u2013 DeepSeek models do not achieve higher Arena Scores than all OpenAI models by the specified deadline.",

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749060618 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-04 18:10:18 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if any DeepSeek model has a higher arena score than all OpenAI models on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard by May 31, 2025. The resolution depends on the data from the provided search results.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current leaderboard standings. Looking at the search results, especially [1], [6], [9], [28], [36], and [51], the WebDev Arena Leaderboard lists models with their Arena Scores. \n\nFrom these sources, the top OpenAI models listed are GPT-4.1-2025-04-14 with an Arena Score of 1399[1][6][9][28][36][51], and GPT-4o-2024-11-20 with a score of 964[1][6][9][28][36][51]. \n\nDeepSeek models mentioned include DeepSeek-V3 with a score of 959.80[1][6][9][28][36][51] and DeepSeek-R1 at 1198.63[9]. However, DeepSeek-R1's score of 1198.63 is lower than OpenAI's GPT-4.1-2025-04-14's 1399. \n\nAnother DeepSeek model, DeepSeek-V3-0324, has a score of 1206.73[9], which is still below GPT-4.1's 1399. \n\nAdditionally, in the Text Arena leaderboard[2][10][25][33][49][72], the top OpenAI model is o3-2025-04-16 with a score of 1442, while DeepSeek's models like DeepSeek-V3-0324 have lower scores. \n\nSince none of the DeepSeek models' scores exceed the highest OpenAI models' scores in the provided data, the answer should be \"No\". The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Yes\" only if a DeepSeek model's score is higher, not tied. The current data shows DeepSeek models trailing behind OpenAI's top entries.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\n**Explanation:**  \nBased on the provided search results, DeepSeek's **DeepSeek-R1** model achieves an Arena Score of **1198.63** [9], while OpenAI's **GPT-4.1-2025-04-14** scores **1399** [1][6][9]. Since **1198.63 < 1399**, DeepSeek models do not surpass OpenAI's top models. However, the **DeepSeek-V3-0324** model scores **1206.73** [9], still below OpenAI's leading scores. No DeepSeek model exceeds all OpenAI models' Arena Scores in the data.  \n\n**Final Resolution:**  \n**No** (p1) \u2013 DeepSeek models do not achieve higher Arena Scores than all OpenAI models by the specified deadline.\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0, ID: 7282240974654800303328577762157796988229054792029789559538121611027503919109, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 1, ID: 4039323209168556884503531306717836843072332486199546835894242702181296524640, Winner: Yes\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The user wants to know if any DeepSeek model has a higher arena score than all OpenAI models on the Chatbot Arena LLM Leaderboard by May 31, 2025. The resolution depends on the leaderboard data up until that date.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for the latest leaderboard standings. Looking at the search results, there are several mentions of the leaderboard. For example, in [1], the text arena leaderboard as of 2 days ago shows OpenAI models like GPT-4o-latest-20250326 with a score of 1429 and GPT-4.5-preview-2025-02-27 at 1424. The DeepSeek models mentioned in [4], [5], and [16] include DeepSeek V3 and R1. However, in the WebDev Arena from [2] and [3], DeepSeek's models like Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct have a score of 902.28, which is lower than OpenAI's GPT-4.1-2025-04-14 at 959.80. \n\nWait, but the user is asking about the main Chatbot Arena, not the WebDev one. The main leaderboard in [1] lists OpenAI models with scores up to 1429, while DeepSeek models aren't in the top ranks there. However, in [9], the Copilot Arena from November 2024 shows DeepSeek V2.5 with a score of 1074, higher than some OpenAI models like GPT-4o-mini. But the key is whether any DeepSeek model surpassed all OpenAI models by May 31, 2025.\n\nLooking at [8], from August 2024, OpenAI's ChatGPT-4o (20240808) had a score of 1314, which was higher than Gemini. But that's before 2025. In [14], as of April 2025, DeepSeek-V3 and R1 were ranked 4th and 5th overall, but the top spots were held by models like Gemini and Claude. The latest data in [1] from June 2025 shows OpenAI's models still leading with scores like 1429, while DeepSeek's highest in the text arena isn't listed in the top. \n\nThe critical point is whether any DeepSeek model's arena score exceeded all OpenAI models by the deadline. The search results don't show any instance where a DeepSeek model's score is higher than the top OpenAI models listed. For example, in [1], the top OpenAI model has 1429, and the highest DeepSeek in WebDev is 902.28, which is much lower. Even in Copilot Arena [9], DeepSeek V2.5's 1074 is below GPT-4o's 1016, but that's a different arena. \n\nSince the resolution source is the main Chatbot Arena at lmarena.ai, and the provided data up to June 2025 doesn't show DeepSeek surpassing OpenAI's top scores, the answer should be \"No\". However, the user's previous response was p2 (Yes), and they want a different approach. Maybe I missed a source. Checking again, [16] mentions DeepSeek-V3 as the best open-source model but doesn't compare directly to OpenAI's scores. [17] says DeepSeek-R1 was ranked #3 overall, but the top models were still from other companies. \n\nTherefore, based on the available data, no DeepSeek model has a higher score than all OpenAI models by the deadline.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
