The event date is June 7, 2025, at 11:00 AM ET. The current timestamp is June 7, 2025, 3:51 PM UTC, which is after the scheduled match time. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the match has occurred and if there's any verifiable result. The search results include multiple sources like HLTV, Dust2.us, and egamersworld. From the search results, especially [1], [11], [18], [25], [35], and [45], the match was scheduled for June 7, 2025, 11:00 AM. However, none of the provided search results explicitly state the outcome of the match. Some sources mention the teams' lineups, rankings, and past performances but don't report the result.\n\nThe user specified that if no verifiable information is available and the event date is in the past, we should assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. Falcons are ranked #4, while B8 is #23. Falcons have a higher win rate (61.3% vs. B8's 75%), but B8 has an 8-match win streak. However, Falcons are the favorites according to bookmakers, as seen in [16], [32], [44], [55], and [56]. \n\nSince there's no explicit result in the sources, and the event date has passed, the resolution should default to the most probable outcome, which is Falcons winning. Therefore, the recommendation is p2 (Falcons).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Where p1 corresponds to B8, p2 to Falcons, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749311501 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-07 15:51:41 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Falcons vs. B8 match in the BLAST.tv Austin Major Stage 2. The event date is June 7, 2025, at 11:00 AM ET. The current timestamp is June 7, 2025, 3:51 PM UTC, which is after the scheduled match time. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the match has occurred and if there's any verifiable result. The search results include multiple sources like HLTV, Dust2.us, and egamersworld. From the search results, especially [1], [11], [18], [25], [35], and [45], the match was scheduled for June 7, 2025, 11:00 AM. However, none of the provided search results explicitly state the outcome of the match. Some sources mention the teams' lineups, rankings, and past performances but don't report the result.\n\nThe user specified that if no verifiable information is available and the event date is in the past, we should assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. Falcons are ranked #4, while B8 is #23. Falcons have a higher win rate (61.3% vs. B8's 75%), but B8 has an 8-match win streak. However, Falcons are the favorites according to bookmakers, as seen in [16], [32], [44], [55], and [56]. \n\nSince there's no explicit result in the sources, and the event date has passed, the resolution should default to the most probable outcome, which is Falcons winning. Therefore, the recommendation is p2 (Falcons).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Falcons, Price: 0.25, ID: 20682285330895336208406580547934865979742107859611357300679701655650970100203, Winner: No\n- Token: B8, Price: 0.75, ID: 28347731819891976109446098229890370142996397670680987148116369902898856339993, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to B8, p2 to Falcons, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = B8, p2 = Falcons\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors B8 outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.750 = 75.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of a Counter-Strike match between Falcons and B8 in the BLAST.tv Austin Major Stage 2. The event date is June 7, 2025, at 11:00 AM ET, and the resolution depends on who wins that specific match. The sources provided include various HLTV pages, Liquipedia, and other esports sites.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm whether the match happened as scheduled. The current date given is June 7, 2025, 3:55 PM UTC. The match was supposed to be at 11:00 AM ET, which is 15:00 UTC. Since the current time is 15:51 UTC, the match should have already taken place. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's a mix of information. Some sources like [3], [12], and [14] mention the match between Falcons and B8 on June 7. Specifically, [14] from Sofascore shows the match as finished with a score of 0-1 in favor of B8. However, other sources like [11] list the match as upcoming but don't provide the result yet. \n\nI need to cross-verify these. The HLTV match page in [2] is the official source per the resolution conditions. However, the provided search results don't include the actual HLTV match page result. The closest is [14], which is a third-party site, and [3], which is a preview. The user's personalization instructions say to rely on the provided URLs and updates. Since [14] indicates B8 won, but it's a third-party site, I need to check if there's any conflicting information.\n\nAnother point is the ancillary data: p2 corresponds to Falcons winning, but the user's previous response was p2, and they want a different approach. Wait, the personalization says the previous response was p2, but the user wants to check again. If the match result in [14] is B8 winning, then the correct resolution should be p1. However, I need to ensure that the source is reliable. The resolution source should be HLTV, but the provided search results don't have the HLTV match result. The HLTV coverage hub [1] doesn't list the specific match result yet. \n\nThere's a conflict here. The third-party sites like [14] say B8 won, but without official HLTV confirmation in the provided sources, it's risky. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. The bookmakers in [3] heavily favored Falcons, but if the match happened and B8 won, that's the result. \n\nGiven that the current timestamp is past the match time, and [14] shows B8 won, even though it's a third-party site, under the user's instructions, if the event is in the past and no official source is provided, but there's a third-party indication, we might have to go with that. However, the resolution source is supposed to be HLTV. Since the provided search results don't include the HLTV match page result, but [14] and [12] suggest B8 won, perhaps the correct resolution is p1. But the user's previous response was p2, so maybe they missed this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the match hasn't been updated yet in the sources. But given the current time is after the match, and some sources show it as finished, the most probable outcome based on the conditions would be B8 winning, hence p1. However, the user's personalization says if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The conditions in the query say if the match is canceled or delayed beyond June 28, resolve to 50-50. Since it's June 7, and the match was played, the result should stand. \n\nTherefore, considering the third-party sources indicating B8 won, despite the official HLTV source not being present in the provided search results, the recommendation should be p1. But the user's previous response was p2, so maybe they need to check again. However, according to the provided data, the correct answer is p1 based on [14] and [3] (which mentions the match is on June 7 and B8's recent performance). \n\nWait, [3] is a preview from June 6, predicting Falcons to win. [14] is from June 7, showing B8 won 0-1. So if [14] is accurate, then the resolution is p1. However, the user's instructions say to use the provided URLs. Since [14] is a provided URL and shows the result, even though it's not HLTV, under the user's personalization, if the user specifies the resolution source as HLTV but the provided sources include third-party sites with the result, and the event date is in the past, we should go with the available info. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation should be p1 (B8 wins), but the user's previous response was p2. However, the user wants a different approach. Maybe the initial response didn't consider [14]. So the correct answer is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749311501 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-07 15:51:41 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p2.
