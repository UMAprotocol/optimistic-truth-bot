Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750281424 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-18 21:17:04 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Configure logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nconsole_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\nconsole_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nconsole_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\nlogger.addHandler(console_handler)\n\ndef get_eth_price_at_specific_time(date_str, hour=16, minute=0, timezone_str=\"US/Eastern\"):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches the 1-hour candle open and close price for ETH/USDT on Binance\n    at a specific time on a given date.\n\n    Args:\n        date_str: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format\n        hour: Hour in 24-hour format (default: 16)\n        minute: Minute (default: 0)\n        timezone_str: Timezone string (default: \"US/Eastern\")\n\n    Returns:\n        Tuple of (open price, close price)\n    \"\"\"\n    logger.info(f\"Fetching ETH/USDT price for {date_str} at {hour}:{minute} {timezone_str}\")\n    \n    # Convert the target time to UTC timestamp\n    try:\n        tz = pytz.timezone(timezone_str)\n        time_str = f\"{hour:02d}:{minute:02d}:00\"\n        target_time_local = tz.localize(\n            datetime.strptime(f\"{date_str} {time_str}\", \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n        )\n        target_time_utc = target_time_local.astimezone(timezone.utc)\n        start_time_ms = int(target_time_utc.timestamp() * 1000)\n        \n        logger.debug(f\"Converted local time to UTC timestamp: {start_time_ms}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Error converting time: {e}\")\n        raise\n\n    # Binance API endpoint\n    api_url = \"https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines\"\n    params = {\n        \"symbol\": \"ETHUSDT\",\n        \"interval\": \"1h\",\n        \"limit\": 1,\n        \"startTime\": start_time_ms,\n        \"endTime\": start_time_ms + 3600000  # plus 1 hour\n    }\n\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(api_url, params=params)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n        \n        if data:\n            open_price = float(data[0][1])\n            close_price = float(data[0][4])\n            logger.info(f\"Successfully retrieved open price: {open_price} and close price: {close_price}\")\n            return (open_price, close_price)\n        else:\n            logger.error(\"No data returned from Binance API\")\n            raise Exception(\"No data available\")\n            \n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        logger.error(f\"API request failed: {e}\")\n        raise\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to handle the Ethereum price query for June 18, 2025, 4 PM ET.\n    \"\"\"\n    date_str = \"2025-06-18\"\n    hour = 16  # 4 PM ET\n    minute = 0\n    timezone_str = \"US/Eastern\"\n\n    try:\n        open_price, close_price = get_eth_price_at_specific_time(date_str, hour, minute, timezone_str)\n        \n        if close_price >= open_price:\n            recommendation = \"p2\"  # Up\n        else:\n            recommendation = \"p1\"  # Down\n        \n        print(f\"recommendation: {recommendation}\")\n        \n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Error processing query: {e}\")\n        print(\"recommendation: p3\")  # Unknown/50-50 if error occurs\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p3\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful. Recommendation found: p3.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p3\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.9995, ID: 48479872343854689169771192590083999748077197418359193574469953675523105913084, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.0005, ID: 28909463463001895749532932950192492175928173075125566965941643437306885077398, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750281424 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-18 21:17:04 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please ensure the code execution correctly fetches and processes the data without errors, and aligns the recommendation with the strong market sentiment favoring 'Up'.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Configure logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nconsole_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\nconsole_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nconsole_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\nlogger.addHandler(console_handler)\n\ndef get_eth_price(date_str, hour=16, minute=0, timezone_str=\"US/Eastern\"):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches the ETH/USDT 1-hour candle data from Binance at a specific time on a given date.\n\n    Args:\n        date_str: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format\n        hour: Hour in 24-hour format (default: 16 for 4 PM ET)\n        minute: Minute (default: 0)\n        timezone_str: Timezone string (default: \"US/Eastern\")\n\n    Returns:\n        Tuple of (open_price, close_price)\n    \"\"\"\n    logger.info(f\"Fetching ETH/USDT price for {date_str} at {hour}:{minute} {timezone_str}\")\n    \n    # Convert the target time to UTC timestamp\n    tz = pytz.timezone(timezone_str)\n    time_str = f\"{hour:02d}:{minute:02d}:00\"\n    target_time_local = tz.localize(\n        datetime.strptime(f\"{date_str} {time_str}\", \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n    )\n    target_time_utc = target_time_local.astimezone(timezone.utc)\n    start_time_ms = int(target_time_utc.timestamp() * 1000) - 3600000  # 1 hour in milliseconds\n\n    # Binance API endpoint\n    api_url = \"https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines\"\n    params = {\n        \"symbol\": \"ETHUSDT\",\n        \"interval\": \"1h\",\n        \"limit\": 1,\n        \"startTime\": start_time_ms,\n        \"endTime\": start_time_ms + 3600000  # 1 hour later\n    }\n\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(api_url, params=params)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n        \n        if data:\n            open_price = float(data[0][1])\n            close_price = float(data[0][4])\n            logger.info(f\"Successfully retrieved open price: {open_price} and close price: {close_price}\")\n            return (open_price, close_price)\n        else:\n            logger.error(\"No data returned from Binance API\")\n            return None\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        logger.error(f\"API request failed: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to determine if the ETH price went up or down on June 18, 2025 at 4 PM ET.\n    \"\"\"\n    date_str = \"2025-06-18\"\n    hour = 16  # 4 PM ET\n    minute = 0\n    timezone_str = \"US/Eastern\"\n\n    try:\n        prices = get_eth_price(date_str, hour, minute, timezone_str)\n        if prices:\n            open_price, close_price = prices\n            if close_price >= open_price:\n                print(\"recommendation: p2\")  # Up\n            else:\n                print(\"recommendation: p1\")  # Down\n        else:\n            print(\"recommendation: p3\")  # Unknown/50-50 if no data\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Error during price retrieval or processing: {e}\")\n        print(\"recommendation: p3\")  # Unknown/50-50 on error\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p3\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful. Recommendation found: p3.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p3\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.9995, ID: 48479872343854689169771192590083999748077197418359193574469953675523105913084, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.0005, ID: 28909463463001895749532932950192492175928173075125566965941643437306885077398, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on whether the ETH/USDT 1-hour candle on June 18, 4 PM ET closed up or down. The resolution depends on Binance's data for that specific candle.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the exact time window. The candle starts at June 18, 4 PM ET. Since Binance uses UTC, I should convert 4 PM ET to UTC. ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, so 4 PM ET is 8 PM UTC. The 1-hour candle from 8 PM to 9 PM UTC on June 18, 2025.\n\nNext, check the search results for ETH/USDT data around that time. The current timestamp given is June 18, 2025, 21:17:04 UTC. The user's query is from June 18, so the candle in question (8-9 PM UTC) would have already occurred. \n\nLooking at the search results, result 35 from CoinMarketCap shows ETH/USDT closing prices. On June 18, the close is listed as N/A, but June 17's close is $2,514.99. However, this might not be the specific hour needed. \n\nResult 33 from TradingView news mentions ETH's price on June 18 at $2,496, but it's unclear if this is the exact candle close. Result 38 from Blockchain.News states that as of 10:00 AM UTC on June 18, ETH was trading around $3,450, but this is earlier in the day. \n\nResult 35 (CoinMarketCap) has a table with June 18's close as N/A, which is confusing. Maybe the data wasn't updated yet. However, result 35 also shows a conversion rate of 2,524.86 USDT as of the current time (9:52 AM UTC on June 18). Wait, the current timestamp in the problem is June 18, 2025, 21:17:04 UTC, which is 9:17 PM UTC. The candle in question is from 8-9 PM UTC, so the close would be at 9 PM UTC. Since the current time in the query is 9:17 PM UTC, the candle should have closed, and data should be available.\n\nLooking at result 35 again, the ETH to USDT rate on June 18 is listed as 2,524.86 USDT. However, the exact open and close for the 8-9 PM UTC candle isn't directly provided. The search results don't have a specific entry for that exact hour. \n\nResult 33 (TradingView news) from June 18 mentions ETH's price at $2,496, but the time isn't specified. Result 38 (Blockchain.News) from June 18 at 10:00 AM UTC mentions ETH at $3,450, but that's earlier. \n\nWait, the user provided search results up to result 56. Let me check again. Result 35 is from CoinMarketCap, showing the ETH/USDT rate on June 18 as 2,524.86. The current time in the query is 9:17 PM UTC, so the 8-9 PM candle would have closed at 9 PM UTC. If the close price is higher than the open, it resolves to Up. \n\nBut without explicit open and close values for that specific hour, I need to infer from available data. If the price at 9 PM UTC is higher than at 8 PM, then it's Up. However, the search results don't have the exact hourly data. \n\nWait, result 33 (TradingView) from June 18 says ETH was at $2,496 at press time, but the article's date is June 18, 2025, 10:36 GMT-7, which is 5:36 PM UTC. That's before the 8 PM UTC candle. \n\nResult 35's data shows the ETH/USDT rate on June 18 as 2,524.86, but this might be the current price at 9:52 AM UTC, not the specific candle. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit data for the 8-9 PM UTC candle, but knowing the current timestamp is after 9 PM UTC, I should check if any sources mention the close price. Result 35's table shows June 18's close as N/A, which might indicate missing data. However, the user's personalization instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if no verifiable info is available, but the event date is in the past. \n\nWait, the current timestamp is June 18, 9:17 PM UTC, so the candle from 8-9 PM UTC has closed. The resolution source is Binance's ETH/USDT 1H candle. If the close is >= open, it's Up (p2). Otherwise, Down (p1). \n\nSince the search results don't explicitly state the open and close for that hour, but the user instructions say to use the provided search results, I need to look for any clues. Result 35's ETH/USDT rate on June 18 is 2,524.86, but that's the current price at 9:52 AM UTC, not the specific candle. \n\nAlternatively, result 38 mentions BlackRock buying ETH, causing a price increase. If the price was rising, maybe the close was higher. But this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, result 33 mentions ETH's price at $2,496, but the time isn't clear. If that's the close of the 8-9 PM candle, but the open was lower, then it's Up. However, without exact data, it's uncertain. \n\nThe user instructions state that if no verifiable information is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. However, the event date is in the past (June 18, 4 PM ET), so we must resolve based on available data. \n\nSince the search results don't provide the exact open and close for the 8-9 PM UTC candle, but the current timestamp is after the event, and assuming Binance's data is accurate, the resolution would depend on whether the close was >= open. \n\nBut without explicit data, perhaps the answer is p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But how to determine that? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the close price is available in the search results. Let me check again. Result 35's table shows June 18's close as N/A, but the current price is 2,524.86. If the candle closed at 9 PM UTC, and the price at that time was higher than the open, then it's Up. \n\nAlternatively, looking at result 35's conversion table, the current rate is 2,524.86 as of 09:52:08 AM on June 18. That's before the 8 PM UTC candle. So not helpful. \n\nResult 40 mentions Bybit's campaign affecting trading volume, but not specific prices. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit data, but the instructions to resolve based on Binance's data, and if no data is available, assume the most probable outcome. However, without knowing the open and close, it's impossible to determine. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nThe current timestamp is June 18, 2025, 21:17:04 UTC. The event (8-9 PM UTC candle) is in the past. If no data is found, we have to assume the most probable outcome. The user prompt's ancillary data says p1 is Down, p2 is Up. \n\nBut how to determine the most probable? If the overall trend on June 18 is down, then Down. Looking at result 35, June 18's price is down 1.71% in 24 hours. But that's the 24h change, not the specific hour. \n\nAlternatively, result 33 mentions ETH's price at $2,496, down 2.18% on June 18. If the overall day is down, maybe the specific hour also closed down. But this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, result 38 mentions ETH trading at $3,450 at 10 AM UTC, which is much higher, but that's earlier. If the price dropped later, the 8-9 PM candle might have closed lower. \n\nWithout explicit data, it's challenging. However, the instructions say to use the provided search results. Since none of the search results explicitly state the open and close for the 8-9 PM UTC candle, and the event is in the past, the resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nBut how to determine that? Maybe the market resolves to Down if the overall trend is down. However, without concrete data, it's a guess. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is p4 because the data isn't available in the provided sources. But the user instructions say to use the provided search results. If the data isn't there, then p4. \n\nBut the user's personalization also says: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\" The resolution source is Binance's ETH/USDT pair, specifically the 1H candle. The provided search results include Binance's price page (result 1), but it's for Aave Ethereum USDT, not ETH/USDT. Other results mention ETH/USDT but not the specific candle. \n\nGiven that, and no explicit data in the search results for the specific candle, the resolution would be p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without data, it's impossible. \n\nWait, the current timestamp is after the event, so the data should be available. Maybe the answer is p2 (Up) if the close is higher, but without data, it's unclear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is p4 because the necessary data isn't present in the search results. But the user's instructions say to use the provided search results. If the data isn't there, then p4. \n\nBut the user's personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nThe conditions in the user prompt are that the market resolves to Up if close >= open. Without data, but the event is in the past, perhaps the default is to assume it's Up. But this is a stretch. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is p4 because the data isn't available in the provided sources. However, the user's instructions emphasize using the provided search results.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750281424 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-18 21:17:04 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on whether the ETH/USDT 1-hour candle on June 18, 4 PM ET closed up or down. The resolution depends on Binance's data for that specific candle.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the exact time window. The candle starts at June 18, 4 PM ET. Since Binance uses UTC, I should convert 4 PM ET to UTC. ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, so 4 PM ET is 8 PM UTC. The 1-hour candle from 8 PM to 9 PM UTC on June 18, 2025.\n\nNext, check the search results for ETH/USDT data around that time. The current timestamp given is June 18, 2025, 21:17:04 UTC. The user's query is from June 18, so the candle in question (8-9 PM UTC) would have already occurred. \n\nLooking at the search results, result 35 from CoinMarketCap shows ETH/USDT closing prices. On June 18, the close is listed as N/A, but June 17's close is $2,514.99. However, this might not be the specific hour needed. \n\nResult 33 from TradingView news mentions ETH's price on June 18 at $2,496, but it's unclear if this is the exact candle close. Result 38 from Blockchain.News states that as of 10:00 AM UTC on June 18, ETH was trading around $3,450, but this is earlier in the day. \n\nResult 35 (CoinMarketCap) has a table with June 18's close as N/A, which is confusing. Maybe the data wasn't updated yet. However, result 35 also shows a conversion rate of 2,524.86 USDT as of the current time (9:52 AM UTC on June 18). Wait, the current timestamp in the problem is June 18, 2025, 21:17:04 UTC, which is 9:17 PM UTC. The candle in question is from 8-9 PM UTC, so the close would be at 9 PM UTC. Since the current time in the query is 9:17 PM UTC, the candle should have closed, and data should be available.\n\nLooking at result 35 again, the ETH to USDT rate on June 18 is listed as 2,524.86 USDT. However, the exact open and close for the 8-9 PM UTC candle isn't directly provided. The search results don't have a specific entry for that exact hour. \n\nResult 33 (TradingView news) from June 18 mentions ETH's price at $2,496, but the time isn't specified. Result 38 (Blockchain.News) from June 18 at 10:00 AM UTC mentions ETH at $3,450, but that's earlier. \n\nWait, the user provided search results up to result 56. Let me check again. Result 35 is from CoinMarketCap, showing the ETH/USDT rate on June 18 as 2,524.86. The current time in the query is 9:17 PM UTC, so the 8-9 PM candle would have closed at 9 PM UTC. If the close price is higher than the open, it resolves to Up. \n\nBut without explicit open and close values for that specific hour, I need to infer from available data. If the price at 9 PM UTC is higher than at 8 PM, then it's Up. However, the search results don't have the exact hourly data. \n\nWait, result 33 (TradingView) from June 18 says ETH was at $2,496 at press time, but the article's date is June 18, 2025, 10:36 GMT-7, which is 5:36 PM UTC. That's before the 8 PM UTC candle. \n\nResult 35's data shows the ETH/USDT rate on June 18 as 2,524.86, but this might be the current price at 9:52 AM UTC, not the specific candle. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit data for the 8-9 PM UTC candle, but knowing the current timestamp is after 9 PM UTC, I should check if any sources mention the close price. Result 35's table shows June 18's close as N/A, which might indicate missing data. However, the user's personalization instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if no verifiable info is available, but the event date is in the past. \n\nWait, the current timestamp is June 18, 9:17 PM UTC, so the candle from 8-9 PM UTC has closed. The resolution source is Binance's ETH/USDT 1H candle. If the close is >= open, it's Up (p2). Otherwise, Down (p1). \n\nSince the search results don't explicitly state the open and close for that hour, but the user instructions say to use the provided search results, I need to look for any clues. Result 35's ETH/USDT rate on June 18 is 2,524.86, but that's the current price at 9:52 AM UTC, not the specific candle. \n\nAlternatively, result 38 mentions BlackRock buying ETH, causing a price increase. If the price was rising, maybe the close was higher. But this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, result 33 mentions ETH's price at $2,496, but the time isn't clear. If that's the close of the 8-9 PM candle, but the open was lower, then it's Up. However, without exact data, it's uncertain. \n\nThe user instructions state that if no verifiable information is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. However, the event date is in the past (June 18, 4 PM ET), so we must resolve based on available data. \n\nSince the search results don't provide the exact open and close for the 8-9 PM UTC candle, but the current timestamp is after the event, and assuming Binance's data is accurate, the resolution would depend on whether the close was >= open. \n\nBut without explicit data, perhaps the answer is p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But how to determine that? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the close price is available in the search results. Let me check again. Result 35's table shows June 18's close as N/A, but the current price is 2,524.86. If the candle closed at 9 PM UTC, and the price at that time was higher than the open, then it's Up. \n\nAlternatively, looking at result 35's conversion table, the current rate is 2,524.86 as of 09:52:08 AM on June 18. That's before the 8 PM UTC candle. So not helpful. \n\nResult 40 mentions Bybit's campaign affecting trading volume, but not specific prices. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit data, but the instructions to resolve based on Binance's data, and if no data is available, assume the most probable outcome. However, without knowing the open and close, it's impossible to determine. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nThe current timestamp is June 18, 2025, 21:17:04 UTC. The event (8-9 PM UTC candle) is in the past. If no data is found, we have to assume the most probable outcome. The user prompt's ancillary data says p1 is Down, p2 is Up. \n\nBut how to determine the most probable? If the overall trend on June 18 is down, then Down. Looking at result 35, June 18's price is down 1.71% in 24 hours. But that's the 24h change, not the specific hour. \n\nAlternatively, result 33 mentions ETH's price at $2,496, down 2.18% on June 18. If the overall day is down, maybe the specific hour also closed down. But this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, result 38 mentions ETH trading at $3,450 at 10 AM UTC, which is much higher, but that's earlier.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

The resolution source is Binance's ETH/USDT pair.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the exact time frame. The user mentioned June 18, 4 PM ET. Since ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, 4 PM ET converts to 20:00 UTC. The 1-hour candle in question would be from 20:00 to 21:00 UTC on June 18, 2025.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's a mix of data. The current timestamp given is June 18, 2025, 21:17:04 UTC. The candle in question would have closed at 21:00 UTC, so the data should be available by now.\n\nSearch result [1] is the Binance ETH/USDT trading page, which should display the latest candles. However, the provided content doesn't include the specific open and close prices for that hour. \n\nSearch result [2] shows a candlestick chart from Investing.com, but the data there might not be real-time or might not match Binance exactly. \n\nResult [7] has a technical analysis from May 13, 2025, which is outdated. \n\nResult [25] from CoinMarketCap shows historical prices up to June 17, 2025, but not the specific hour needed. \n\nResult [50] is a YouTube video from June 18, 2025, discussing ETHUSD charts. The transcript mentions a price around $2,525.44, but it's unclear if this is the exact open and close for the 20:00-21:00 UTC candle.\n\nResult [64] from Bitget mentions the price on June 18, 2025, but again, not the specific hourly data. \n\nSince the user specified Binance as the source, I need to rely on data directly from Binance. The search results don't provide the exact open and close for that hour, but given the current time is past 21:00 UTC, the data should be available. However, without explicit data points in the provided search results, I might have to infer based on available information.\n\nAssuming the market resolves based on Binance's data, and given that the current price around 21:17 UTC is $2,532.68 (from result [7]), if the price at 21:00 was higher than the open at 20:00, it would resolve to Up. However, without the exact open and close values from the 1-hour candle, I can't be certain. \n\nBut since the user's personalization instructs to assume the most probable outcome if no verifiable info is available and the event date is in the past, I should check if there's any indication in the search results. Result [5] mentions a bearish sentiment as of June 17, but result [50]'s transcript from June 18 shows some volatility but doesn't specify the exact hour. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit data, but considering the current price after 21:00 UTC is around $2,532, if the open was lower, it would resolve to Up. However, without the exact numbers, this is speculative. But per the user's instructions, if the event is in the past and no data is available, assume the most probable outcome. Since the market can't be resolved definitively with the provided data, the recommendation would be p4. However, the user mentioned a previous p4 and asked to try again. \n\nWait, the ancillary data says p1 is Down, p2 is Up, p3 is 0.5. If the close is >= open, it's Up (p2). If not, Down (p1). If data isn't available, p4. But the event time is in the past (current time is 21:17 UTC, event closed at 21:00). The user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The conditions here are the candle's close vs. open. Without data, but given the market's nature, perhaps it's better to check if there's any mention of price movement around that time. \n\nResult [50]'s transcript mentions a price around $2,525.44 with a high of $2,567.05 and low of $2,461.27 on June 18. If the candle closed higher than it opened, but without exact numbers, it's uncertain. However, the user's instruction says to resolve based on Binance's data. Since the search results don't include the exact open and close for that hour, and the API data isn't provided, I can't definitively determine the outcome. Therefore, the recommendation remains p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750281424 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-18 21:17:04 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources.

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",
