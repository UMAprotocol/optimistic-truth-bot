Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.

Recommendation found: p4.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p4\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.0175, ID: 54666090682207049531363683786173052719468883083726858777690382672802708017687, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.9825, ID: 108110321157283409759272136452529240614550116600544917519749516026310279550777, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.983 = 98.2% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date.

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.983 = 98.2% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market prediction about whether the SOL/USDT price on Binance will go up or down during the 1-hour candle starting June 18 at 4 AM ET. The resolution depends on the close price being greater than or equal to the open price for that specific candle.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the exact time of the candle in UTC because Binance uses UTC for their timestamps. The event is scheduled for June 18, 4 AM ET. Eastern Time (ET) is UTC-4 during Daylight Saving Time. So converting 4 AM ET to UTC would be 8 AM UTC. However, I should double-check the time zone conversion to make sure. Let me verify the current date and time: the current timestamp given is 1750238055, which is Wednesday, June 18, 2025, 9:14:15 UTC. The event time is June 18, 4 AM ET, which is 8 AM UTC on the same day. Since the current time is 9:14 AM UTC, the candle in question (8 AM to 9 AM UTC) has already closed. \n\nNext, I need to retrieve the open and close prices for the 1-hour candle starting at 8 AM UTC. The user provided several search results, including Binance API documentation and third-party sources. The key here is to use Binance's official data. According to the Binance API documentation (search results [1], [3], [48], [49]), the kline/candlestick data can be fetched using the /api/v3/klines endpoint with the interval set to '1h'. The parameters would include the symbol SOLUSDT, interval '1h', startTime, and endTime. \n\nThe startTime for the candle in question is June 18, 2025, 8:00:00 AM UTC, which in Unix milliseconds is 1750219200000. The endTime would be 1750222800000 (8:00 AM + 1 hour). However, since the candle has already closed, the data should be available. \n\nLooking at the search results, there are some price data points. For example, search result [9] mentions SOL trading at $147.74 on June 18, 2025, at an unspecified time. Search result [10] shows the SOL/USDT rate on June 18 as 147.50 USDT, with a 24h decrease. However, these might not be specific to the exact 1-hour window. \n\nAnother approach is to check the historical data from the provided sources. Search result [13] and [15] list historical data for SOLUSD. For June 18, the opening price is around $146.390, and the closing price is $152.220, but this might be daily data, not hourly. Similarly, search result [12] from June 14 mentions SOL trading at $145.32 with specific technical indicators, but that's a different date. \n\nThe critical point is to get the exact open and close for the 8 AM UTC 1-hour candle. Since the current time is past that, the data should be available. However, the provided search results don't have the exact hourly data points. The user might need to query the Binance API directly, but since I can't execute live queries, I have to rely on the given data. \n\nWait, search result [12] from June 14, 2025, at 10:00 AM UTC mentions SOL's price and trading volume, but that's a different date. Search result [9] and [10] are from June 18 but don't specify the exact hour. The most recent data point in the search results is from [9], which states that as of June 18, 2025, SOL is trading at $147.74, down 1.98% from the previous close, with a high of $154.04 and a low of $145.77. However, this is a daily timeframe, not hourly. \n\nGiven that the resolution source is Binance's SOL/USDT pair, and the specific 1-hour candle from 8 AM to 9 AM UTC on June 18, 2025, I need to determine if the close was >= open. Since the current time is 9:14 AM UTC, the candle has closed, and the data should be available. However, without the exact numbers from the search results, I might have to infer based on the available data. \n\nLooking at the historical data in search result [13], the entry for June 18 shows a high of $152.220 and a low of $140.980, but this is daily data. The opening price on June 18 (daily) is $146.390, and the close is $152.220, which is higher, but again, this is daily, not hourly. \n\nThe user's query is about the 1-hour candle specifically. Since the search results don't provide the exact hourly open and close, but the current time is after the candle's close, and assuming the market resolved based on the hourly data, I need to check if there's any mention of the price movement during that specific hour. \n\nSearch result [12] from June 14 mentions a 4-hour chart analysis, but that's not relevant here. The key is that the user's ancillary data specifies that the resolution is based on Binance's SOL/USDT 1H candle starting at the specified time. \n\nGiven that the current UTC time is past the candle's close, and assuming that the close price is higher than the open (as per the daily data showing an increase), but without explicit hourly data in the search results, I might have to default to the most probable outcome. However, the instructions state that if no verifiable information is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nWait, the personalization section says: \"If an event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" \n\nIn this case, the event date is in the past (June 18, 8 AM UTC), and the current time is after that. The user provided Binance as the source, but the search results don't have the exact hourly data. However, search result [9] from Bitget on June 18, 2025, states SOL is at $147.74, down 1.98% from the previous close. If the previous close refers to the prior day, that might not help. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the 1-hour data, if the price was trending down during that hour, the close could be lower. But without explicit data, it's challenging. However, the user's query might require checking if the specific candle's close is >= open. \n\nSince the search results don't provide the exact numbers, but the current time is after the event, and the user instruction says to resolve based on the most probable outcome if no data is available, but the event has occurred, I need to check if there's any conflicting information. \n\nWait, the personalization also states: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\" The user provided a URL to Binance's SOL/USDT trading page (search result [53], [64]). However, the search results don't include the actual price data from that URL, just the structure of the page. \n\nGiven that, and the lack of explicit hourly data in the search results, I might have to conclude that there's no verifiable information in the provided context to determine the outcome. However, the event date is in the past, and the instructions say to assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. \n\nThe ancillary data defines p1 as Down, p2 as Up. If we can't verify, but the event has occurred, and assuming that the market can't be resolved as p4 (cannot resolve), but the instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the close was lower than the open. Given that the daily data shows a decrease (search result [9] mentions a 1.98% decrease), but that's daily, not hourly. Without specific hourly data, but the instructions require using the provided sources, which don't have the exact data, I might have to default to p4. However, the personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nWait, the exact wording: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nIn this case, the most probable outcome would depend on the market conditions. If the overall trend is down, maybe it's more probable to resolve to Down. However, without specific data, it's uncertain. But the user's instructions might require a definitive answer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is p4 because the provided search results don't have the exact data. But the event has occurred, and the resolver should check Binance. Since the resolver can't access live data, but the user provided the context, maybe there's a way to infer. \n\nWait, search result [12] from June 14 mentions SOL's price at $145.32, but that's a different date. Search result [9] from June 18 states SOL is at $147.74, down 1.98% from the previous close. If the previous close was the prior day's close, that doesn't help the hourly candle. \n\nGiven the lack of specific data in the provided context, but the event time has passed, the resolver should check the source (Binance) but can't due to limitations. Therefore, according to the instructions, if no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nBut how to determine the most probable? If the market is about whether the close is >= open, and without data, it's 50-50. However, the ancillary data defines p3 as 0.5, but the resolver should choose p1 or p2. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is p4 because the data isn't available in the provided context. However, the instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if the event date is in the past and no info. \n\nThis is a bit conflicting. Since the event has occurred, but the provided search results don't have the exact data, the resolver should return p4. However, the personalization says to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nWait, the exact instruction: \"If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nIn this case, the event has occurred (current time is after the candle close), but the provided search results don't have the exact data. Therefore, the resolver should assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThe ancillary data says p1 is Down, p2 is Up. Without data, it's 50-50, but the instructions say to assume the most probable. However, in the absence of data, perhaps the resolver can't determine and should return p4. But the instructions say to assume the most probable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the resolver should check the price movement around that time. For example, if the overall daily trend is down, the hourly candle might also be down. Search result [9] mentions a daily decrease of 1.98%, but that's the daily change, not the hourly. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and lack of specific data in the provided context, the safest recommendation is p4, indicating insufficient data to resolve. However, the instructions say to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the resolver should look for the closest available data. For example, search result [10] shows on June 18, the SOL/USDT rate is 147.50 USDT, with a 24h decrease of 2.86%. If the hourly candle during 8-9 AM UTC was part of a downward trend, the close might be lower than the open. \n\nBut this is speculative. Without explicit data, it's risky. However, the instructions mandate that if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nGiven that the daily trend is down, it's more probable that the hourly candle also closed lower. Therefore, the resolver might recommend p1 (Down). \n\nBut this is an assumption. The correct approach would be to check the exact candle data, which isn't present in the search results. Therefore, the resolver should return p4. However, the instructions say to assume the most probable. \n\nThis is a tough call. Given the conflict between the need to verify and the lack of data, but the instruction to assume the most probable, I think the answer is p4 because the provided context doesn't have the exact data, and the resolver can't access live data. However, the personalization says to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nWait, the user's query includes a URL to Binance's SOL/USDT page, but the search results don't include the actual price data from that URL. Therefore, the resolver can't verify the outcome and should return p4. \n\nBut the current time is after the event, and the resolver is supposed to check. However, without the data in the provided context, it's impossible. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750238055 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-18 09:14:15 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market prediction about whether the SOL/USDT price on Binance will go up or down during the 1-hour candle starting June 18 at 4 AM ET. The resolution depends on the close price being greater than or equal to the open price for that specific candle.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the exact time of the candle in UTC because Binance uses UTC for their timestamps. The event is scheduled for June 18, 4 AM ET. Eastern Time (ET) is UTC-4 during Daylight Saving Time. So converting 4 AM ET to UTC would be 8 AM UTC. However, I should double-check the time zone conversion to make sure. Let me verify the current date and time: the current timestamp given is 1750238055, which is Wednesday, June 18, 2025, 9:14:15 UTC. The event time is June 18, 4 AM ET, which is 8 AM UTC on the same day. Since the current time is 9:14 AM UTC, the candle in question (8 AM to 9 AM UTC) has already closed. \n\nNext, I need to retrieve the open and close prices for the 1-hour candle starting at 8 AM UTC. The user provided several search results, including Binance API documentation and third-party sources. The key here is to use Binance's official data. According to the Binance API documentation (search results [1], [3], [48], [49]), the kline/candlestick data can be fetched using the /api/v3/klines endpoint with the interval set to '1h'. The parameters would include the symbol SOLUSDT, interval '1h', startTime, and endTime. \n\nThe startTime for the candle in question is June 18, 2025, 8:00:00 AM UTC, which in Unix milliseconds is 1750219200000. The endTime would be 1750222800000 (8:00 AM + 1 hour). However, since the candle has already closed, the data should be available. \n\nLooking at the search results, there are some price data points. For example, search result [9] mentions SOL trading at $147.74 on June 18, 2025, at an unspecified time. Search result [10] shows the SOL/USDT rate on June 18 as 147.50 USDT, with a 24h decrease. However, these might not be specific to the exact 1-hour window. \n\nAnother approach is to check the historical data from the provided sources. Search result [13] and [15] list historical data for SOLUSD. For June 18, the opening price is around $146.390, and the closing price is $152.220, but this might be daily data, not hourly. Similarly, search result [12] from June 14 mentions SOL trading at $145.32 with specific technical indicators, but that's a different date. \n\nThe critical point is to get the exact open and close for the 8 AM UTC 1-hour candle. Since the current time is past that, the data should be available. However, the provided search results don't have the exact hourly data points. The user might need to query the Binance API directly, but since I can't execute live queries, I have to rely on the given data. \n\nWait, search result [12] from June 14, 2025, at 10:00 AM UTC mentions SOL's price and trading volume, but that's a different date. Search result [9] and [10] are from June 18 but don't specify the exact hour. The most recent data point in the search results is from [9], which states that as of June 18, 2025, SOL is trading at $147.74, down 1.98% from the previous close, with a high of $154.04 and a low of $145.77. However, this is a daily timeframe, not hourly. \n\nGiven that the resolution source is Binance's SOL/USDT pair, and the specific 1-hour candle from 8 AM to 9 AM UTC on June 18, 2025, I need to determine if the close was >= open. Since the current time is 9:14 AM UTC, the candle has closed, and the data should be available. However, without the exact numbers from the search results, I might have to infer based on the available data. \n\nLooking at the historical data in search result [13], the entry for June 18 shows a high of $152.220 and a low of $140.980, but this is daily data. The opening price on June 18 (daily) is $146.390, and the close is $152.220, which is higher, but again, this is daily, not hourly. \n\nThe user's query is about the 1-hour candle specifically. Since the search results don't provide the exact hourly open and close, but the current time is after the candle's close, and assuming the market resolved based on the hourly data, I need to check if there's any mention of the price movement during that specific hour. \n\nSearch result [12] from June 14 mentions a 4-hour chart analysis, but that's not relevant here. The key is that the user's ancillary data specifies that the resolution is based on Binance's SOL/USDT 1H candle starting at the specified time. \n\nGiven that the current UTC time is past the candle's close, and assuming that the close price is higher than the open (as per the daily data showing an increase), but without explicit hourly data in the search results, I might have to default to the most probable outcome. However, the instructions state that if no verifiable information is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nWait, the personalization section says: \"If an event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" \n\nIn this case, the event date is in the past (June 18, 8 AM UTC), and the current time is after that. The user provided Binance as the source, but the search results don't have the exact hourly data. However, search result [9] from Bitget on June 18, 2025, states SOL is at $147.74, down 1.98% from the previous close. If the previous close refers to the prior day, that might not help. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the 1-hour data, if the price was trending down during that hour, the close could be lower. But without explicit data, it's challenging. However, the user's query might require checking if the specific candle's close is >= open. \n\nSince the search results don't provide the exact numbers, but the current time is after the event, and the user instruction says to resolve based on the most probable outcome if no data is available, but the event has occurred, I need to check if there's any conflicting information. \n\nWait, the personalization also states: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\" The user provided a URL to Binance's SOL/USDT trading page (search result [53], [64]). However, the search results don't include the actual price data from that URL, just the structure of the page. \n\nGiven that, and the lack of explicit hourly data in the search results, I might have to conclude that there's no verifiable information in the provided context to determine the outcome. However, the event date is in the past, and the instructions say to assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. \n\nThe ancillary data defines p1 as Down, p2 as Up. If we can't verify, but the event has occurred, and assuming that the market can't be resolved as p4 (cannot resolve), but the instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the close was lower than the open. Given that the daily data shows a decrease (search result [9] mentions a 1.98% decrease), but that's daily, not hourly. Without specific hourly data, but the instructions require using the provided sources, which don't have the exact data, I might have to default to p4. However, the personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nWait, the exact wording: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nIn this case, the most probable outcome would depend on the market conditions. If the overall trend is down, maybe it's more probable to resolve to Down. However, without specific data, it's uncertain. But the user's instructions might require a definitive answer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is p4 because the provided search results don't have the exact data. But the event has occurred, and the resolver should check Binance. Since the resolver can't access live data, but the user provided the context, maybe there's a way to infer. \n\nWait, search result [12] from June 14 mentions SOL's price at $145.32, but that's a different date. Search result [9] from June 18 states SOL is at $147.74, down 1.98% from the previous close. If the previous close was the prior day's close, that doesn't help the hourly candle. \n\nGiven the lack of specific data in the provided context, but the event time has passed, the resolver should check the source (Binance) but can't due to limitations. Therefore, according to the instructions, if no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nBut how to determine the most probable? If the market is about whether the close is >= open, and without data, it's 50-50. However, the ancillary data defines p3 as 0.5, but the resolver should choose p1 or p2. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is p4 because the data isn't available in the provided context. However, the instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if the event date is in the past and no info. \n\nThis is a bit conflicting. Since the event has occurred, but the provided search results don't have the exact data, the resolver should return p4. However, the personalization says to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nWait, the exact instruction: \"If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nIn this case, the event has occurred (current time is after the candle close), but the provided search results don't have the exact data. Therefore, the resolver should assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThe ancillary data says p1 is Down, p2 is Up. Without data, it's 50-50, but the instructions say to assume the most probable. However, in the absence of data, perhaps the resolver can't determine and should return p4. But the instructions say to assume the most probable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the resolver should check the price movement around that time. For example, if the overall daily trend is down, the hourly candle might also be down. Search result [9] mentions a daily decrease of 1.98%, but that's the daily change, not the hourly. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and lack of specific data in the provided context, the safest recommendation is p4, indicating insufficient data to resolve. However, the instructions say to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the resolver should look for the closest available data. For example, search result [10] shows on June 18, the SOL/USDT rate is 147.50 USDT, with a 24h decrease of 2.86%. If the hourly candle during 8-9 AM UTC was part of a downward trend, the close might be lower than the open. \n\nBut this is speculative. Without explicit data, it's risky. However, the instructions mandate that if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nGiven that the daily trend is down, it's more probable that the hourly candle also closed lower. Therefore, the resolver might recommend p1 (Down). \n\nBut this is an assumption. The correct approach would be to check the exact candle data, which isn't present in the search results. Therefore, the resolver should return p4. However, the instructions say to assume the most probable. \n\nThis is a tough call. Given the conflict between the need to verify and the lack of data, but the instruction to assume the most probable, I think the answer is p4 because the provided context doesn't have the exact data, and the resolver can't access live data. However, the personalization says to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nWait, the user's query includes a URL to Binance's SOL/USDT page, but the search results don't include the actual price data from that URL. Therefore, the resolver can't verify the outcome and should return p4. \n\nBut the current time is after the event, and the resolver is supposed to check. However, without the data in the provided context, it's impossible. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.0175, ID: 54666090682207049531363683786173052719468883083726858777690382672802708017687, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.9825, ID: 108110321157283409759272136452529240614550116600544917519749516026310279550777, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the SOL/USDT 1-hour candle starting on June 18 at 4 AM ET closed higher or lower than its open. The resolution depends on Binance's data for that specific candle.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp given is June 18, 2025, 09:14:15 UTC. ET is UTC-4, so 4 AM ET would be 8 AM UTC. The candle in question started at 8 AM UTC and ended at 9 AM UTC. Since the current time is 09:14 UTC, the candle has just closed, and the data should be available.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources provide SOL/USDT price data. For example, result [1] shows the SOL to BNB rate, but we need SOL/USDT. Result [2] lists SOL/USDT prices on various exchanges, with Binance showing $147.93. Result [3] mentions SOL trading at $147.74 on Bitget. Result [4] from Kitco shows SOL at $147.53. Result [5] from Coingape has SOL at $142.43, but this might be outdated. Result [6] from CoinMarketCap lists the live price as $148.64. Result [19] from CoinMarketCap again shows SOL/USDT at 147.49 USDT. Result [26] from Binance Futures shows the mark price at 148.29. Result [35] from TradingView mentions the current price as 148.24 USDT. Result [44] from coinalyze.net shows the price at 148.17 with a -2.16% change in the last 24 hours.\n\nWait, there's a discrepancy here. Different sources might have slightly different prices due to exchange variations. But the user specified Binance's SOL/USDT pair. Looking at result [41], the Binance spot trade page for SOL/USDT shows a price of 147.17. However, result [35] from TradingView, which aggregates data from Binance, shows 148.24 USDT. Result [19] from CoinMarketCap's SOL/USDT converter indicates a rate of 147.49 USDT as of June 18, 2025. \n\nThe key is to find the open and close prices for the specific 1-hour candle from 8 AM to 9 AM UTC. The search results don't explicitly list this, but we can infer from the data. If the price decreased by 2.86% in the last 24 hours (result [19]), but the current price is around $147.49, and considering the 1-hour movement, we need to check if during that specific hour the price went up or down.\n\nResult [35] on TradingView mentions the current price is 148.24 USDT, down 0.02% in the past 24 hours. However, this might not be the specific 1-hour window. Result [44] shows a 24h high of 154.29 and low of 145.55, but again, not the exact hour. \n\nSince the current time is just after 9 AM UTC, the candle closed at 9 AM. If the close price is higher than the open at 8 AM, it's \"Up\". Given the slight decrease in the last hour (result [19] mentions a 2.86% decrease in 24h, but the specific hour might have varied), but without exact open and close values, it's challenging. However, looking at result [35], the price is 148.24, and considering the previous data points, if the open was around 148.24 and the close is slightly lower, it would be \"Down\". But without precise data, this is uncertain.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the resolution source is Binance's SOL/USDT pair, specifically the 1H candle's open and close. The search results include Binance's own data. Result [41] is the Binance spot trade page, but the data there might not show historical candles. However, result [15] from a Binance API tutorial mentions how to fetch klines (candlestick data). The user's query is about the 1H candle starting at 4 AM ET (8 AM UTC). \n\nGiven that the current time is 09:14 UTC, the candle from 8-9 AM UTC has just closed. The close price would be the price at 9 AM UTC. If the close is higher than the open (8 AM price), it's \"Up\". \n\nLooking at the latest data points around this time: result [35] on TradingView (as of the current timestamp) shows the price at 148.24 USDT. If the open at 8 AM was lower than this, then it's Up. However, without the exact open and close values, it's hard to be certain. But considering the overall downward trend in the last 24 hours (as per multiple sources showing a decrease), it's possible the 1H candle closed lower. \n\nHowever, the ancillary data specifies that the resolution is based on Binance's displayed O and C for that specific 1H candle. Since the user's previous attempt returned p4 (unknown), they want a recheck. The key is to find the exact open and close for that 1H candle. \n\nLooking at result [19], the SOL/USDT rate history table shows Jun 18, 2025, at 0.2277 BNB, but that's SOL/BNB. Result [19] also mentions the SOL/USDT conversion rate today is 147.49 USDT, down 2.86% in 24h. Result [35] on TradingView shows the current price as 148.24 USDT, down 0.02%. \n\nAssuming that at 8 AM UTC, the open was around 148.24, and by 9 AM it closed at 147.49, that would be a decrease, resolving to \"Down\". However, without precise historical data for that exact hour, this is an assumption. \n\nAlternatively, if the candle's open was 147.49 and close is 147.49, it's flat, but the condition is close >= open. If they are equal, it's \"Up\". But given the market's movement, it's more likely there was a slight decrease. \n\nSince the user needs a definitive answer, and the data isn't explicitly available in the search results, but the current price after the candle's close is lower than previous hours, it's reasonable to resolve to \"Down\" (p1). However, if the close was equal to or higher than open, it's \"Up\" (p2). Given the uncertainty, but following the instruction to use Binance's data, and considering the overall downward trend, the recommendation would be p1 (Down). But wait, the market resolves to Up if close >= open. If the close is exactly equal, it's Up. Without exact data, but given the 24h decrease, it's possible the 1H candle also decreased. Therefore, the recommendation is p1 (Down).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.

The user wants to know if the SOL/USDT 1-hour candle starting on June 18 at 4 AM ET closed higher or lower than its open. The resolution depends on Binance's data for that specific candle.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp given is June 18, 2025, 09:14:15 UTC. ET is UTC-4, so 4 AM ET would be 8 AM UTC. The candle in question started at 8 AM UTC and ended at 9 AM UTC. Since the current time is 09:14 UTC, the candle has just closed, and the data should be available.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources provide SOL/USDT price data. For example, result [1] shows the SOL to BNB rate, but we need SOL/USDT. Result [2] lists SOL/USDT prices on various exchanges, with Binance showing $147.93. Result [3] mentions SOL trading at $147.74 on Bitget. Result [4] from Kitco shows SOL at $147.53. Result [5] from Coingape has SOL at $142.43, but this might be outdated. Result [6] from CoinMarketCap lists the live price as $148.64. Result [19] from CoinMarketCap again shows SOL/USDT at 147.49 USDT. Result [26] from Binance Futures shows the mark price at 148.29. Result [35] from TradingView mentions the current price as 148.24 USDT. Result [44] from coinalyze.net shows the price at 148.17 with a -2.16% change in the last 24 hours.\n\nWait, there's a discrepancy here. Different sources might have slightly different prices due to exchange variations. But the user specified Binance's SOL/USDT pair. Looking at result [41], the Binance spot trade page for SOL/USDT shows a price of 147.17. However, result [35] from TradingView, which aggregates data from Binance, shows 148.24 USDT. Result [19] from CoinMarketCap's SOL/USDT converter indicates a rate of 147.49 USDT as of June 18, 2025. \n\nThe key is to find the open and close prices for the specific 1-hour candle from 8 AM to 9 AM UTC. The search results don't explicitly list this, but we can infer from the data. If the price decreased by 2.86% in the last 24 hours (result [19]), but the current price is around $147.49, and considering the 1-hour movement, we need to check if during that specific hour the price went up or down.\n\nResult [35] on TradingView mentions the current price is 148.24 USDT, down 0.02% in the past 24 hours. However, this might not be the specific 1-hour window. Result [44] shows a 24h high of 154.29 and low of 145.55, but again, not the exact hour. \n\nSince the current time is just after 9 AM UTC, the candle closed at 9 AM. If the close price is higher than the open at 8 AM, it's \"Up\". Given the slight decrease in the last hour (result [19] mentions a 2.86% decrease in 24h, but the specific hour might have varied), but without exact open and close values, it's challenging. However, looking at result [35], the price is 148.24, and considering the previous data points, if the open was around 148.24 and the close is slightly lower, it would be \"Down\". But without precise data, this is uncertain.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the resolution source is Binance's SOL/USDT pair, specifically the 1H candle's open and close. The search results include Binance's own data. Result [41] is the Binance spot trade page, but the data there might not show historical candles. However, result [15] from a Binance API tutorial mentions how to fetch klines (candlestick data). The user's query is about the 1H candle starting at 4 AM ET (8 AM UTC). \n\nGiven that the current time is 09:14 UTC, the candle from 8-9 AM UTC has just closed. The close price would be the price at 9 AM UTC. If the close is higher than the open (8 AM price), it's \"Up\". \n\nLooking at the latest data points around this time: result [35] on TradingView (as of the current timestamp) shows the price at 148.24 USDT. If the open at 8 AM was lower than this, then it's Up. However, without the exact open and close values, it's hard to be certain. But considering the overall downward trend in the last 24 hours (as per multiple sources showing a decrease), it's possible the 1H candle closed lower. \n\nHowever, the ancillary data specifies that the resolution is based on Binance's displayed O and C for that specific 1H candle. Since the user's previous attempt returned p4 (unknown), they want a recheck. The key is to find the exact open and close for that 1H candle. \n\nLooking at result [19], the SOL/USDT rate history table shows Jun 18, 2025, at 0.2277 BNB, but that's SOL/BNB. Result [19] also mentions the SOL/USDT conversion rate today is 147.49 USDT, down 2.86% in 24h. Result [35] on TradingView shows the current price as 148.24 USDT, down 0.02%. \n\nAssuming that at 8 AM UTC, the open was around 148.24, and by 9 AM it closed at 147.49, that would be a decrease, resolving to \"Down\". However, without precise historical data for that exact hour, this is an assumption. \n\nAlternatively, if the candle's open was 147.49 and close is 147.49, it's flat, but the condition is close >= open. If they are equal, it's \"Up\". But given the market's movement, it's more likely there was a slight decrease. \n\nSince the user needs a definitive answer, and the data isn't explicitly available in the search results, but the current price after the candle's close is lower than previous hours, it's reasonable to resolve to \"Down\" (p1). However, if the close was equal to or higher than open, it's \"Up\" (p2). Given the uncertainty, but following the instruction to use Binance's data, and considering the overall downward trend, the recommendation would be p1 (Down). But wait, the market resolves to Up if close >= open. If the close is exactly equal, it's Up. Without exact data, but given the 24h decrease, it's possible the 1H candle also decreased. Therefore, the recommendation is p1 (Down).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.0175, ID: 54666090682207049531363683786173052719468883083726858777690382672802708017687, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.9825, ID: 108110321157283409759272136452529240614550116600544917519749516026310279550777, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.983 = 98.2% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "prompt": "You are an expert router for UMA's optimistic oracle system. Your task is to analyze the provided query and decide which AI solver is best suited to handle it.\n\nAvailable solvers: perplexity\n\nSolver descriptions:\n- perplexity: Uses the Perplexity AI search engine to find information online to answer general questions. Best for:\n  * Historical data and events\n  * General knowledge questions requiring context\n  * Questions needing interpretation of complex information\n  * Has knowledge cutoff and may not have very recent information\n\n- code_runner: Executes code to fetch real-time data from specific APIs. Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Currently available data sources based on API keys:\n    - MLB (Major League Baseball) data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Solana Up or Down - June 18, 4 AM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the the close price is greater than or equal to the open price for the SOL/USDT 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the SOL/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/SOL_USDT). The close \u00c2\u00ab\u00c2\u00a0C\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00bb and open \u00c2\u00ab\u00c2\u00a0O\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00bb displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance SOL/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets. market_id: 552921\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",
