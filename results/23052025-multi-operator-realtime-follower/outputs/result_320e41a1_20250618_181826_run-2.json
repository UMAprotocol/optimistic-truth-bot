Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.

Recommendation found: p3.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p3\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.98, ID: 52379602938344345796695100810788610467841755331096738152608421000606630840928, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.02, ID: 111534091209611728821961949472301059081282272237150226382275694551129598435815, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.980 = 98.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date.

Recommendation found: p3.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p3\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.98, ID: 52379602938344345796695100810788610467841755331096738152608421000606630840928, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.02, ID: 111534091209611728821961949472301059081282272237150226382275694551129598435815, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.980 = 98.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "routing_phase": 1,
      "prompt": null,
      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market that depends on whether the SOL/USDT 1-hour candle on Binance starting at June 18, 1 PM ET closes higher or equal to its open. The resolution is based on Binance's data for that specific candle.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the exact time frame of the 1-hour candle. The title mentions June 18, 1 PM ET. ET is Eastern Time, which is UTC-4 during daylight saving time. So 1 PM ET would be 17:00 UTC. The candle starts at 17:00 UTC and ends at 18:00 UTC. The current time given is 2025-06-18 18:12:24 UTC, which is after the candle's end time. So the candle has closed, and the data should be available.\n\nNext, I need to check the open and close prices for that specific 1-hour candle on Binance. The user provided several search results, including Binance API documentation for klines/candlestick data. The relevant endpoint for spot markets is GET /api/v3/klines with the interval set to 1h. The parameters would include the symbol SOLUSDT, interval=1h, startTime and endTime corresponding to 17:00 UTC and 18:00 UTC on June 18, 2025.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's a mention of SOL/USDT price data. For example, in search result [25], the current price is mentioned as $144.33, but that's from TradingView and might not be the specific candle. However, other results like [33] and [36] mention SOL prices around $145-153 around the relevant time. But I need the exact open and close from the 17:00-18:00 UTC candle.\n\nThe Binance API response includes an array where the first element is the open time, followed by open, high, low, close prices, etc. For the 1h candle starting at 17:00 UTC, the open would be the second element, and the close the fifth element in the array. If the close is >= open, resolve to Up (p2), else Down (p1).\n\nSince the current time is past 18:00 UTC, the candle's data should be finalized. However, the provided search results don't explicitly list the exact open and close for that specific hour. There's a mention in [33] of SOL trading at $153.07 on Binance, but without timestamps. Another result [36] from KuCoin mentions a price of $145, but that's their data, not Binance's.\n\nGiven that the user specified using Binance as the source, and the ancillary data requires using the open and close from the 1H candle on Binance, I might need to infer from the available data. However, the search results don't have the exact Binance candle data. But considering the current time is after the candle's close, and assuming the data is available, I need to check if any of the search results provide that specific information.\n\nWait, search result [5] mentions a changelog from Binance on 2024-07-22 about fixing kline timestamps. This suggests that the API should provide accurate timestamps. The user also provided the current Unix timestamp as 1750270344, which converts to 2025-06-18 18:12:24 UTC. The candle in question is from 17:00 to 18:00 UTC on the same day. \n\nSince the current time is after 18:00, the candle is closed. The close price would be the last traded price before 18:00. If the close is >= open, it's Up. However, without the exact open and close values from Binance in the search results, I might have to rely on the available data. \n\nLooking at search result [33], there's a mention of SOL/USDT at 153.07, but the time is 13:50. Another result [36] from KuCoin shows a price of $145, but that's KuCoin, not Binance. The user specified Binance as the source, so other exchanges' data isn't relevant here.\n\nGiven the lack of explicit Binance data for that specific hour in the provided search results, but knowing the event date is in the past, the resolution should default to the most probable outcome based on the conditions. However, the instructions say if no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome. But since the event has occurred, and the data should be available, perhaps the answer is p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nWait, the personalization instructions state: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" \n\nBut in this case, the event has occurred (time is past), but the search results don't have the specific Binance candle data. However, the user provided ancillary data with p1=Down, p2=Up. Without the actual data, but given the market's nature, perhaps the resolution is p3 (unknown). But the personalization says if no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, the instructions also say to use the provided URLs heavily. The user provided a URL to Binance's SOL/USDT pair, but the search results don't include the actual candle data from that URL.\n\nGiven the conflict, but following the instruction to resolve based on the most probable outcome if data is missing, but the event has occurred, I might have to check if any of the search results indicate the price movement during that hour. For example, in [33], there's a news item from June 18, 2025, 13:50 stating Solana is in a retracement, but that's before the candle time. Another news item at 09:54 mentions a decline from $160 to $145. However, the specific 17:00-18:00 UTC candle isn't detailed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is p4 because the specific data isn't present in the provided search results. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, without the data, it's impossible to determine. Therefore, the correct recommendation would be p4. But I need to check the instructions again.\n\nWait, the personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nIn this case, the available information doesn't include the specific Binance candle's open and close. Therefore, it cannot be reasonably inferred, so the recommendation should be p4. However, the user might expect the assistant to use the current price data from the search results. For example, if the price at 18:00 was higher than at 17:00, but without the exact numbers, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at search result [33], which mentions SOL/USDT at 153.07 on Binance as of the current time (18:12 UTC), but the candle closed at 18:00. If the price at 18:00 was 153.07, but the open was, say, 150, then it's up. But without the exact open and close, it's impossible to determine. Therefore, the safe answer is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750270344 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-18 18:12:24 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market that depends on whether the SOL/USDT 1-hour candle on Binance starting at June 18, 1 PM ET closes higher or equal to its open. The resolution is based on Binance's data for that specific candle.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the exact time frame of the 1-hour candle. The title mentions June 18, 1 PM ET. ET is Eastern Time, which is UTC-4 during daylight saving time. So 1 PM ET would be 17:00 UTC. The candle starts at 17:00 UTC and ends at 18:00 UTC. The current time given is 2025-06-18 18:12:24 UTC, which is after the candle's end time. So the candle has closed, and the data should be available.\n\nNext, I need to check the open and close prices for that specific 1-hour candle on Binance. The user provided several search results, including Binance API documentation for klines/candlestick data. The relevant endpoint for spot markets is GET /api/v3/klines with the interval set to 1h. The parameters would include the symbol SOLUSDT, interval=1h, startTime and endTime corresponding to 17:00 UTC and 18:00 UTC on June 18, 2025.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's a mention of SOL/USDT price data. For example, in search result [25], the current price is mentioned as $144.33, but that's from TradingView and might not be the specific candle. However, other results like [33] and [36] mention SOL prices around $145-153 around the relevant time. But I need the exact open and close from the 17:00-18:00 UTC candle.\n\nThe Binance API response includes an array where the first element is the open time, followed by open, high, low, close prices, etc. For the 1h candle starting at 17:00 UTC, the open would be the second element, and the close the fifth element in the array. If the close is >= open, resolve to Up (p2), else Down (p1).\n\nSince the current time is past 18:00 UTC, the candle's data should be finalized. However, the provided search results don't explicitly list the exact open and close for that specific hour. There's a mention in [33] of SOL trading at $153.07 on Binance, but without timestamps. Another result [36] from KuCoin mentions a price of $145, but that's their data, not Binance's.\n\nGiven that the user specified using Binance as the source, and the ancillary data requires using the open and close from the 1H candle on Binance, I might need to infer from the available data. However, the search results don't have the exact Binance candle data. But considering the current time is after the candle's close, and assuming the data is available, I need to check if any of the search results provide that specific information.\n\nWait, search result [5] mentions a changelog from Binance on 2024-07-22 about fixing kline timestamps. This suggests that the API should provide accurate timestamps. The user also provided the current Unix timestamp as 1750270344, which converts to 2025-06-18 18:12:24 UTC. The candle in question is from 17:00 to 18:00 UTC on the same day. \n\nSince the current time is after 18:00, the candle is closed. The close price would be the last traded price before 18:00. If the close is >= open, it's Up. However, without the exact open and close values from Binance in the search results, I might have to rely on the available data. \n\nLooking at search result [33], there's a mention of SOL/USDT at 153.07, but the time is 13:50. Another result [36] from KuCoin shows a price of $145, but that's KuCoin, not Binance. The user specified Binance as the source, so other exchanges' data isn't relevant here.\n\nGiven the lack of explicit Binance data for that specific hour in the provided search results, but knowing the event date is in the past, the resolution should default to the most probable outcome based on the conditions. However, the instructions say if no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome. But since the event has occurred, and the data should be available, perhaps the answer is p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nWait, the personalization instructions state: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" \n\nBut in this case, the event has occurred (time is past), but the search results don't have the specific Binance candle data. However, the user provided ancillary data with p1=Down, p2=Up. Without the actual data, but given the market's nature, perhaps the resolution is p3 (unknown). But the personalization says if no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, the instructions also say to use the provided URLs heavily. The user provided a URL to Binance's SOL/USDT pair, but the search results don't include the actual candle data from that URL.\n\nGiven the conflict, but following the instruction to resolve based on the most probable outcome if data is missing, but the event has occurred, I might have to check if any of the search results indicate the price movement during that hour. For example, in [33], there's a news item from June 18, 2025, 13:50 stating Solana is in a retracement, but that's before the candle time. Another news item at 09:54 mentions a decline from $160 to $145. However, the specific 17:00-18:00 UTC candle isn't detailed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is p4 because the specific data isn't present in the provided search results. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, without the data, it's impossible to determine. Therefore, the correct recommendation would be p4. But I need to check the instructions again.\n\nWait, the personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nIn this case, the available information doesn't include the specific Binance candle's open and close. Therefore, it cannot be reasonably inferred, so the recommendation should be p4. However, the user might expect the assistant to use the current price data from the search results. For example, if the price at 18:00 was higher than at 17:00, but without the exact numbers, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at search result [33], which mentions SOL/USDT at 153.07 on Binance as of the current time (18:12 UTC), but the candle closed at 18:00. If the price at 18:00 was 153.07, but the open was, say, 150, then it's up. But without the exact open and close, it's impossible to determine. Therefore, the safe answer is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.98, ID: 52379602938344345796695100810788610467841755331096738152608421000606630840928, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.02, ID: 111534091209611728821961949472301059081282272237150226382275694551129598435815, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.980 = 98.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on whether the SOL/USDT 1-hour candle on June 18, 1 PM ET closed up or down. The resolution depends on Binance's data for that specific candle.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The given timestamp is 2025-06-18 18:12:24 UTC. The event in question is June 18, 1 PM ET, which is 17:00 UTC. Since the current time is 18:12 UTC, the candle in question (1 PM ET) has already closed. So the event has occurred, and we need to determine the outcome.\n\nNext, I should look at the provided search results to find the relevant data. Search result [10] mentions that as of 10:00 AM UTC on June 18, SOL was trading at $112.50 on Binance, but that's earlier in the day. However, the key is the 1-hour candle starting at 1 PM ET (17:00 UTC). \n\nLooking at search result [5], there's a TradingView idea from June 13, 2025, discussing SOL/USDT price levels. But that's a few days prior. Search result [10] also includes a flash news from June 18, 2025, stating that SOL's price dropped 7.2% within 24 hours, trading around $112.50 at 10:00 AM UTC. However, this is before the 1 PM ET candle.\n\nSearch result [11] from Bitget's analysis as of June 18, 2025, mentions SOL trading at $147.55, but this might be a different pair or a discrepancy. Need to cross-verify. Wait, the user specified SOL/USDT on Binance, so I should focus on Binance data.\n\nSearch result [10] also includes technical indicators: SOL breached the 50-day moving average of $125.30 at 12:00 PM UTC, RSI at 28.4 (oversold). However, the 1 PM ET candle is at 17:00 UTC. The price at 12:00 PM UTC is $112.50, but we need the 17:00 UTC candle.\n\nSearch result [4] and [8] provide historical data tables. Let's check [4]: SOL/USDC on BitMart, but the user specified Binance's SOL/USDT. [8] is Solana's historical data, but the source isn't specified. The latest entry in [8] is 144.161, but the date isn't clear. \n\nWait, search result [10] has a FAQ section updated on June 18, 2025, mentioning SOL's price at $112.50 at 10:00 AM UTC. Later, at 12:00 PM UTC, the price was around $125.30. However, the 1 PM ET (17:00 UTC) candle's open and close prices aren't directly provided. \n\nSince the search results don't explicitly state the open and close for the specific 1-hour candle, I might need to infer. If the price was $112.50 at 10:00 AM and $147.55 later (from [11]), but that's conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the data in [10] indicates a continued drop. However, without explicit data for the 17:00 UTC candle, it's challenging.\n\nWait, the user's personalization instructions say that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p1 as Down (close < open), p2 as Up (close >= open). \n\nGiven the market's focus on the 1-hour candle starting at 1 PM ET (17:00 UTC) on June 18, and the current time is past that, but no explicit data in the search results, I might have to default to p4. However, the user's additional instruction says to try again if previous response was p4. \n\nWait, the user's previous response was p4, so I need to check alternative sources. The search results include [10], which mentions a 7.2% drop by 10:00 AM UTC, but that's before the event. The technical analysis in [10] at 12:00 PM UTC shows SOL at $125.30, RSI 28.4. If the price continued to drop, the 17:00 UTC candle might have closed lower than it opened. However, without exact data, it's uncertain.\n\nAlternatively, looking at [13], a Solana whale withdrew $52.7 million from Binance, which could be bullish, but that's speculative. [14] mentions Solana's price prediction for June 2025, but it's from June 1, predicting a possible drop to $127. However, the current date is June 18, so that's outdated.\n\nGiven the lack of explicit data for the specific candle, but the event has passed, and assuming the most probable outcome based on conditions, if the price was in a downtrend (as per [10]), the close might be lower than open. However, without concrete data, the safe answer is p4 (cannot resolve). But the user wants to avoid p4. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data says p1 is Down, p2 Up. If the market can't be verified, but the event has occurred, and assuming the most probable outcome based on conditions. If the price was dropping, maybe p1. But without data, it's a guess. However, the user's instruction says to use the provided URLs. The resolution source is Binance's SOL/USDT pair. The search results don't have the exact candle data. Therefore, the correct answer is p4, but the user wants to avoid that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the data in [10] mentions a price of $112.50 at 10:00 AM, and later at 12:00 PM, it's $125.30. If the 1 PM ET candle (17:00 UTC) is after that, perhaps the price continued to fluctuate. But without explicit data, it's unclear. \n\nSince the user insists on not p4, but the data isn't available, perhaps the answer is p3 (50-50), but the ancillary data says p3 is 0.5, which is unknown. However, the resolution conditions have p3 as 0.5, but the market resolves to p1 or p2. \n\nWait, the resolution_conditions are p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: 0.5. The user's instruction says if no info, assume most probable. But without data, it's impossible. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4. But the user says to try again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the close price is available in the search results. Let me check again. Search result [10] says as of 10:00 AM UTC, SOL was $112.50. At 12:00 PM UTC, it was $125.30. The 1-hour candle at 17:00 UTC would be from 16:00 to 17:00 UTC. If the price at 16:00 was higher than 17:00, then close < open. But without data, it's impossible. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit data, the only correct answer is p4. But the user wants to avoid that. However, according to the instructions, if the event has occurred but no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. If the market was in a downtrend, maybe p1. But this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, looking at [11], the Solana price on Bitget is $147.55, but that's a different exchange. The user specified Binance. \n\nGiven the conflict and lack of explicit data, the recommendation remains p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750270344 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-18 18:12:24 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on whether the SOL/USDT 1-hour candle on June 18, 1 PM ET closed up or down. The resolution depends on Binance's data for that specific candle.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The given timestamp is 2025-06-18 18:12:24 UTC. The event in question is June 18, 1 PM ET, which is 17:00 UTC. Since the current time is 18:12 UTC, the candle in question (1 PM ET) has already closed. So the event has occurred, and we need to determine the outcome.\n\nNext, I should look at the provided search results to find the relevant data. Search result [10] mentions that as of 10:00 AM UTC on June 18, SOL was trading at $112.50 on Binance, but that's earlier in the day. However, the key is the 1-hour candle starting at 1 PM ET (17:00 UTC). \n\nLooking at search result [5], there's a TradingView idea from June 13, 2025, discussing SOL/USDT price levels. But that's a few days prior. Search result [10] also includes a flash news from June 18, 2025, stating that SOL's price dropped 7.2% within 24 hours, trading around $112.50 at 10:00 AM UTC. However, this is before the 1 PM ET candle.\n\nSearch result [11] from Bitget's analysis as of June 18, 2025, mentions SOL trading at $147.55, but this might be a different pair or a discrepancy. Need to cross-verify. Wait, the user specified SOL/USDT on Binance, so I should focus on Binance data.\n\nSearch result [10] also includes technical indicators: SOL breached the 50-day moving average of $125.30 at 12:00 PM UTC, RSI at 28.4 (oversold). However, the 1 PM ET candle is at 17:00 UTC. The price at 12:00 PM UTC is $112.50, but we need the 17:00 UTC candle.\n\nSearch result [4] and [8] provide historical data tables. Let's check [4]: SOL/USDC on BitMart, but the user specified Binance's SOL/USDT. [8] is Solana's historical data, but the source isn't specified. The latest entry in [8] is 144.161, but the date isn't clear. \n\nWait, search result [10] has a FAQ section updated on June 18, 2025, mentioning SOL's price at $112.50 at 10:00 AM UTC. Later, at 12:00 PM UTC, the price was around $125.30. However, the 1 PM ET (17:00 UTC) candle's open and close prices aren't directly provided. \n\nSince the search results don't explicitly state the open and close for the specific 1-hour candle, I might need to infer. If the price was $112.50 at 10:00 AM and $147.55 later (from [11]), but that's conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the data in [10] indicates a continued drop. However, without explicit data for the 17:00 UTC candle, it's challenging.\n\nWait, the user's personalization instructions say that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p1 as Down (close < open), p2 as Up (close >= open). \n\nGiven the market's focus on the 1-hour candle starting at 1 PM ET (17:00 UTC) on June 18, and the current time is past that, but no explicit data in the search results, I might have to default to p4. However, the user's additional instruction says to try again if previous response was p4. \n\nWait, the user's previous response was p4, so I need to check alternative sources. The search results include [10], which mentions a 7.2% drop by 10:00 AM UTC, but that's before the event. The technical analysis in [10] at 12:00 PM UTC shows SOL at $125.30, RSI 28.4. If the price continued to drop, the 17:00 UTC candle might have closed lower than it opened. However, without exact data, it's uncertain.\n\nAlternatively, looking at [13], a Solana whale withdrew $52.7 million from Binance, which could be bullish, but that's speculative. [14] mentions Solana's price prediction for June 2025, but it's from June 1, predicting a possible drop to $127. However, the current date is June 18, so that's outdated.\n\nGiven the lack of explicit data for the specific candle, but the event has passed, and assuming the most probable outcome based on conditions, if the price was in a downtrend (as per [10]), the close might be lower than open. However, without concrete data, the safe answer is p4 (cannot resolve). But the user wants to avoid p4. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data says p1 is Down, p2 Up. If the market can't be verified, but the event has occurred, and assuming the most probable outcome based on conditions. If the price was dropping, maybe p1. But without data, it's a guess. However, the user's instruction says to use the provided URLs. The resolution source is Binance's SOL/USDT pair. The search results don't have the exact candle data. Therefore, the correct answer is p4, but the user wants to avoid that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the data in [10] mentions a price of $112.50 at 10:00 AM, and later at 12:00 PM, it's $125.30. If the 1 PM ET candle (17:00 UTC) is after that, perhaps the price continued to fluctuate. But without explicit data, it's unclear. \n\nSince the user insists on not p4, but the data isn't available, perhaps the answer is p3 (50-50), but the ancillary data says p3 is 0.5, which is unknown. However, the resolution conditions have p3 as 0.5, but the market resolves to p1 or p2. \n\nWait, the resolution_conditions are p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: 0.5. The user's instruction says if no info, assume most probable. But without data, it's impossible. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4. But the user says to try again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the close price is available in the search results. Let me check again. Search result [10] says as of 10:00 AM UTC, SOL was $112.50. At 12:00 PM UTC, it was $125.30. The 1-hour candle at 17:00 UTC would be from 16:00 to 17:00 UTC. If the price at 16:00 was higher than 17:00, then close < open. But without data, it's impossible. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit data, the only correct answer is p4. But the user wants to avoid that. However, according to the instructions, if the event has occurred but no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. If the market was in a downtrend, maybe p1. But this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, looking at [11], the Solana price on Bitget is $147.55, but that's a different exchange. The user specified Binance. \n\nGiven the conflict and lack of explicit data, the recommendation remains p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.98, ID: 52379602938344345796695100810788610467841755331096738152608421000606630840928, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.02, ID: 111534091209611728821961949472301059081282272237150226382275694551129598435815, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.980 = 98.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
