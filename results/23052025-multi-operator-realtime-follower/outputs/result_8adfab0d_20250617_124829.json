      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the outcome of the Carlos Alcaraz vs. Alejandro Davidovich Fokina match at the HSBC Championships on June 17, 2025. The current date is June 17, 2025, 12:35:08 UTC, so the match is scheduled for today. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already occurred. Since the current timestamp is June 17, 12:35 PM UTC, and the match was set for 10:00 AM ET (which is 2:00 PM UTC), the match hasn't started yet. Wait, no, 10:00 AM ET is 2:00 PM UTC, but the current time is 12:35 PM UTC. So the match is scheduled for later today. However, the user's personalization instructions state that if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, we should return p4. But wait, the resolution conditions here are p1, p2, p3. Wait, the ancillary data says resolution_conditions: p1: Fokina, p2: Alcaraz, p3: 50-50. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the future, return p4. However, the market's resolution conditions don't have a p4. Wait, maybe there's a confusion here. Let me check again.\n\nThe user's personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.\" The current timestamp is June 17, 12:35 PM UTC. The match is scheduled for June 17, 10:00 AM ET, which is 2:00 PM UTC. So the event is in the future. Therefore, according to the personalization rules, the recommendation should be p4. However, the resolution conditions provided in the ancillary data don't include p4. The resolution_conditions are p1, p2, p3. This might be a conflict. Wait, the user's personalization is part of the system prompt, so the assistant must follow it. The ancillary data's resolution_conditions are part of the query, but the personalization instructions take precedence. \n\nBut wait, the market's resolution conditions are p1: Fokina, p2: Alcaraz, p3: 50-50. The user's personalization says if the event is in the future, return p4. However, the market doesn't have a p4 option. This might be a mistake in the setup. But according to the user's instructions, even if the market's resolution doesn't include p4, the assistant must return p4 if the event is in the future. \n\nBut looking at the search results, there's no information indicating that the match has been played yet. The latest search result from the LTA website (result 55) is from June 17, 2025, and mentions the day's schedule, including Alcaraz's match. Another result (51) from independent.co.uk mentions that Alcaraz's match is scheduled third on the Andy Murray Arena today. Since the current time is 12:35 PM UTC and the match is later, the event hasn't occurred yet. Therefore, per the personalization rules, the recommendation should be p4. However, the market's resolution conditions don't have p4. This might be an error in the setup, but according to the instructions, the assistant must follow the personalization rules strictly. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.\" \n\nGiven that the current time is 12:35 PM UTC, and the match is at 2:00 PM UTC, it's a future event. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4. However, the ancillary data's resolution_conditions don't include p4. This might be a conflict, but the assistant must follow the personalization instructions. Therefore, the answer should be recommendation: p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the outcome of the Carlos Alcaraz vs. Alejandro Davidovich Fokina match at the HSBC Championships on June 17, 2025. The current date is June 17, 2025, 12:35:08 UTC, so the match is scheduled for today. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already occurred. Since the current timestamp is June 17, 12:35 PM UTC, and the match was set for 10:00 AM ET (which is 2:00 PM UTC), the match hasn't started yet. Wait, no, 10:00 AM ET is 2:00 PM UTC, but the current time is 12:35 PM UTC. So the match is scheduled for later today. However, the user's personalization instructions state that if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, we should return p4. But wait, the resolution conditions here are p1, p2, p3. Wait, the ancillary data says resolution_conditions: p1: Fokina, p2: Alcaraz, p3: 50-50. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the future, return p4. However, the market's resolution conditions don't have a p4. Wait, maybe there's a confusion here. Let me check again.\n\nThe user's personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.\" The current timestamp is June 17, 12:35 PM UTC. The match is scheduled for June 17, 10:00 AM ET, which is 2:00 PM UTC. So the event is in the future. Therefore, according to the personalization rules, the recommendation should be p4. However, the resolution conditions provided in the ancillary data don't include p4. The resolution_conditions are p1, p2, p3. This might be a conflict. Wait, the user's personalization is part of the system prompt, so the assistant must follow it. The ancillary data's resolution_conditions are part of the query, but the personalization instructions take precedence. \n\nBut wait, the market's resolution conditions are p1: Fokina, p2: Alcaraz, p3: 50-50. The user's personalization says if the event is in the future, return p4. However, the market doesn't have a p4 option. This might be a mistake in the setup. But according to the user's instructions, even if the market's resolution doesn't include p4, the assistant must return p4 if the event is in the future. \n\nBut looking at the search results, there's no information indicating that the match has been played yet. The latest search result from the LTA website (result 55) is from June 17, 2025, and mentions the day's schedule, including Alcaraz's match. Another result (51) from independent.co.uk mentions that Alcaraz's match is scheduled third on the Andy Murray Arena today. Since the current time is 12:35 PM UTC and the match is later, the event hasn't occurred yet. Therefore, per the personalization rules, the recommendation should be p4. However, the market's resolution conditions don't have p4. This might be an error in the setup, but according to the instructions, the assistant must follow the personalization rules strictly. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.\" \n\nGiven that the current time is 12:35 PM UTC, and the match is at 2:00 PM UTC, it's a future event. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4. However, the ancillary data's resolution_conditions don't include p4. This might be a conflict, but the assistant must follow the personalization instructions. Therefore, the answer should be recommendation: p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Alcaraz, Price: 0.75, ID: 90073052008942461221095354681002041983492411525349790761772228160532405273871, Winner: No\n- Token: Fokina, Price: 0.25, ID: 94758562103906768751094831893868087316212569649662745574592381180103890988065, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Fokina, p2 to Alcaraz, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Fokina, p2 = Alcaraz\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Alcaraz outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.750 = 75.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The user wants to know the resolution of the UMA optimistic oracle request for the HSBC Championships match between Carlos Alcaraz and Alejandro Davidovich Fokina. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Alcaraz\" if he advances, \"Fokina\" if he does, and 50-50 if it's a tie, canceled, or delayed beyond June 24, 2025. The primary source is the LTA's HSBC Championships page, but credible reporting can also be used.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The user provided the current Unix timestamp as 1750163708, which converts to June 17, 2025, 12:35:08 UTC. The match is scheduled for June 17, 2025, at 10:00 AM ET, which is 14:00 UTC. Since the current time is 12:35 UTC, the match hasn't started yet. However, the user's previous response was p4, indicating the request couldn't be resolved. The user is asking to try again with a different approach or check alternative data sources.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's a lot of information. The match is part of the HSBC Championships, an ATP 500 event on grass. Alcaraz is the top seed, coming off a French Open win, while Davidovich Fokina is ranked 28th. Their head-to-head is 2-0 in favor of Alcaraz, with their last meeting in Monte Carlo in April 2025, which Alcaraz won in straight sets. The prediction from multiple sources (Sportskeeda, Tennis Tonic, etc.) is that Alcaraz will win in two tight sets. The odds are heavily in Alcaraz's favor (1.063 vs. 8.9 for Fokina).\n\nHowever, the user's previous response was p4, which suggests the assistant couldn't resolve it. But according to the instructions, if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, it's a future event and should return p4. But in this case, the current time is June 17, 2025, 12:35 UTC, and the match is scheduled for 14:00 UTC on the same day. Since it's the same day but later, it's still a future event. Therefore, the correct resolution should be p4.\n\nBut wait, the user's ancillary data says if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, return p4. Since the match is on June 17, 2025, at 14:00 UTC, and the current time is 12:35 UTC, it's still in the future. Therefore, the assistant should return p4. However, the user's previous response was p4, and they want to try again. Maybe there's a misunderstanding. Let me check the search results again.\n\nLooking at the search results, some sources mention the match is scheduled for June 17, 2025, but there's no mention of cancellation or postponement. The LTA's HSBC Championships page (search result 6, 11, 33, 48) doesn't indicate any cancellation. The match is listed as part of the first-round matches on June 17. Therefore, the match is still on as scheduled. However, since it's the same day but later, it's a future event, so the assistant should return p4. But the user wants to resolve it based on the provided data. Wait, the user's ancillary data says if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, return p4. Since the current time is 12:35 UTC and the match is at 14:00 UTC, it's still future. Therefore, the correct resolution is p4. However, the user might expect the assistant to infer the outcome based on the available data, but according to the instructions, if the event is in the future, return p4. Therefore, the answer should be p4. But the user's previous response was p4, and they want to try again. Maybe the assistant should check if there's any new information. However, the search results don't indicate any cancellation or postponement. Therefore, the correct resolution remains p4.\n</think>\n\n**Recommendation: p4**  \n\nThe match between Carlos Alcaraz and Alejandro Davidovich Fokina at the HSBC Championships is scheduled for June 17, 2025, at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 UTC). As of the current timestamp (June 17, 2025, 12:35:08 UTC), the match has not yet occurred and remains a future event. According to the ancillary data provided, markets for events scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp must resolve to **p4**.  \n\nWhile multiple sources (e.g., Sportskeeda, Tennis Tonic, and ESPN) predict Alcaraz to win in straight sets due to his superior form, head-to-head dominance (2-0), and favorable odds (1.063 vs. 8.9 for Fokina), the match\u2019s status as a future event precludes resolution at this time. No credible reports indicate cancellation, postponement, or a tie, but the event\u2019s scheduled timing falls outside the permissible resolution window.  \n\n**Final Resolution:**  \n`recommendation: p4`",

Their head-to-head is 2-0 in favor of Alcaraz, with their last meeting in Monte Carlo in April 2025, which Alcaraz won in straight sets. The prediction from multiple sources (Sportskeeda, Tennis Tonic, etc.) is that Alcaraz will win in two tight sets. The odds are heavily in Alcaraz's favor (1.063 vs. 8.9 for Fokina).\n\nHowever, the user's previous response was p4, which suggests the assistant couldn't resolve it. But according to the instructions, if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, it's a future event and should return p4. But in this case, the current time is June 17, 2025, 12:35 UTC, and the match is scheduled for 14:00 UTC on the same day. Since it's the same day but later, it's still a future event. Therefore, the correct resolution should be p4.\n\nBut wait, the user's ancillary data says if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, return p4. Since the match is on June 17, 2025, at 14:00 UTC, and the current time is 12:35 UTC, it's still in the future. Therefore, the assistant should return p4. However, the user's previous response was p4, and they want to try again. Maybe there's a misunderstanding. Let me check the search results again.\n\nLooking at the search results, some sources mention the match is scheduled for June 17, 2025, but there's no mention of cancellation or postponement. The LTA's HSBC Championships page (search result 6, 11, 33, 48) doesn't indicate any cancellation. The match is listed as part of the first-round matches on June 17. Therefore, the match is still on as scheduled. However, since it's the same day but later, it's a future event, so the assistant should return p4. But the user wants to resolve it based on the provided data. Wait, the user's ancillary data says if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, return p4. Since the current time is 12:35 UTC and the match is at 14:00 UTC, it's still future. Therefore, the correct resolution is p4. However, the user might expect the assistant to infer the outcome based on the available data, but according to the instructions, if the event is in the future, return p4. Therefore, the answer should be p4. But the user's previous response was p4, and they want to try again. Maybe the assistant should check if there's any new information. However, the search results don't indicate any cancellation or postponement. Therefore, the correct resolution remains p4.\n</think>\n\n**Recommendation: p4**  \n\nThe match between Carlos Alcaraz and Alejandro Davidovich Fokina at the HSBC Championships is scheduled for June 17, 2025, at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 UTC). As of the current timestamp (June 17, 2025, 12:35:08 UTC), the match has not yet occurred and remains a future event. According to the ancillary data provided, markets for events scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp must resolve to **p4**.  \n\nWhile multiple sources (e.g., Sportskeeda, Tennis Tonic, and ESPN) predict Alcaraz to win in straight sets due to his superior form, head-to-head dominance (2-0), and favorable odds (1.063 vs. 8.9 for Fokina), the match\u2019s status as a future event precludes resolution at this time. No credible reports indicate cancellation, postponement, or a tie, but the event\u2019s scheduled timing falls outside the permissible resolution window.  \n\n**Final Resolution:**  \n`recommendation: p4`\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Alcaraz, Price: 0.75, ID: 90073052008942461221095354681002041983492411525349790761772228160532405273871, Winner: No\n- Token: Fokina, Price: 0.25, ID: 94758562103906768751094831893868087316212569649662745574592381180103890988065, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Fokina, p2 to Alcaraz, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Fokina, p2 = Alcaraz\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Alcaraz outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.750 = 75.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on whether Carlos Alcaraz or Alejandro Davidovich Fokina wins their first-round match at the HSBC Championships on June 17, 2025. The current date is June 17, 2025, 12:35 PM UTC, so the match was scheduled for today at 10:00 AM ET, which is 2:00 PM UTC. Since it's already past that time, I need to check if the match happened and what the result was.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the provided search results. The key sources here are the LTA.org.uk pages and ATP Tour articles. From search result [3], the LTA's HSBC Championships 2025 results page updated on June 17 mentions highlights from day one, including Dan Evans and Jacob Fearnley's wins, and Cam Norrie's loss. However, there's no mention of Alcaraz vs. Davidovich Fokina in the day one results. \n\nSearch result [7] from ESPN and [8] from ATP Tour both indicate that the match was scheduled for June 17. The ATP article [8] specifically states that Alcaraz's first match is against Davidovich Fokina. However, the LTA's results page [3] doesn't list this match in the day one highlights, which might mean the match hasn't been played yet or the results aren't updated. \n\nLooking at the event schedule in search result [16], the ATP media notes for day 1 (June 16) and day 2 (June 17) list the order of play. The match between Alcaraz and Davidovich Fokina is scheduled for June 17 on Andy Murray Arena. Since the current time is June 17, 12:35 PM UTC, and the match was set for 10:00 AM ET (2:00 PM UTC), it's possible the match is yet to occur or is ongoing. However, the LTA's results page [3] was updated on June 17 but doesn't mention this match, which is confusing. \n\nThere's a possibility that the match was delayed or the results haven't been posted yet. The user's ancillary data states that if the match is delayed beyond June 24, it resolves to 50-50. But since today is June 17, the delay clause isn't triggered yet. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit results in the provided sources and the current timestamp, it's unclear if the match has concluded. However, the user's previous response was p4, which is the 50-50 outcome. The user is asking to try again, so I need to check if any other sources in the search results provide the outcome. \n\nSearch result [15] from 2024 is irrelevant. The other sources [7], [8], [11], [12], [13], [14] discuss the upcoming match and predictions but don't provide the result. Since there's no confirmation of the match result in the provided search results, and the official LTA page [3] hasn't updated it, the resolution should default to p4 as per the instructions: if no verifiable information is available and the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. However, the user's ancillary data says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nAlcaraz is the heavy favorite, with a 2-0 H2H record, and all predictions favor him. But without official confirmation, the resolution should be p4. However, the user's previous response was p4, and they want a different approach. Maybe the match was played, and the result is in another source. Let me check again. \n\nWait, search result [3] mentions \"Day one: Evans & Fearnley into second round; Norrie exits in first round defeat\" on June 17. The Alcaraz match might be part of day one, but it's not listed. The order of play in [6] (ESPN) shows Round 1 matches on June 16 and 17. The exact timing isn't clear, but if the match was scheduled for June 17 at 10 AM ET, which is 2 PM UTC, and the current time is 12:35 PM UTC, the match hasn't happened yet. Therefore, it's a future event, and per the user's instructions, if the event is scheduled for the same day but a later time, it's still future. Hence, the resolution should be p4. \n\nBut the user says the current timestamp is June 17, 12:35 PM UTC, and the match was at 10 AM ET (2 PM UTC). So the match is in the future. Therefore, the correct resolution is p4. However, the user's previous response was p4, and they want to check again. Maybe the match was played earlier? Let me check the time zones again. 10 AM ET is 2 PM UTC. The current time is 12:35 PM UTC, so the match is in 1.5 hours. Therefore, it's a future event, and the resolution should be p4. \n\nBut the user's personalization says if the event is scheduled for the same day but later time, it's still future. Therefore, the answer remains p4. However, the user wants to try again. Maybe the match was played earlier due to scheduling changes? The search results don't indicate any changes. Therefore, the correct resolution is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750163708 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-17 12:35:08 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4.

First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: HSBC Championships: Alcaraz vs. Davidovich Fokina, description: Carlos Alcaraz and Alejandro Davidovich Fokina are scheduled to play each other in a Round 1 matchup in the HSBC Championships mens singles tournament on June 17, 2025, at 10:00 AM ET. \n\nThis market will resolve to \"Alcaraz\" if Carlos Alcaraz advances against Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in Round 1 of the HSBC Championships mens singles tournament.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Fokina\" if Alejandro Davidovich Fokina advances against Carlos Alcaraz in Round 1 of the HSBC Championships mens singles tournament.\n\nIf the match ends in a tie, is canceled, or delayed beyond June 24, 2025, this market will resolve to 50-50.\n\nThe primary resolution source will be official information from the HSBC Championships (https://www.lta.org.uk/fan-zone/international/hsbc-championships/), however, a consensus of credible reporting may also be used.\n\n market_id: 552985\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Fokina, p2 to Alcaraz, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750163708 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-17 12:35:08 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\n# Load environment variables\nload_dotenv()\nAPI_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\")\nif not API_KEY:\n    raise ValueError(\"Missing SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\")\n\n# Constants\nPRIMARY_ENDPOINT = \"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nhl\"\nPROXY_ENDPOINT = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/nhl-proxy\"\nHEADERS = {\"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key\": API_KEY}\nRESOLUTION_MAP = {\n    \"ALC\": \"p2\",  # Alcaraz\n    \"FOK\": \"p1\",  # Fokina\n    \"50-50\": \"p3\",\n    \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\",\n}\n\n# Helper functions\ndef get_data(url, headers):\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        return response.json()\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error fetching data: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef resolve_match(date_str, player1, player2):\n    # Format the date for API request\n    date_formatted = datetime.strptime(date_str, \"%Y-%m-%d\").strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n    url = f\"{PRIMARY_ENDPOINT}/scores/json/GamesByDate/{date_formatted}\"\n\n    # Try proxy endpoint first\n    games = get_data(PROXY_ENDPOINT + url, HEADERS)\n    if games is None:\n        # Fallback to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n        games = get_data(url, HEADERS)\n\n    if games:\n        for game in games:\n            if {game[\"HomeTeam\"], game[\"AwayTeam\"]} == {player1, player2}:\n                if game[\"Status\"] == \"Final\":\n                    winner = game[\"HomeTeam\"] if game[\"HomeTeamRuns\"] > game[\"AwayTeamRuns\"] else game[\"AwayTeam\"]\n                    return RESOLUTION_MAP.get(winner, \"p4\")\n                elif game[\"Status\"] in [\"Canceled\", \"Postponed\"]:\n                    return \"p3\"\n                else:\n                    return \"p4\"\n    return \"p4\"\n\n# Main execution\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Match details\n    match_date = \"2025-06-17\"\n    player1 = \"ALC\"  # Alcaraz\n    player2 = \"FOK\"  # Fokina\n\n    # Resolve the match and print the recommendation\n    recommendation = resolve_match(match_date, player1, player2)\n    print(f\"recommendation: {recommendation}\")\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nError fetching data: 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/nhl-proxyhttps://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nhl/scores/json/GamesByDate/2025-06-17\nError fetching data: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nhl/scores/json/GamesByDate/2025-06-17\nrecommendation: p4\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Where p1 corresponds to Fokina, p2 to Alcaraz, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Fokina, p2 = Alcaraz\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Alcaraz outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.750 = 75.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Query Type Specific Information:\n\n\n6. NEVER include actual API key values in the code, always load them from environment variables.\n\n7. IMPORTANT FOR ALL DATA SOURCES: If a proxy endpoint is provided alongside a primary endpoint, you MUST implement the fallback mechanism described above. This is critical for reliability:\n   - Always try the proxy endpoint first\n   - If the proxy fails, fall back to the primary endpoint\n   - Use appropriate timeout values (10 seconds recommended)\n   - Include proper error handling with try/except blocks\n\nThe code should be completely self-contained and runnable with no arguments.\n\n\nHere's a complete code example that shows how to solve this type of problem:\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nMLB market resolver\np1 = Texas Rangers\np2 = Oakland Athletics\np3 = 50-50 (canceled / tie)\np4 = Too early / in-progress\n\"\"\"\nimport os, time, logging, re, requests\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\n# \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 configuration \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nload_dotenv()\nAPI_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\nif not API_KEY:\n    raise ValueError(\"Missing SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\nHEADERS = {\"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key\": API_KEY}\n\nlogging.basicConfig(\n    level=logging.DEBUG,\n    format=\"%(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] %(message)s\",\n    handlers=[logging.StreamHandler()])\nlogging.getLogger().addFilter(\n    lambda r: setattr(r, \"msg\",\n        re.sub(re.escape(API_KEY), \"******\", r.getMessage())) or True)\nlog = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n# \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 generic GET wrapper \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\ndef _get(url, tag, retries=3, backoff=1.5):\n    for i in range(retries):\n        log.debug(f\"[{tag}] \u2192 {url}\")\n        r = requests.get(url, headers=HEADERS, timeout=10)\n        log.debug(f\"[{tag}] \u2190 {r.status_code} {r.reason}\")\n        if r.ok:\n            log.debug(f\"[{tag}] payload length: {len(r.json())}\")\n            return r.json()\n        if r.status_code in (401, 403):\n            log.error(f\"[{tag}] blocked \u2014 not in plan\");

Where p1 corresponds to Fokina, p2 to Alcaraz, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date.

Recommendation found: p4.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p4\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Alcaraz, Price: 0.75, ID: 90073052008942461221095354681002041983492411525349790761772228160532405273871, Winner: No\n- Token: Fokina, Price: 0.25, ID: 94758562103906768751094831893868087316212569649662745574592381180103890988065, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Fokina, p2 to Alcaraz, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Fokina, p2 = Alcaraz\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Alcaraz outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.750 = 75.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Removing all command-line argument handling\n2. Using dotenv to load API keys from environment variables\n3. Extracting required info (dates, teams, etc.) directly from the question\n4. Making the code runnable with no arguments\n5. Handling errors gracefully\n6. Returning results in a clear format (either JSON or plaintext with a 'recommendation: X' line)\n\nFor NHL hockey data:\n- Use Sports Data IO API with the SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY from environment variables\n- Use python-dotenv to load the API key:\n  ```python\n  from dotenv import load_dotenv\n  import os\n  \n  load_dotenv()\n  api_key = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\")\n  ```\n- Extract team names and dates from the question\n- The team abbreviations for NHL are:\n  * Seattle Kraken = SEA\n  * Vegas Golden Knights = VGK\n  * Toronto Maple Leafs = TOR\n  * Boston Bruins = BOS\n  * And other standard NHL team abbreviations\n- CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: When defining RESOLUTION_MAP, you MUST use team abbreviations (not full names) as keys:\n  ```python\n  # CORRECT - Use team abbreviations as keys\n  RESOLUTION_MAP = {\n      \"VGK\": \"p1\",  # Golden Knights\n      \"SEA\": \"p2\",  # Kraken\n      \"50-50\": \"p3\",\n      \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\",\n  }\n  \n  # WRONG - Do NOT use full team names as keys\n  # RESOLUTION_MAP = {\n  #     \"Golden Knights\": \"p1\",  # Wrong!

Where p1 corresponds to Fokina, p2 to Alcaraz, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750163708 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-17 12:35:08 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Revise the API endpoint to fetch data relevant to tennis matches, specifically from sources that cover the HSBC Championships.

Where p1 corresponds to Fokina, p2 to Alcaraz, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Fokina, p2 = Alcaraz\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Alcaraz outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.750 = 75.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Where p1 corresponds to Fokina, p2 to Alcaraz, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750163708 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-17 12:35:08 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Revise the API endpoint to fetch data relevant to tennis matches, specifically from sources that cover the HSBC Championships. Ensure the logic correctly interprets tennis match outcomes and aligns with the event specifics provided in the user prompt.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Revise the API endpoint to correctly target tennis match data, specifically from sources covering the HSBC Championships. Ensure the logic accurately interprets match outcomes, player names, and match statuses directly related to the query. Consider time zone differences in date and time handling.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Revise the API endpoint to correctly target tennis match data, specifically from sources covering the HSBC Championships.

Where p1 corresponds to Fokina, p2 to Alcaraz, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Fokina, p2 = Alcaraz\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Alcaraz outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.750 = 75.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

        "critique": "The response from the code_runner solver has several critical issues. Firstly, the API endpoint used is incorrect for the tennis match data required for the HSBC Championships. The code incorrectly targets a college basketball API endpoint, which is not relevant to the query. Secondly, the code execution resulted in a 401 Unauthorized error, indicating an issue with API access or credentials, which prevented data retrieval. Additionally, the default recommendation of 'p3' (50-50) does not align with the market sentiment, which moderately favors Alcaraz (p2). The code also lacks proper error handling and fallback mechanisms for data retrieval failures.",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750163708 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-17 12:35:08 UTC",
