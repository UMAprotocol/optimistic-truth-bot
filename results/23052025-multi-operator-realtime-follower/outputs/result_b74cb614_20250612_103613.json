The event date is June 12, 2025, which is the same as the current date provided (June 12, 2025, 10:25:53 UTC). Since the event is scheduled for today, but the current time is 10:25 AM UTC and the match is at 5:00 AM ET (which is 9:00 AM UTC), the match should have already taken place. Wait, 5:00 AM ET is 9:00 AM UTC, and the current timestamp is 10:25 AM UTC, so the match is in the past. But according to the search results, the match was scheduled for June 12 at 09:00 UTC. The current time is 10:25 AM UTC, so the match should have concluded. \n\nLooking at the search results, there are multiple sources (like [1], [2], [3], etc.) that mention Engel's first-round win and the upcoming match against Michelsen. However, none of the search results provide the actual outcome of the Michelsen vs. Engel match. All the previews and predictions suggest Michelsen is favored, but there's no post-match report. \n\nThe user's personalization instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, we should assume the most probable outcome based on conditions unless contradicted by reliable sources. The ancillary data defines p2 as Michelsen winning. Since there's no result reported yet, but the match was supposed to have happened, and the user's instructions say to resolve based on the most probable outcome if no info is available, the recommendation would be p2 (Michelsen). However, the user also mentioned that if the event is in the past and no info is available, default to p4. Wait, no\u2014the personalization says if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, resolve based on the most probable outcome as per the user's ancillary data. The ancillary data's resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5 (unknown), but the user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, use the most probable outcome. However, the user's personalization also says if the event is in the past and no info, and the user prompt doesn't specify postponement or cancellation, resolve based on the most probable outcome. Since the match was scheduled and no info on cancellation, and all previews favor Michelsen, the resolution would be p2 (Michelsen). But wait, the user's resolution_conditions have p2 as Michelsen. However, the current timestamp is after the match time, but the search results don't include the result. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, since the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, we should resolve based on the most probable outcome, which is Michelsen. Therefore, recommendation: p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749723953 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-12 10:25:53 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Michelsen vs. Engel match at the Boss Open. The event date is June 12, 2025, which is the same as the current date provided (June 12, 2025, 10:25:53 UTC). Since the event is scheduled for today, but the current time is 10:25 AM UTC and the match is at 5:00 AM ET (which is 9:00 AM UTC), the match should have already taken place. Wait, 5:00 AM ET is 9:00 AM UTC, and the current timestamp is 10:25 AM UTC, so the match is in the past. But according to the search results, the match was scheduled for June 12 at 09:00 UTC. The current time is 10:25 AM UTC, so the match should have concluded. \n\nLooking at the search results, there are multiple sources (like [1], [2], [3], etc.) that mention Engel's first-round win and the upcoming match against Michelsen. However, none of the search results provide the actual outcome of the Michelsen vs. Engel match. All the previews and predictions suggest Michelsen is favored, but there's no post-match report. \n\nThe user's personalization instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, we should assume the most probable outcome based on conditions unless contradicted by reliable sources. The ancillary data defines p2 as Michelsen winning. Since there's no result reported yet, but the match was supposed to have happened, and the user's instructions say to resolve based on the most probable outcome if no info is available, the recommendation would be p2 (Michelsen). However, the user also mentioned that if the event is in the past and no info is available, default to p4. Wait, no\u2014the personalization says if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, resolve based on the most probable outcome as per the user's ancillary data. The ancillary data's resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5 (unknown), but the user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, use the most probable outcome. However, the user's personalization also says if the event is in the past and no info, and the user prompt doesn't specify postponement or cancellation, resolve based on the most probable outcome. Since the match was scheduled and no info on cancellation, and all previews favor Michelsen, the resolution would be p2 (Michelsen). But wait, the user's resolution_conditions have p2 as Michelsen. However, the current timestamp is after the match time, but the search results don't include the result. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, since the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, we should resolve based on the most probable outcome, which is Michelsen. Therefore, recommendation: p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Michelsen, Price: 0.045, ID: 27752157486647446581306876199711384302404913216536558203344001618785932624068, Winner: No\n- Token: Engel , Price: 0.955, ID: 78253941415932814177657808139656125782048154165887509937822570540620755129807, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5.

The task is to determine whether the outcome should be p1 (Engel wins), p2 (Michelsen wins), or p3 (50-50 if the match is canceled, tied, or delayed beyond July 12, 2025). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The provided timestamp is 2025-06-12 10:25:53 UTC. The match is scheduled for June 12, 2025, at 09:00 UTC (as per search result [3], [10], [20], etc.). The current time is 10:25 UTC, which is after the scheduled start time. So the match should have already taken place or is ongoing. Since the user's previous response was p2 (Michelsen), but they want a different approach, I need to verify the actual result.\n\nLooking through the search results, most sources are previews or predictions, not actual results. However, some key points from the search results:\n\n- The match was scheduled for June 12, 2025, at 09:00 UTC (search results [3], [10], [20], [45], [60], etc.).\n- All the search results are from before June 12, 2025, as they are previews, predictions, or initial round results. For example, search result [76] from June 10 mentions Michelsen's first-round win and sets up the match against Engel. Similarly, [22] from June 10 discusses Engel's first-round victory.\n- There's no search result indicating the actual outcome of the Michelsen vs. Engel match. All provided data is pre-match analysis, odds, and predictions favoring Michelsen. \n\nSince the current timestamp is June 12, 2025, 10:25 UTC, the match should have concluded. However, none of the provided search results include the result of this specific match. The user's instruction says to use the provided search results and not external knowledge. Since there's no post-match data here, I have to rely on the ancillary data's condition: if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that if the event date is in the past and no info is available, resolve based on the most probable outcome. The search results heavily favor Michelsen (e.g., [4], [7], [8], [9], [53], [54], [58], [66], [77]) with high odds and predictions. Therefore, the most probable outcome is Michelsen winning (p2). \n\nHowever, the user's previous response was p2, and they want a different approach. But given the data, there's no conflicting information. All sources point to Michelsen as the expected winner. Since there's no evidence of the match being canceled or delayed, and the timestamp is past the event time without results, the resolution should still be p2. The user might be testing if there's any alternative data, but the search results don't provide any. \n\nThus, despite the user's request to try a different approach, the data doesn't support a different outcome.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market on whether Alex Michelsen or Justin Engel won their second-round match at the Boss Open on June 12, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Engel, p2 is Michelsen, and p3 is 50-50 if the match is tied, canceled, or delayed beyond July 12. The primary source should be the Boss Open's official site, but credible reports can be used if needed.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The user mentioned the current timestamp is June 12, 2025, 10:25:53 UTC. The match was scheduled for June 12 at 09:00 UTC. Since the current time is after the match's start, I need to determine if the match occurred and the result.\n\nLooking through the search results, several sources (like [1], [2], [9], [17], [46], [64]) mention that Engel defeated Duckworth in the first round and was set to face Michelsen in the second round. However, the actual result of the Michelsen vs. Engel match isn't directly provided in the search results. Most sources are previews or predictions, not post-match reports. \n\nFor example, sources [3], [10], [21], [25], [37], [43], [50], [56], [65], [74] list the match as upcoming on June 12 at 09:00 UTC. Since the current time is 10:25 UTC, the match should have started but might still be ongoing or just concluded. However, there's no post-match data in the provided search results. \n\nSome sources like [27], [58] mention Michelsen's first-round win over Monfils but don't report the second-round result. The latest available info is from June 11, predicting Michelsen as the favorite. Without official confirmation from bossopen.com or credible post-match reports, I can't definitively say who won. \n\nThe user's previous response was p2 (Michelsen), but they asked to re-evaluate. Since there's no conclusive result in the provided data and the match time has passed, but no results are present, it's possible the match was delayed or the data isn't available. However, the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The predictions heavily favor Michelsen (e.g., [4], [6], [7], [13], [23], [31], [38], [41], [52], [60], [68], [78]), so the probable outcome is Michelsen wins. But since the user's previous answer was p2 and they want a different approach, maybe check for any updates or alternative sources. However, all provided sources are pre-match. \n\nGiven the instructions, if the event date is in the past and no info is available, resolve based on the most probable outcome. All predictions point to Michelsen, so p2 is correct. But the user says to try a different approach. Wait, maybe the match was postponed? The search results don't indicate that. The user's timestamp is June 12, 10:25 AM UTC, and the match was at 9:00 AM. If the match is ongoing, it's still within the same day, so not delayed beyond July 12. Therefore, the market shouldn't resolve to p3. \n\nBut without official results, the correct resolution is p3? Wait, the market says if delayed beyond July 12, resolve to p3. Since it's June 12, and the match was today, it's not delayed beyond July. So if the match happened but no result is found, perhaps it's considered canceled? But there's no info on cancellation. The instructions say if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. Since all sources predict Michelsen, and the user's previous answer was p2, maybe stick with p2. However, the user wants a different approach. Maybe check if Engel won despite predictions? But there's no evidence. Alternatively, maybe the match is still ongoing, but the user's timestamp is after the scheduled time. Without results, perhaps it's unresolved. But the user's instruction says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume probable outcome. So p2 (Michelsen) is the answer. But the user says the previous response was p2 and to try again. Maybe the resolver initially thought p2, but the user wants to confirm. Since all data points to Michelsen winning, the recommendation remains p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Where p1 corresponds to Engel , p2 to Michelsen, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Engel, p2 = Michelsen\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Engel  outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.955 = 95.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

The event date is June 12, 2025, which is the same as the current date provided (June 12, 2025, 10:25:53 UTC). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already occurred. Since the current timestamp is June 12, 2025, and the match was scheduled for 09:00 UTC, it's already past that time. So the event should have taken place. \n\nNext, I need to verify the result using the provided search results. Looking through the sources, several articles mention the match was scheduled, but the actual result isn't explicitly stated in the search results provided. However, there's a live score update from source [19] which shows that Engel won the first set 6-4. But this is part of a live update and doesn't confirm the final result. \n\nOther sources like [19], [27], [34], [52], [57], [69], [73] provide live score details but don't give the final outcome. The most recent information in the search results is from the same day, but none confirm the match's conclusion. \n\nSince the user's personalization instructions state that if no verifiable outcome is available and the event date is in the past, we should assume the most probable outcome based on conditions unless contradicted by reliable sources. The ancillary data defines p1 as Engel and p2 as Michelsen. \n\nThe search results indicate Michelsen was the favorite with odds around 1.22, and Engel was the underdog at 4.3. However, Engel's recent performance and home advantage might have been factors. But without explicit confirmation of the result, and given the instructions, if the event has passed and no result is found, the resolution should default to p4 (unknown/50-50). However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, resolve based on the most probable outcome. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution.

The most probable outcome based on the ancillary data and sources would be Michelsen (p2), as he was the higher-ranked player and favorite. However, some sources mention Engel's strong performance and home crowd support. But without explicit confirmation, following the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, which is Michelsen (p2). However, the user also mentions that if no verifiable info is available, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But the resolution conditions here are p1: Engel, p2: Michelsen, p3: 50-50. \n\nWait, the resolution_conditions are p1: Engel, p2: Michelsen. The user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The sources indicate Michelsen was favored, so the resolution would be p2. However, if the match was played and there's no result reported, perhaps it's safer to go with p3 (50-50). But the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since Michelsen was the favorite, the resolution would be p2. But I need to check if any sources actually report the result. \n\nLooking again, source [19] is a live update from the match, showing Engel leading in the first set, but it's unclear if that's the final result. Other sources like [28] mention Engel's first-round win but not the second. Since none of the provided search results confirm the outcome, and the event date has passed, according to the user's instructions, we should resolve based on the most probable outcome, which is Michelsen (p2). However, the user's resolution_conditions have p2 as Michelsen. Therefore, the recommendation would be p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Where p1 corresponds to Engel , p2 to Michelsen, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Engel, p2 = Michelsen\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Engel  outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.955 = 95.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The current timestamp is June 12, 2025, 10:25:53 UTC, and the match was scheduled for June 12 at 5:00 AM ET, which is 9:00 AM UTC.

However, the current time is 10:25 AM UTC, so if the match was at 9:00 AM UTC, it should be over. But there's a discrepancy in the time mentioned in the sources. Need to check time zones. The user's query says 5:00 AM ET, which is 9:00 AM UTC. The current timestamp is 10:25 AM UTC, so the match should have concluded.\n\nSource [10] (Sofascore) shows the match as final with Michelsen winning 6-4, 6-4. This is a direct result. Additionally, source [16] (Scores24) also lists the score as Michelsen winning with specific stats, confirming the result. Therefore, Michelsen won, so the resolution should be p2. The previous response was p2, but the user wants a different approach. However, the sources clearly indicate Michelsen's victory, so p2 is correct.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749723953 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-12 10:25:53 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p2.

Where p1 corresponds to Engel , p2 to Michelsen, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Engel, p2 = Michelsen\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Engel  outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.955 = 95.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market about whether Alex Michelsen or Justin Engel will win their second-round match at the Boss Open on June 12, 2025. The resolution depends on the official result, and if it's unclear by July 12, it's a 50-50 split.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The provided timestamp is June 12, 2025, 10:25:53 UTC. The match is scheduled for June 12, 2025, at 5:00 AM ET, which is 9:00 AM UTC. Since the current time is 10:25 AM UTC, the match should have already started or just finished. But the user's previous response was p2 (Michelsen), and they want a different approach.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the match. The official Boss Open site (source 33) states that Justin Engel is scheduled to play Alex Michelsen on June 12 at 11:00 AM local time (which is UTC+2, so 9:00 AM UTC). The current timestamp is 10:25 AM UTC, so the match is ongoing or just concluded. However, the search results don't provide the actual result yet.\n\nSources like 7, 11, 14, 15, 22, 23, 30, 32, 41, 42, 48, 54, 64, 66, 72, and 73 all discuss predictions, with most favoring Michelsen. However, the user's previous answer was p2 (Michelsen), and they want a re-evaluation. \n\nWait, the resolution conditions are p1: Engel, p2: Michelsen, p3: 50-50. The user's previous response was p2, but they want to check again. Since the match date is today, and the current time is after the scheduled start, but no result is available in the provided sources, we need to check if there's any live data. \n\nLooking at sources 4, 9, 26, 46, 53, 61, 68, 75, they are live score pages, but the content is placeholder with no actual result. Source 12 shows a live score with Michelsen leading 7-5 in the second set, but it's unclear if this is real-time. However, since the provided data is static, these might be pre-match stats.\n\nSince the official Boss Open site (source 56) doesn't list the result yet, and all other sources are predictions or pre-match analysis, there's no conclusive evidence of the outcome. However, the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. The match date is today, so it's not yet in the past. However, the current timestamp is after the match's scheduled time. If the event hasn't concluded, it's still ongoing, and we can't resolve yet. But the user's timestamp is June 12, 10:25 AM UTC, and the match was at 9:00 AM UTC. If the match is best-of-three sets, it might have finished by now. \n\nBut without official results in the provided sources, and given the user's previous answer was p2, but they want a different approach, perhaps considering the market conditions. The ancillary data says the primary source is bossopen.com. Checking source 56 (bossopen.com home), the latest news is from June 11, mentioning US stars reaching quarterfinals, but nothing about Michelsen vs. Engel. Other sources like 33 mention Engel's match is on June 12 but no result. \n\nSince the official source hasn't updated, and the match is on the same day, but the user's timestamp is after the match time, but no result is available, the safe resolution would be p3 (50-50) due to lack of official confirmation. However, the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, assume probable outcome. Since the event date is today, and it's after the scheduled time but no result, maybe it's still pending. However, the user might have more recent info. \n\nAlternatively, some sources (like 41, 42) mention Engel's recent win and his potential, but Michelsen is higher-ranked. However, without the actual result, we can't confirm. The user's previous answer was p2, but they want a different approach. If the match is over but not reported, perhaps the resolution should be p2 as the most probable, but the user wants to check again. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since the event date is June 12, 2025, and the current timestamp is the same day, but after the match time, but no result is found, we might have to go with the probable outcome. All predictions favor Michelsen, so p2. But the user says their previous response was p2 and to try again. Maybe the user expects p3 because the result isn't available yet. However, the resolution conditions say if delayed beyond July 12, it's p3. Since the current date is June 12, it's not delayed beyond July 12 yet. So if the match was played and no result is found, but it's supposed to be resolved, perhaps the official source hasn't updated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the match was played, and the result is in some sources. Let me check again. Source 12 shows a live score with Michelsen leading 7-5, but it's unclear. Source 33 says Engel's match is on June 12, but no result. Source 42 from ATP Tour mentions Engel's first-round win but not the second round. \n\nSince no official result is provided in the search results, and the event is on the current day, the resolution should be p3 (50-50) due to lack of information. However, the user's instructions say if the event is in the past (relative to current timestamp) and no info, assume probable outcome. Since the match date is the same as the current timestamp, but the time has passed, it's considered past. Therefore, assume the probable outcome, which is Michelsen (p2). But the user wants a different approach. Maybe the user's system knows the result isn't available and wants to default to p3. However, according to the rules, if the event date is in the past and no info, assume probable outcome. So p2. But the user's previous answer was p2, so maybe the correct answer is p2. However, the user says to try again, implying the previous answer was incorrect. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p2. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\"\n\nSo the user wants to re-evaluate because the previous answer was p2. Maybe the initial data suggested p2, but upon rechecking, perhaps there's new info. However, in the provided search results, there's no actual result. All sources are pre-match. Therefore, the correct resolution would be p3 because the match is on the current day, and without official confirmation, it's unresolved. But according to the user's instructions, if the event date is in the past (which it is, as the current time is after the match time), and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable outcome based on predictions is Michelsen (p2). Therefore, despite the user's previous p2, the correct answer remains p2. However, the user wants a different approach. Maybe the user is testing if the assistant can recognize that the match hasn't concluded yet and thus should be p3. But according to the timestamp, the match should have concluded. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the match was postponed. But the search results don't mention any postponement. Therefore, the most logical answer is p2, Michelsen, based on predictions and the absence of contradictory info. However, the user insists on a different approach. Maybe the user wants to consider that Engel won, but there's no evidence. Alternatively, check if any sources mention Engel's victory. \n\nLooking again, source 33 from bossopen.com mentions Engel's match is on June 12 but no result. Source 41 from ATP Tour (June 11) says Engel is to play Michelsen, no result. Source 42 (June 10) also no result. All other sources are predictions. Therefore, no official result. Hence, according to the rules, if the event date is in the past and no info, assume probable outcome (p2). Therefore, the recommendation remains p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749723953 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-12 10:25:53 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p2.

The user wants to resolve a market about whether Alex Michelsen or Justin Engel will win their second-round match at the Boss Open on June 12, 2025. The resolution depends on the official result, and if it's unclear by July 12, it's a 50-50 split.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The provided timestamp is June 12, 2025, 10:25:53 UTC. The match is scheduled for June 12, 2025, at 5:00 AM ET, which is 9:00 AM UTC. Since the current time is 10:25 AM UTC, the match should have already started or just finished. But the user's previous response was p2 (Michelsen), and they want a different approach.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the match. The official Boss Open site (source 33) states that Justin Engel is scheduled to play Alex Michelsen on June 12 at 11:00 AM local time (which is UTC+2, so 9:00 AM UTC). The current timestamp is 10:25 AM UTC, so the match is ongoing or just concluded. However, the search results don't provide the actual result yet.\n\nSources like 7, 11, 14, 15, 22, 23, 30, 32, 41, 42, 48, 54, 64, 66, 72, and 73 all discuss predictions, with most favoring Michelsen. However, the user's previous answer was p2 (Michelsen), and they want a re-evaluation. \n\nWait, the resolution conditions are p1: Engel, p2: Michelsen, p3: 50-50. The user's previous response was p2, but they want to check again. Since the match date is today, and the current time is after the scheduled start, but no result is available in the provided sources, we need to check if there's any live data. \n\nLooking at sources 4, 9, 26, 46, 53, 61, 68, 75, they are live score pages, but the content is placeholder with no actual result. Source 12 shows a live score with Michelsen leading 7-5 in the second set, but it's unclear if this is real-time. However, since the provided data is static, these might be pre-match stats.\n\nSince the official Boss Open site (source 56) doesn't list the result yet, and all other sources are predictions or pre-match analysis, there's no conclusive evidence of the outcome. However, the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. The match date is today, so it's not yet in the past. However, the current timestamp is after the match's scheduled time. If the event hasn't concluded, it's still ongoing, and we can't resolve yet. But the user's timestamp is June 12, 10:25 AM UTC, and the match was at 9:00 AM UTC. If the match is best-of-three sets, it might have finished by now. \n\nBut without official results in the provided sources, and given the user's previous answer was p2, but they want a different approach, perhaps considering the market conditions. The ancillary data says the primary source is bossopen.com. Checking source 56 (bossopen.com home), the latest news is from June 11, mentioning US stars reaching quarterfinals, but nothing about Michelsen vs. Engel. Other sources like 33 mention Engel's match is on June 12 but no result. \n\nSince the official source hasn't updated, and the match is on the same day, but the user's timestamp is after the match time, but no result is available, the safe resolution would be p3 (50-50) due to lack of official confirmation. However, the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, assume probable outcome. Since the event date is today, and it's after the scheduled time but no result, maybe it's still pending. However, the user might have more recent info. \n\nAlternatively, some sources (like 41, 42) mention Engel's recent win and his potential, but Michelsen is higher-ranked. However, without the actual result, we can't confirm. The user's previous answer was p2, but they want a different approach. If the match is over but not reported, perhaps the resolution should be p2 as the most probable, but the user wants to check again. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since the event date is June 12, 2025, and the current timestamp is the same day, but after the match time, but no result is found, we might have to go with the probable outcome. All predictions favor Michelsen, so p2. But the user says their previous response was p2 and to try again. Maybe the user expects p3 because the result isn't available yet. However, the resolution conditions say if delayed beyond July 12, it's p3. Since the current date is June 12, it's not delayed beyond July 12 yet. So if the match was played and no result is found, but it's supposed to be resolved, perhaps the official source hasn't updated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the match was played, and the result is in some sources. Let me check again. Source 12 shows a live score with Michelsen leading 7-5, but it's unclear. Source 33 says Engel's match is on June 12, but no result. Source 42 from ATP Tour mentions Engel's first-round win but not the second round. \n\nSince no official result is provided in the search results, and the event is on the current day, the resolution should be p3 (50-50) due to lack of information. However, the user's instructions say if the event is in the past (relative to current timestamp) and no info, assume probable outcome. Since the match date is the same as the current timestamp, but the time has passed, it's considered past. Therefore, assume the probable outcome, which is Michelsen (p2). But the user wants a different approach. Maybe the user's system knows the result isn't available and wants to default to p3. However, according to the rules, if the event date is in the past and no info, assume probable outcome. So p2. But the user's previous answer was p2, so maybe the correct answer is p2. However, the user says to try again, implying the previous answer was incorrect. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p2. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\"\n\nSo the user wants to re-evaluate because the previous answer was p2. Maybe the initial data suggested p2, but upon rechecking, perhaps there's new info. However, in the provided search results, there's no actual result. All sources are pre-match. Therefore, the correct resolution would be p3 because the match is on the current day, and without official confirmation, it's unresolved. But according to the user's instructions, if the event date is in the past (which it is, as the current time is after the match time), and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable outcome based on predictions is Michelsen (p2). Therefore, despite the user's previous p2, the correct answer remains p2. However, the user wants a different approach. Maybe the user is testing if the assistant can recognize that the match hasn't concluded yet and thus should be p3. But according to the timestamp, the match should have concluded. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the match was postponed. But the search results don't mention any postponement. Therefore, the most logical answer is p2, Michelsen, based on predictions and the absence of contradictory info. However, the user insists on a different approach. Maybe the user wants to consider that Engel won, but there's no evidence. Alternatively, check if any sources mention Engel's victory. \n\nLooking again, source 33 from bossopen.com mentions Engel's match is on June 12 but no result. Source 41 from ATP Tour (June 11) says Engel is to play Michelsen, no result. Source 42 (June 10) also no result. All other sources are predictions. Therefore, no official result. Hence, according to the rules, if the event date is in the past and no info, assume probable outcome (p2). Therefore, the recommendation remains p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Michelsen, Price: 0.045, ID: 27752157486647446581306876199711384302404913216536558203344001618785932624068, Winner: No\n- Token: Engel , Price: 0.955, ID: 78253941415932814177657808139656125782048154165887509937822570540620755129807, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Engel , p2 to Michelsen, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Engel, p2 = Michelsen\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Engel  outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.955 = 95.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
