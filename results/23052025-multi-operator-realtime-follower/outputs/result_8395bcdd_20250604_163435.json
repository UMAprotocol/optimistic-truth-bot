Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nRoute the query to the 'perplexity' solver for processing.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\"), college football (e.g., \"What was the score of the Alabama game last Saturday?\"), college basketball (e.g., \"What was Duke's score in their last game?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.

Your code MUST handle this gracefully with try/except blocks\n\n     Example fallback code structure:\n     ```python\n     def get_data(symbol, start_time, end_time):\n         try:\n             # First try the proxy endpoint\n             response = requests.get(f\"{proxy_url}?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n         except Exception as e:\n             print(f\"Proxy endpoint failed: {str(e)}, falling back to primary endpoint\")\n             # Fall back to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n             response = requests.get(f\"{primary_url}/klines?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n     ```\n     \n6. NEVER include actual API key values in the code, always load them from environment variables.\n\n7. IMPORTANT FOR ALL DATA SOURCES: If a proxy endpoint is provided alongside a primary endpoint, you MUST implement the fallback mechanism described above. This is critical for reliability:\n   - Always try the proxy endpoint first\n   - If the proxy fails, fall back to the primary endpoint\n   - Use appropriate timeout values (10 seconds recommended)\n   - Include proper error handling with try/except blocks\n\nThe code should be completely self-contained and runnable with no arguments.\n\n\nHere's a complete code example that shows how to solve this type of problem:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Note: Binance public API doesn't require an API key for basic price queries\n# However, if we need rate limits increased or private endpoints, we would use these:\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\nBINANCE_API_SECRET = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\")\n\n# Sensitive data patterns to mask in logs\nSENSITIVE_PATTERNS = [\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_KEY\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    #

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Will Fartcoin dip to $0.75 before June?, description: This market will immediately resolve to \"Yes\" if any Dexscreener 1 minute candle for Fartcoin (Fartcoin/SOL) between May 7, 2025, 15:00 and May 31, 2025, 23:59 in the ET timezone has a final \"L\" price of $0.7500 or lower. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No.\"\n\nThe resolution source for this market is Dexscreener, specifically the Fartcoin/SOL \"L\" prices available at https://dexscreener.com/solana/bzc9nzfmqkxr6fz1dbph7bdf9broyef6pnzesp7v5iiw, with the chart settings on \"1m\" for one-minute candles selected on the top bar.\n\nPlease note that the outcome of this market depends solely on the price data from the Dexscreener Fartcoin/SOL trading pair. Prices from other exchanges, different trading pairs, or spot markets will not be considered for the resolution of this market.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749054501 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-04 16:28:21 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport os\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport pytz\n\n# Load environment variables\nload_dotenv()\n\n# API configuration\nPROXY_URL = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\"\nPRIMARY_URL = \"https://api.binance.com/api/v3\"\n\ndef fetch_price_from_dexscreener():\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches the lowest price of Fartcoin/SOL from Dexscreener within the specified date range.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the time range for the query\n    start_date = datetime(2025, 5, 7, 15, 0, tzinfo=pytz.timezone('US/Eastern'))\n    end_date = datetime(2025, 5, 31, 23, 59, tzinfo=pytz.timezone('US/Eastern'))\n    \n    # Convert to timestamps\n    start_timestamp = int(start_date.timestamp() * 1000)  # milliseconds\n    end_timestamp = int(end_date.timestamp() * 1000)  # milliseconds\n\n    # Construct the URL for the API request\n    url = f\"{PROXY_URL}/api/v3/klines\"\n    params = {\n        \"symbol\": \"FARTSOL\",\n        \"interval\": \"1m\",\n        \"startTime\": start_timestamp,\n        \"endTime\": end_timestamp\n    }\n\n    try:\n        # Try fetching from the proxy endpoint\n        response = requests.get(url, params=params)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Proxy failed, trying primary endpoint: {e}\")\n        # Fallback to the primary endpoint\n        url = f\"{PRIMARY_URL}/klines\"\n        try:\n            response = requests.get(url, params=params)\n            response.raise_for_status()\n            data = response.json()\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"Both proxy and primary requests failed: {e}\")\n            return \"recommendation: p4\"\n\n    # Check if any candle's low price is $0.75 or lower\n    for candle in data:\n        low_price = float(candle[3])  # Low price is the fourth element in the list\n        if low_price <= 0.75:\n            return \"recommendation: p2\"  # Yes, price dipped to $0.75 or lower\n\n    return \"recommendation: p1\"  # No, price did not dip to $0.75 or lower\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    result = fetch_price_from_dexscreener()\n    print(result)\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nProxy failed, trying primary endpoint: 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy/api/v3/klines?symbol=FARTSOL&interval=1m&startTime=1746647760000&endTime=1748753700000\nBoth proxy and primary requests failed: 451 Client Error:  for url: https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines?symbol=FARTSOL&interval=1m&startTime=1746647760000&endTime=1748753700000\nrecommendation: p4\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "prompt": "You are an expert Python programmer. I need you to generate code to solve the following prediction market question:\n\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Will Fartcoin dip to $0.75 before June?, description: This market will immediately resolve to \"Yes\" if any Dexscreener 1 minute candle for Fartcoin (Fartcoin/SOL) between May 7, 2025, 15:00 and May 31, 2025, 23:59 in the ET timezone has a final \"L\" price of $0.7500 or lower. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No.\"\n\nThe resolution source for this market is Dexscreener, specifically the Fartcoin/SOL \"L\" prices available at https://dexscreener.com/solana/bzc9nzfmqkxr6fz1dbph7bdf9broyef6pnzesp7v5iiw, with the chart settings on \"1m\" for one-minute candles selected on the top bar.\n\nPlease note that the outcome of this market depends solely on the price data from the Dexscreener Fartcoin/SOL trading pair. Prices from other exchanges, different trading pairs, or spot markets will not be considered for the resolution of this market.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease write Python code that will gather the necessary data to answer this question definitively.\n\nIMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:\n1. DO NOT use command-line arguments. Extract all necessary information from the question itself.\n2. Load environment variables from .env files using the python-dotenv package.\n3. For API keys, use the following environment variables:\n   - BINANCE_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_CBB_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_CFB_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_NBA_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_NFL_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\n\n4. Available Data Sources Information:\n   ALL AVAILABLE API CONFIGURATIONS:\n   - Binance (Category: crypto):\n     * API Key: BINANCE_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.binance.com/api/v3\n     * proxy endpoint: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\n   - Sports Data IO - MLB (Category: sports, Subcategory: baseball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb\n   - Sports Data IO - NBA (Category: sports, Subcategory: basketball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NBA_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nba\n   - Sports Data IO - NFL (Category: sports, Subcategory: football):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NFL_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nfl\n   - Sports Data IO - NHL (Category: sports, Subcategory: hockey):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nhl\n   - Sports Data IO - CFB (Category: sports, Subcategory: college football):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_CFB_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/cfb\n   - Sports Data IO - CBB (Category: sports, Subcategory: college basketball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_CBB_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/cbb\n\n5. Query Type Specific Information:\n\n   Cryptocurrency Data Sources:\n   - Binance:\n     * primary: https://api.binance.com/api/v3\n     * proxy: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\n     * RECOMMENDED: Use this proxy endpoint first for better reliability\n     * Example: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy?symbol=BTCUSDT&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime=TIMESTAMP&endTime=TIMESTAMP\n\n     * CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Since a proxy endpoint is provided, you MUST implement a fallback mechanism:\n       1. Try the proxy endpoint first (better reliability)\n       2. If proxy fails (timeout, error response, etc.), automatically fall back to the primary endpoint\n       3. Your code MUST handle this gracefully with try/except blocks\n\n     Example fallback code structure:\n     ```python\n     def get_data(symbol, start_time, end_time):\n         try:\n             # First try the proxy endpoint\n             response = requests.get(f\"{proxy_url}?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n         except Exception as e:\n             print(f\"Proxy endpoint failed: {str(e)}, falling back to primary endpoint\")\n             # Fall back to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n             response = requests.get(f\"{primary_url}/klines?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n     ```\n     \n6. NEVER include actual API key values in the code, always load them from environment variables.\n\n7. IMPORTANT FOR ALL DATA SOURCES: If a proxy endpoint is provided alongside a primary endpoint, you MUST implement the fallback mechanism described above. This is critical for reliability:\n   - Always try the proxy endpoint first\n   - If the proxy fails, fall back to the primary endpoint\n   - Use appropriate timeout values (10 seconds recommended)\n   - Include proper error handling with try/except blocks\n\nThe code should be completely self-contained and runnable with no arguments.\n\n\nHere's a complete code example that shows how to solve this type of problem:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Note: Binance public API doesn't require an API key for basic price queries\n# However, if we need rate limits increased or private endpoints, we would use these:\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\nBINANCE_API_SECRET = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\")\n\n# Sensitive data patterns to mask in logs\nSENSITIVE_PATTERNS = [\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_KEY\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    #

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Will Fartcoin dip to $0.75 before June?, description: This market will immediately resolve to \"Yes\" if any Dexscreener 1 minute candle for Fartcoin (Fartcoin/SOL) between May 7, 2025, 15:00 and May 31, 2025, 23:59 in the ET timezone has a final \"L\" price of $0.7500 or lower. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No.\"\n\nThe resolution source for this market is Dexscreener, specifically the Fartcoin/SOL \"L\" prices available at https://dexscreener.com/solana/bzc9nzfmqkxr6fz1dbph7bdf9broyef6pnzesp7v5iiw, with the chart settings on \"1m\" for one-minute candles selected on the top bar.\n\nPlease note that the outcome of this market depends solely on the price data from the Dexscreener Fartcoin/SOL trading pair.

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749054501 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-04 16:28:21 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please rewrite the code to fetch and analyze data specifically from Dexscreener for the Fartcoin/SOL trading pair as per the URL provided in the query.

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749054501 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-04 16:28:21 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please revise the code to fetch and analyze historical data from the specified period and ensure it checks the 'L' prices correctly against the target price of $0.75. Additionally, ensure the data structure used in the code matches the actual API response format from Dexscreener."

I need you to generate code to solve the following prediction market question:\n\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Will Fartcoin dip to $0.75 before June?, description: This market will immediately resolve to \"Yes\" if any Dexscreener 1 minute candle for Fartcoin (Fartcoin/SOL) between May 7, 2025, 15:00 and May 31, 2025, 23:59 in the ET timezone has a final \"L\" price of $0.7500 or lower. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No.\"\n\nThe resolution source for this market is Dexscreener, specifically the Fartcoin/SOL \"L\" prices available at https://dexscreener.com/solana/bzc9nzfmqkxr6fz1dbph7bdf9broyef6pnzesp7v5iiw, with the chart settings on \"1m\" for one-minute candles selected on the top bar.\n\nPlease note that the outcome of this market depends solely on the price data from the Dexscreener Fartcoin/SOL trading pair. Prices from other exchanges, different trading pairs, or spot markets will not be considered for the resolution of this market.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease write Python code that will gather the necessary data to answer this question definitively.\n\nIMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:\n1. DO NOT use command-line arguments. Extract all necessary information from the question itself.\n2. Load environment variables from .env files using the python-dotenv package.\n3. For API keys, use the following environment variables:\n   - BINANCE_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_CBB_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_CFB_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_NBA_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_NFL_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\n\n4. Available Data Sources Information:\n   ALL AVAILABLE API CONFIGURATIONS:\n   - Binance (Category: crypto):\n     * API Key: BINANCE_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.binance.com/api/v3\n     * proxy endpoint: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\n   - Sports Data IO - MLB (Category: sports, Subcategory: baseball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb\n   - Sports Data IO - NBA (Category: sports, Subcategory: basketball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NBA_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nba\n   - Sports Data IO - NFL (Category: sports, Subcategory: football):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NFL_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nfl\n   - Sports Data IO - NHL (Category: sports, Subcategory: hockey):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nhl\n   - Sports Data IO - CFB (Category: sports, Subcategory: college football):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_CFB_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/cfb\n   - Sports Data IO - CBB (Category: sports, Subcategory: college basketball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_CBB_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/cbb\n\n5. Query Type Specific Information:\n\n   Cryptocurrency Data Sources:\n   - Binance:\n     * primary: https://api.binance.com/api/v3\n     * proxy: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\n     * RECOMMENDED: Use this proxy endpoint first for better reliability\n     * Example: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy?symbol=BTCUSDT&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime=TIMESTAMP&endTime=TIMESTAMP\n\n     * CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Since a proxy endpoint is provided, you MUST implement a fallback mechanism:\n       1. Try the proxy endpoint first (better reliability)\n       2. If proxy fails (timeout, error response, etc.), automatically fall back to the primary endpoint\n       3. Your code MUST handle this gracefully with try/except blocks\n\n     Example fallback code structure:\n     ```python\n     def get_data(symbol, start_time, end_time):\n         try:\n             # First try the proxy endpoint\n             response = requests.get(f\"{proxy_url}?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n         except Exception as e:\n             print(f\"Proxy endpoint failed: {str(e)}, falling back to primary endpoint\")\n             # Fall back to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n             response = requests.get(f\"{primary_url}/klines?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n     ```\n     \n6. NEVER include actual API key values in the code, always load them from environment variables.\n\n7. IMPORTANT FOR ALL DATA SOURCES: If a proxy endpoint is provided alongside a primary endpoint, you MUST implement the fallback mechanism described above. This is critical for reliability:\n   - Always try the proxy endpoint first\n   - If the proxy fails, fall back to the primary endpoint\n   - Use appropriate timeout values (10 seconds recommended)\n   - Include proper error handling with try/except blocks\n\nThe code should be completely self-contained and runnable with no arguments.\n\n\nHere's a complete code example that shows how to solve this type of problem:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Note: Binance public API doesn't require an API key for basic price queries\n# However, if we need rate limits increased or private endpoints, we would use these:\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\nBINANCE_API_SECRET = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\")\n\n# Sensitive data patterns to mask in logs\nSENSITIVE_PATTERNS = [\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_KEY\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    #

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Will Fartcoin dip to $0.75 before June?, description: This market will immediately resolve to \"Yes\" if any Dexscreener 1 minute candle for Fartcoin (Fartcoin/SOL) between May 7, 2025, 15:00 and May 31, 2025, 23:59 in the ET timezone has a final \"L\" price of $0.7500 or lower. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No.\"\n\nThe resolution source for this market is Dexscreener, specifically the Fartcoin/SOL \"L\" prices available at https://dexscreener.com/solana/bzc9nzfmqkxr6fz1dbph7bdf9broyef6pnzesp7v5iiw, with the chart settings on \"1m\" for one-minute candles selected on the top bar.\n\nPlease note that the outcome of this market depends solely on the price data from the Dexscreener Fartcoin/SOL trading pair. Prices from other exchanges, different trading pairs, or spot markets will not be considered for the resolution of this market.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749054501 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-04 16:28:21 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please rewrite the code to fetch and analyze data specifically from Dexscreener for the Fartcoin/SOL trading pair as per the URL provided in the query. Ensure the code correctly handles the data format from Dexscreener and checks for the specified price condition.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please revise the code to fetch and analyze historical data from the specified period and ensure it checks the 'L' prices correctly against the target price of $0.75. Additionally, ensure the data structure used in the code matches the actual API response format from Dexscreener.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport os\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport pytz\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\ndef fetch_dexscreener_data(pair_id, start_time, end_time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetch historical data from Dexscreener for a specific trading pair within a given time range.\n    \n    Args:\n        pair_id (str): The ID of the trading pair on Dexscreener.\n        start_time (int): Start time in milliseconds since epoch.\n        end_time (int): End time in milliseconds since epoch.\n    \n    Returns:\n        list: List of historical data points.\n    \"\"\"\n    url = f\"https://io.dexscreener.io/u/trading-pairs/{pair_id}/candles\"\n    params = {\n        'from': start_time,\n        'to': end_time,\n        'resolution': '1m'  # 1 minute resolution\n    }\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, params=params)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n        return data['candles']\n    except requests.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Failed to fetch data from Dexscreener: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef check_price_dip_to_target(candles, target_price):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if the price dipped to or below the target price in any of the provided candles.\n    \n    Args:\n        candles (list): List of candle data from Dexscreener.\n        target_price (float): Target price to check against.\n    \n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the price dipped to or below the target price, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    for candle in candles:\n        if float(candle['l']) <= target_price:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    # Define the trading pair ID and target price\n    pair_id = \"bzc9nzfmqkxr6fz1dbph7bdf9broyef6pnzesp7v5iiw\"\n    target_price = 0.75\n\n    # Define the time range (Eastern Time)\n    start_date = datetime(2025, 5, 7, 15, 0, tzinfo=pytz.timezone('US/Eastern'))\n    end_date = datetime(2025, 5, 31, 23, 59, tzinfo=pytz.timezone('US/Eastern'))\n\n    # Convert to UTC and then to milliseconds since epoch\n    start_time_utc = start_date.astimezone(pytz.utc)\n    end_time_utc = end_date.astimezone(pytz.utc)\n    start_time_ms = int(start_time_utc.timestamp() * 1000)\n    end_time_ms = int(end_time_utc.timestamp() * 1000)\n\n    # Fetch the historical data\n    candles = fetch_dexscreener_data(pair_id, start_time_ms, end_time_ms)\n\n    if candles is None:\n        print(\"recommendation: p4\")  # Unable to resolve due to data fetch failure\n        return\n\n    # Check if the price dipped to or below the target price\n    if check_price_dip_to_target(candles, target_price):\n        print(\"recommendation: p2\")  # Yes, price dipped to $0.75 or lower\n    else:\n        print(\"recommendation: p1\")  # No, price did not dip to $0.75 or lower\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nFailed to fetch data from Dexscreener: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='io.dexscreener.io', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /u/trading-pairs/bzc9nzfmqkxr6fz1dbph7bdf9broyef6pnzesp7v5iiw/candles?from=1746647760000&to=1748753700000&resolution=1m (Caused by NameResolutionError(\"<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x7b6d5b6eecb0>: Failed to resolve 'io.dexscreener.io' ([Errno -2] Name or service not known)\"))\nrecommendation: p4\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

I need you to generate code to solve the following prediction market question:\n\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Will Fartcoin dip to $0.75 before June?, description: This market will immediately resolve to \"Yes\" if any Dexscreener 1 minute candle for Fartcoin (Fartcoin/SOL) between May 7, 2025, 15:00 and May 31, 2025, 23:59 in the ET timezone has a final \"L\" price of $0.7500 or lower. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No.\"\n\nThe resolution source for this market is Dexscreener, specifically the Fartcoin/SOL \"L\" prices available at https://dexscreener.com/solana/bzc9nzfmqkxr6fz1dbph7bdf9broyef6pnzesp7v5iiw, with the chart settings on \"1m\" for one-minute candles selected on the top bar.\n\nPlease note that the outcome of this market depends solely on the price data from the Dexscreener Fartcoin/SOL trading pair. Prices from other exchanges, different trading pairs, or spot markets will not be considered for the resolution of this market.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease write Python code that will gather the necessary data to answer this question definitively.\n\nIMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:\n1. DO NOT use command-line arguments. Extract all necessary information from the question itself.\n2. Load environment variables from .env files using the python-dotenv package.\n3. For API keys, use the following environment variables:\n   - BINANCE_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_CBB_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_CFB_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_NBA_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_NFL_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\n\n4. Available Data Sources Information:\n   ALL AVAILABLE API CONFIGURATIONS:\n   - Binance (Category: crypto):\n     * API Key: BINANCE_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.binance.com/api/v3\n     * proxy endpoint: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\n   - Sports Data IO - MLB (Category: sports, Subcategory: baseball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb\n   - Sports Data IO - NBA (Category: sports, Subcategory: basketball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NBA_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nba\n   - Sports Data IO - NFL (Category: sports, Subcategory: football):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NFL_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nfl\n   - Sports Data IO - NHL (Category: sports, Subcategory: hockey):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nhl\n   - Sports Data IO - CFB (Category: sports, Subcategory: college football):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_CFB_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/cfb\n   - Sports Data IO - CBB (Category: sports, Subcategory: college basketball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_CBB_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/cbb\n\n5. Query Type Specific Information:\n\n   Cryptocurrency Data Sources:\n   - Binance:\n     * primary: https://api.binance.com/api/v3\n     * proxy: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\n     * RECOMMENDED: Use this proxy endpoint first for better reliability\n     * Example: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy?symbol=BTCUSDT&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime=TIMESTAMP&endTime=TIMESTAMP\n\n     * CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Since a proxy endpoint is provided, you MUST implement a fallback mechanism:\n       1. Try the proxy endpoint first (better reliability)\n       2. If proxy fails (timeout, error response, etc.), automatically fall back to the primary endpoint\n       3. Your code MUST handle this gracefully with try/except blocks\n\n     Example fallback code structure:\n     ```python\n     def get_data(symbol, start_time, end_time):\n         try:\n             # First try the proxy endpoint\n             response = requests.get(f\"{proxy_url}?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n         except Exception as e:\n             print(f\"Proxy endpoint failed: {str(e)}, falling back to primary endpoint\")\n             # Fall back to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n             response = requests.get(f\"{primary_url}/klines?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n     ```\n     \n6. NEVER include actual API key values in the code, always load them from environment variables.\n\n7. IMPORTANT FOR ALL DATA SOURCES: If a proxy endpoint is provided alongside a primary endpoint, you MUST implement the fallback mechanism described above. This is critical for reliability:\n   - Always try the proxy endpoint first\n   - If the proxy fails, fall back to the primary endpoint\n   - Use appropriate timeout values (10 seconds recommended)\n   - Include proper error handling with try/except blocks\n\nThe code should be completely self-contained and runnable with no arguments.\n\n\nHere's a complete code example that shows how to solve this type of problem:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Note: Binance public API doesn't require an API key for basic price queries\n# However, if we need rate limits increased or private endpoints, we would use these:\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\nBINANCE_API_SECRET = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\")\n\n# Sensitive data patterns to mask in logs\nSENSITIVE_PATTERNS = [\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_KEY\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    #

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Will Fartcoin dip to $0.75 before June?, description: This market will immediately resolve to \"Yes\" if any Dexscreener 1 minute candle for Fartcoin (Fartcoin/SOL) between May 7, 2025, 15:00 and May 31, 2025, 23:59 in the ET timezone has a final \"L\" price of $0.7500 or lower. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No.\"\n\nThe resolution source for this market is Dexscreener, specifically the Fartcoin/SOL \"L\" prices available at https://dexscreener.com/solana/bzc9nzfmqkxr6fz1dbph7bdf9broyef6pnzesp7v5iiw, with the chart settings on \"1m\" for one-minute candles selected on the top bar.\n\nPlease note that the outcome of this market depends solely on the price data from the Dexscreener Fartcoin/SOL trading pair. Prices from other exchanges, different trading pairs, or spot markets will not be considered for the resolution of this market.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749054501 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-04 16:28:21 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please rewrite the code to fetch and analyze data specifically from Dexscreener for the Fartcoin/SOL trading pair as per the URL provided in the query. Ensure the code correctly handles the data format from Dexscreener and checks for the specified price condition.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please revise the code to fetch and analyze historical data from the specified period and ensure it checks the 'L' prices correctly against the target price of $0.75. Additionally, ensure the data structure used in the code matches the actual API response format from Dexscreener.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please verify the correctness of the API endpoint and ensure network configurations allow for successful API calls. Additionally, consider implementing error handling that attempts retries or alternative methods for fetching data in case of initial failures.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport os\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nfrom pytz import timezone\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\n# Load environment variables\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Constants\nDEXSCREENER_API_URL = \"https://api.dexscreener.io/latest/dex/pairs/solana/bzc9nzfmqkxr6fz1dbph7bdf9broyef6pnzesp7v5iiw\"\nTARGET_PRICE = 0.75\nSTART_DATE = datetime(2025, 5, 7, 15, 0, tzinfo=timezone('US/Eastern'))\nEND_DATE = datetime(2025, 5, 31, 23, 59, tzinfo=timezone('US/Eastern'))\n\ndef fetch_dexscreener_data():\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(DEXSCREENER_API_URL)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        return response.json()\n    except requests.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Failed to fetch data from Dexscreener: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef check_price_dip(data):\n    if not data or 'pair' not in data or 'candles' not in data['pair']:\n        return \"p4\"  # Unable to resolve due to data issues\n\n    candles = data['pair']['candles']\n    for candle in candles:\n        # Convert timestamp to datetime in Eastern Time\n        candle_time = datetime.fromtimestamp(candle['timestamp'] / 1000, tz=timezone('US/Eastern'))\n        if START_DATE <= candle_time <= END_DATE:\n            if candle['l'] <= TARGET_PRICE:\n                return \"p2\"  # Yes, price dipped to $0.75 or lower\n    return \"p1\"  # No, price did not dip to $0.75 or lower\n\ndef main():\n    data = fetch_dexscreener_data()\n    result = check_price_dip(data)\n    print(f\"recommendation: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p4\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1.

The user wants to know if Fartcoin will dip to $0.75 before June, specifically looking at the 1-minute candles on Dexscreener for the Fartcoin/SOL pair between May 7 and May 31, 2025, in ET timezone. The resolution depends on whether any of those candles have a low (L) price of $0.75 or lower.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current price and historical data of Fartcoin. The search results show that as of June 4, 2025, Fartcoin is trading around $1.05 to $1.30[3][4][8]. However, the query is about a period that ended on May 31, which is in the past relative to the current timestamp (June 4, 2025). Since the event date is in the past, I need to verify if the price dipped during that window.\n\nLooking at the provided sources, there's a price prediction from May 5, 2025, stating Fartcoin was at $104,172.96, which seems like a typo or error[5]. Another source from June 2, 2025, mentions a current price of $1.065887 with a prediction of dropping to $0.797309 by July 4, 2025[8]. However, this prediction is for a future date relative to the query's timeframe, so it's not directly applicable.\n\nThe Dexscreener API documentation[1][9][14] and the specific Fartcoin/SOL pool page[3][7] indicate that real-time and historical data can be retrieved. However, the GitHub issue[2] mentions that historical data beyond 15 minutes isn't available through their API, which complicates retrieving past 1-minute candles. But since the user provided a direct link to the Dexscreener page for the Fartcoin/SOL pair[3][7], I should check if there's any mention of the price dipping to $0.75 during the specified period.\n\nThe Fartcoin/SOL pool on Raydium shows a current price of around $1.05[3][7], with historical data indicating a 24-hour low of $1.0505[3]. However, this data is from June 4, which is after the event period. The price prediction from June 2[8] suggests a downward trend but doesn't specify hitting $0.75 by May 31.\n\nSince the event period (May 7 to May 31, 2025) has already passed, and no sources explicitly mention Fartcoin reaching $0.75 during that time, the most probable outcome based on available data is that it did not dip to $0.75. The lack of historical data access via Dexscreener's API[2] and the absence of specific mentions in the provided sources lead me to conclude that the resolution should be \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

Your task is to analyze the provided query and decide which AI solver is best suited to handle it.\n\nAvailable solvers: perplexity\n\nSolver descriptions:\n- perplexity: Uses the Perplexity AI search engine to find information online to answer general questions. Best for:\n  * Historical data and events\n  * General knowledge questions requiring context\n  * Questions needing interpretation of complex information\n  * Has knowledge cutoff and may not have very recent information\n\n- code_runner: Executes code to fetch real-time data from specific APIs. Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Available Crypto Data Sources:\n    - Binance: Provides cryptocurrency price data for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies\n  * Available Sports Data Sources:\n    - Sports Data IO - MLB (baseball): MLB baseball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NBA (basketball): NBA basketball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NFL (football): NFL football scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NHL (hockey): NHL hockey scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - CFB (college football): College Football (NCAA) scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - CBB (college basketball): College Basketball (NCAA) scores, statistics, and game data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Will Fartcoin dip to $0.75 before June?, description: This market will immediately resolve to \"Yes\" if any Dexscreener 1 minute candle for Fartcoin (Fartcoin/SOL) between May 7, 2025, 15:00 and May 31, 2025, 23:59 in the ET timezone has a final \"L\" price of $0.7500 or lower. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No.\"\n\nThe resolution source for this market is Dexscreener, specifically the Fartcoin/SOL \"L\" prices available at https://dexscreener.com/solana/bzc9nzfmqkxr6fz1dbph7bdf9broyef6pnzesp7v5iiw, with the chart settings on \"1m\" for one-minute candles selected on the top bar.\n\nPlease note that the outcome of this market depends solely on the price data from the Dexscreener Fartcoin/SOL trading pair. Prices from other exchanges, different trading pairs, or spot markets will not be considered for the resolution of this market.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nRoute the query to the 'perplexity' solver for processing.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\"), college football (e.g., \"What was the score of the Alabama game last Saturday?\"), college basketball (e.g., \"What was Duke's score in their last game?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.).
