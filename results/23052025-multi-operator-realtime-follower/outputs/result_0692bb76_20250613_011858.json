      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" will be mentioned during the second Democratic Mayoral Primary Debate in NYC on June 12, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided to see if there's any indication that these terms were mentioned. The search results include transcripts and articles about the debates, candidates' positions, and related topics.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention Mayor Eric Adams' strong support for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. For example, result [4] and [40] detail Adams advocating for Bitcoin, including proposing a \"BitBond\" and wanting to eliminate the BitLicense. However, Adams is the current mayor running as an independent, so he might not be part of the Democratic primary debate. The Democratic candidates in the debate include Andrew Cuomo, Zohran Mamdani, Adrienne Adams, Brad Lander, Scott Stringer, Zellnor Myrie, and Whitney Tilson.\n\nResult [5] and [6] mention the upcoming debate on June 12, listing the participants. The transcripts from the first debate on June 10 (results [1], [12], [17], [25]) don't show any mentions of crypto or Bitcoin by the Democratic candidates. The focus was on issues like public safety, affordable housing, and policing.\n\nHowever, result [28] is a transcript from Mayor Adams' appearance on Fox 5 on June 6, where he discusses Bitcoin, but again, he's not part of the Democratic debate. Result [34] from May 29 mentions Adams promoting Bitcoin at a conference, but again, he's not a participant in the Democratic debate.\n\nResult [40] and [49] discuss Adams' push for Bitcoin-related policies, but these are separate from the Democratic primary debate. The Democratic candidates' positions from the first debate (results [1], [12], [17], [25]) don't indicate any focus on cryptocurrency. Their discussions revolve around traditional issues like housing, education, and public safety.\n\nResult [63] mentions that in the previous debate, Cuomo attacked Mamdani on other issues but didn't bring up crypto. The candidates' platforms, as per the transcripts, don't highlight cryptocurrency as a key issue. \n\nGiven that the Democratic candidates in the debate haven't previously mentioned crypto or Bitcoin in their debates, and the main pro-crypto figure (Adams) isn't participating, it's unlikely the terms will come up. However, there's a slight chance if a candidate references Adams' policies or if cryptocurrency regulation is brought up as a broader economic issue. But based on the provided sources, there's no direct evidence that any Democratic candidate in the June 12 debate mentioned \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin.\" \n\nTherefore, the resolution should lean towards \"No\" (p1), but considering the possibility of unexpected mentions, there's a small uncertainty. However, the provided sources don't support a Yes answer, so the recommendation is p2: Yes? Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the user's ancillary data says p2 is Yes. Wait, the resolution conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes. But based on the analysis, the candidates in the debate haven't mentioned it in previous debates, and the main proponent (Adams) isn't there. So unless there's a new mention in the June 12 debate, which isn't covered in the provided search results (since the current date in the context is June 13, 2025), but the search results only go up to June 12. Wait, the current timestamp given is 2025-06-13 01:17:21 UTC, so the debate happened on June 12. The search results include articles up to June 12, like result [61] which is a live blog for the debate, but the content isn't detailed. Result [63] from June 12 mentions the debate but doesn't specify crypto mentions. Without explicit mentions in the debate transcripts provided, and considering the candidates' previous focus areas, it's likely the terms weren't mentioned. Therefore, the resolution should be \"No\" (p1). But wait, the user's query is to resolve based on the event that occurred, given the current date is after the debate. The search results don't include post-debate analysis confirming or denying the mention. However, result [61] is a live blog from the debate day, but the content isn't accessible. Other results like [35] and [28] are from Adams, not the Democratic candidates. Since the provided search results don't show any Democratic candidates mentioning crypto/Bitcoin in the debate, and assuming the event has already occurred (current date June 13), the resolution should be \"No\". But the user's personalization instructions say to check if the event is in the past and resolve based on available info. Since the event date is June 12, 2025, which is in the past relative to the current timestamp (June 13), and no sources in the provided context mention the terms being used in the debate, the resolution should be \"No\" (p1). However, there's a possibility that the debate transcript isn't included in the search results. But according to the provided context, the search results don't include the June 12 debate transcript, only the June 10 one. Therefore, based on the available information, the answer is \"No\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749777441 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-13 01:17:21 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" will be mentioned during the second Democratic Mayoral Primary Debate in NYC on June 12, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided to see if there's any indication that these terms were mentioned. The search results include transcripts and articles about the debates, candidates' positions, and related topics.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention Mayor Eric Adams' strong support for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. For example, result [4] and [40] detail Adams advocating for Bitcoin, including proposing a \"BitBond\" and wanting to eliminate the BitLicense. However, Adams is the current mayor running as an independent, so he might not be part of the Democratic primary debate. The Democratic candidates in the debate include Andrew Cuomo, Zohran Mamdani, Adrienne Adams, Brad Lander, Scott Stringer, Zellnor Myrie, and Whitney Tilson.\n\nResult [5] and [6] mention the upcoming debate on June 12, listing the participants. The transcripts from the first debate on June 10 (results [1], [12], [17], [25]) don't show any mentions of crypto or Bitcoin by the Democratic candidates. The focus was on issues like public safety, affordable housing, and policing.\n\nHowever, result [28] is a transcript from Mayor Adams' appearance on Fox 5 on June 6, where he discusses Bitcoin, but again, he's not part of the Democratic debate. Result [34] from May 29 mentions Adams promoting Bitcoin at a conference, but again, he's not a participant in the Democratic debate.\n\nResult [40] and [49] discuss Adams' push for Bitcoin-related policies, but these are separate from the Democratic primary debate. The Democratic candidates' positions from the first debate (results [1], [12], [17], [25]) don't indicate any focus on cryptocurrency. Their discussions revolve around traditional issues like housing, education, and public safety.\n\nResult [63] mentions that in the previous debate, Cuomo attacked Mamdani on other issues but didn't bring up crypto. The candidates' platforms, as per the transcripts, don't highlight cryptocurrency as a key issue. \n\nGiven that the Democratic candidates in the debate haven't previously mentioned crypto or Bitcoin in their debates, and the main pro-crypto figure (Adams) isn't participating, it's unlikely the terms will come up. However, there's a slight chance if a candidate references Adams' policies or if cryptocurrency regulation is brought up as a broader economic issue. But based on the provided sources, there's no direct evidence that any Democratic candidate in the June 12 debate mentioned \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin.\" \n\nTherefore, the resolution should lean towards \"No\" (p1), but considering the possibility of unexpected mentions, there's a small uncertainty. However, the provided sources don't support a Yes answer, so the recommendation is p2: Yes? Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the user's ancillary data says p2 is Yes.

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (0.990 = 99.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
