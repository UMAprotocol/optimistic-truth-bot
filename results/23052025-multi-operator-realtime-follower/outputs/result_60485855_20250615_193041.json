      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump signed an executive order on June 14, 2025, based on the resolution conditions provided. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if the text of an executive order is published on the White House presidential actions page or the press pool by 12 PM ET the next day. If not, it's \"No\". \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any executive orders signed on June 14. Let's go through the sources. \n\nLooking at the search results, source [4] is a proclamation from June 13, 2025, about the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army. Proclamations are different from executive orders, so that's not it. Source [6] mentions an executive order on June 14 regarding Nippon Steel's acquisition. Wait, the article says Trump issued the order on Friday, June 14. The executive order is referenced in the White House's presidential actions. \n\nChecking source [9], the White House presidential actions page lists \"Regarding the Proposed Acquisition of the United States Steel Corporation by Nippon Steel Corporation\" as an executive order on June 13. Wait, there's a discrepancy here. The UPI article (source [6]) states the order was issued on June 14, but the White House page (source [9]) shows it was posted on June 13. Hmm, need to clarify the exact date. \n\nThe user's resolution condition requires the executive order to be published on the listed date, June 14. If the White House published it on June 13, that's before the date in question. However, the UPI article says June 14. Maybe the White House backdated it or there's a time zone difference. The executive order in source [6] is dated June 13 in the text, but the action was taken on June 14. Wait, the executive order text in source [6] says \"IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of June...\" So the order was signed on June 13, but the announcement or publication might have been on June 14. \n\nThe user's condition is based on publication date. The White House page (source [9]) lists the Nippon Steel executive order under June 13. Therefore, even if the news reported it on June 14, the actual publication on the White House site was June 13. That would mean no executive order was published on June 14, leading to a \"No\" resolution. But wait, the UPI article says the executive order was issued on June 14. This is conflicting. \n\nLooking again at source [6], the article states: \"June 14 (UPI) -- President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Friday officially giving the green light...\" So the publication date is June 14. However, the White House's own listing (source [9]) shows it under June 13. This could be due to the time of day when it was posted. If the White House published it late on June 13, it might have been effective or announced on June 14. The user's resolution condition requires the publication to be on the White House page by 12 PM ET the next day. If the order was published on June 13, then it doesn't count for June 14. But the news says it was issued on June 14. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. The executive order's signing date is June 13, as per the document text, but the announcement and publication might have been on June 14. The White House page (source [9]) lists it under June 13, which suggests it was published then. Therefore, according to the user's conditions, since the publication was on June 13, not June 14, the answer would be \"No\". However, the UPI article says it was issued on June 14. This discrepancy needs resolving. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the executive order was signed on June 13 but published on June 14. The user's condition is based on the publication date on the White House page. If it's listed under June 13, then it's not on June 14. Therefore, the market resolves to \"No\". But the user's ancillary data says p2 is \"Yes\". Wait, the resolution conditions state that if the executive order is published on the listed date (June 14), then it's \"Yes\". If the White House page shows it on June 13, then it's \"No\". However, the UPI article (source [6]) says it was issued on June 14. There's a conflict between the sources. \n\nTo resolve this, I need to check the White House's presidential actions page for June 14. Source [9] lists the Nippon Steel executive order under June 13. Source [16] and [17] are videos from June 14 and 15 but don't mention executive orders. Source [11] is a proclamation on June 13. Source [14] is an executive order on June 3. \n\nGiven that the White House's own listing (source [9]) shows the Nippon Steel executive order under June 13, even if the news reported it on June 14, the publication date on the White House site is what matters per the user's conditions. Therefore, no executive order was published on June 14, so the answer is \"No\" (p1). However, the UPI article says the order was issued on June 14. This might be a mistake in the date. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the executive order was signed on June 13 but announced/publicized on June 14. The user's condition requires the text to be published on the White House page on the listed date. Since it's under June 13, it doesn't qualify. Therefore, the resolution should be \"No\". \n\nBut wait, the user's query says the market resolves based on publication on the White House page or the press pool. If the press pool reported it on June 14, that might count. The UPI article (source [6]) is dated June 14 and mentions the executive order. If the press pool reported it on June 14, even if the White House page lists it on June 13, does that count? The user's condition says \"published on the White House page for presidential actions or the White House press pool\". So if the press pool reported it on June 14, that would qualify. \n\nThe UPI article is from June 14 and cites the White House spokesperson. That might count as the press pool reporting. Therefore, even if the White House page lists it on June 13, the press pool announcement on June 14 would trigger a \"Yes\" resolution. \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. The exact timing matters. If the executive order was signed on June 13 but announced to the press pool on June 14, then according to the user's conditions, it would resolve to \"Yes\". However, the White House page's publication date is June 13. The user's condition says both the White House page and the press pool are valid sources. If either one has it by the deadline, it's \"Yes\". \n\nThe UPI article is timestamped June 14, so the press pool reported it on that date. Therefore, even if the White House page published it on June 13, the press pool's report on June 14 would satisfy the condition. Hence, the resolution should be \"Yes\" (p2). \n\nBut I need to confirm if the press pool's report on June 14 is sufficient. The user's condition states: \"immediately resolve 'Yes' if the text... is published on the White House page... or the White House press pool.\" The press pool's report on June 14 would count, so the answer is \"Yes\". \n\nTherefore, despite the White House page listing it on June 13, the press pool's announcement on June 14 meets the criteria. Hence, the resolution is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The user wants to know if Donald Trump signed an executive order on June 14, 2025, based on the resolution conditions provided. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if the text of an executive order is published on the White House presidential actions page or the press pool by 12 PM ET the next day. If not, it's \"No\". \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any executive orders signed on June 14. Let's go through the sources. \n\nLooking at the search results, source [4] is a proclamation from June 13, 2025, about the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army. Proclamations are different from executive orders, so that's not it. Source [6] mentions an executive order on June 14 regarding Nippon Steel's acquisition. Wait, the article says Trump issued the order on Friday, June 14. The executive order is referenced in the White House's presidential actions. \n\nChecking source [9], the White House presidential actions page lists \"Regarding the Proposed Acquisition of the United States Steel Corporation by Nippon Steel Corporation\" as an executive order on June 13. Wait, there's a discrepancy here. The UPI article (source [6]) states the order was issued on June 14, but the White House page (source [9]) shows it was posted on June 13. Hmm, need to clarify the exact date. \n\nThe user's resolution condition requires the executive order to be published on the listed date, June 14. If the White House published it on June 13, that's before the date in question. However, the UPI article says June 14. Maybe the White House backdated it or there's a time zone difference. The executive order in source [6] is dated June 13 in the text, but the action was taken on June 14. Wait, the executive order text in source [6] says \"IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of June...\" So the order was signed on June 13, but the announcement or publication might have been on June 14. \n\nThe user's condition is based on publication date. The White House page (source [9]) lists the Nippon Steel executive order under June 13. Therefore, even if the news reported it on June 14, the actual publication on the White House site was June 13. That would mean no executive order was published on June 14, leading to a \"No\" resolution. But wait, the UPI article says the executive order was issued on June 14. This is conflicting. \n\nLooking again at source [6], the article states: \"June 14 (UPI) -- President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Friday officially giving the green light...\" So the publication date is June 14. However, the White House's own listing (source [9]) shows it under June 13. This could be due to the time of day when it was posted. If the White House published it late on June 13, it might have been effective or announced on June 14. The user's resolution condition requires the publication to be on the White House page by 12 PM ET the next day. If the order was published on June 13, then it doesn't count for June 14. But the news says it was issued on June 14. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. The executive order's signing date is June 13, as per the document text, but the announcement and publication might have been on June 14. The White House page (source [9]) lists it under June 13, which suggests it was published then. Therefore, according to the user's conditions, since the publication was on June 13, not June 14, the answer would be \"No\". However, the UPI article says it was issued on June 14. This discrepancy needs resolving. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the executive order was signed on June 13 but published on June 14. The user's condition is based on the publication date on the White House page. If it's listed under June 13, then it's not on June 14. Therefore, the market resolves to \"No\". But the user's ancillary data says p2 is \"Yes\". Wait, the resolution conditions state that if the executive order is published on the listed date (June 14), then it's \"Yes\". If the White House page shows it on June 13, then it's \"No\". However, the UPI article (source [6]) says it was issued on June 14. There's a conflict between the sources. \n\nTo resolve this, I need to check the White House's presidential actions page for June 14. Source [9] lists the Nippon Steel executive order under June 13. Source [16] and [17] are videos from June 14 and 15 but don't mention executive orders. Source [11] is a proclamation on June 13. Source [14] is an executive order on June 3. \n\nGiven that the White House's own listing (source [9]) shows the Nippon Steel executive order under June 13, even if the news reported it on June 14, the publication date on the White House site is what matters per the user's conditions. Therefore, no executive order was published on June 14, so the answer is \"No\" (p1). However, the UPI article says the order was issued on June 14. This might be a mistake in the date. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the executive order was signed on June 13 but announced/publicized on June 14. The user's condition requires the text to be published on the White House page on the listed date. Since it's under June 13, it doesn't qualify. Therefore, the resolution should be \"No\". \n\nBut wait, the user's query says the market resolves based on publication on the White House page or the press pool. If the press pool reported it on June 14, that might count. The UPI article (source [6]) is dated June 14 and mentions the executive order. If the press pool reported it on June 14, even if the White House page lists it on June 13, does that count? The user's condition says \"published on the White House page for presidential actions or the White House press pool\". So if the press pool reported it on June 14, that would qualify. \n\nThe UPI article is from June 14 and cites the White House spokesperson. That might count as the press pool reporting. Therefore, even if the White House page lists it on June 13, the press pool announcement on June 14 would trigger a \"Yes\" resolution. \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. The exact timing matters. If the executive order was signed on June 13 but announced to the press pool on June 14, then according to the user's conditions, it would resolve to \"Yes\". However, the White House page's publication date is June 13. The user's condition says both the White House page and the press pool are valid sources. If either one has it by the deadline, it's \"Yes\". \n\nThe UPI article is timestamped June 14, so the press pool reported it on that date. Therefore, even if the White House page published it on June 13, the press pool's report on June 14 would satisfy the condition. Hence, the resolution should be \"Yes\" (p2). \n\nBut I need to confirm if the press pool's report on June 14 is sufficient. The user's condition states: \"immediately resolve 'Yes' if the text... is published on the White House page... or the White House press pool.\" The press pool's report on June 14 would count, so the answer is \"Yes\". \n\nTherefore, despite the White House page listing it on June 13, the press pool's announcement on June 14 meets the criteria. Hence, the resolution is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.0025, ID: 62656137332764354190622959283542070417432023385689841250233323193084089673612, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.9975, ID: 21226498694010909387097329938716366811284421199526955927663717741870890176807, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The market resolution depends on whether the text of an executive order is published on the White House's presidential actions page or through the White House press pool by 12 PM ET the next day. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The provided timestamp is June 15, 2025, 19:27:25 UTC, which is 3:27 PM ET. The deadline for publication was 12 PM ET on June 15, so the market should resolve based on whether the executive order was published by then.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are several executive orders from June 2025. The key ones are from June 13: the U.S. Steel acquisition order and the Flag Day proclamation. However, June 14 is the date in question. \n\nSearch result [17] is a proclamation for Flag Day and National Flag Week 2025, dated June 13. The proclamation itself is issued on June 13 but designates June 14 as Flag Day. However, proclamations are considered presidential actions but not executive orders.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750015645 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-15 19:27:25 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please clarify the importance of the publication date on the White House page versus the press pool report and emphasize the need for a clear and concise analysis.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump will sign an executive order on June 14, 2025. The market resolution depends on whether the text of an executive order is published on the White House's presidential actions page or through the White House press pool by 12 PM ET the next day. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The provided timestamp is June 15, 2025, 19:27:25 UTC, which is 3:27 PM ET. The deadline for publication was 12 PM ET on June 15, so the market should resolve based on whether the executive order was published by then.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are several executive orders from June 2025. The key ones are from June 13: the U.S. Steel acquisition order and the Flag Day proclamation. However, June 14 is the date in question. \n\nSearch result [17] is a proclamation for Flag Day and National Flag Week 2025, dated June 13. The proclamation itself is issued on June 13 but designates June 14 as Flag Day. However, proclamations are considered presidential actions but not executive orders. The user specified that executive actions (which include proclamations) do not qualify; only executive orders count. \n\nAnother relevant result is [18], the 250th Anniversary of the U.S. Army, also a proclamation issued on June 13. Again, this is a proclamation, not an executive order. \n\nSearch result [12] mentions executive orders signed on June 12 related to drones and supersonic flight. [13] and [19] are from June 6. The latest executive orders are on June 13 ([14] and [17]), but none are dated June 14. \n\nThe White House presidential actions page ([15], [16]) lists executive orders up to June 13. There's no mention of an executive order published on June 14. Since the deadline has passed without any executive order published for June 14, the market should resolve to \"No\". \n\nIt's important to note that proclamations and other presidential actions don't count here. The user explicitly excluded executive actions, focusing only on executive orders. Therefore, despite the proclamations on June 13, there's no qualifying executive order on June 14. \n\nThus, the resolution should be \"No\" (p1).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.0025, ID: 62656137332764354190622959283542070417432023385689841250233323193084089673612, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.9975, ID: 21226498694010909387097329938716366811284421199526955927663717741870890176807, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (0.998 = 99.8% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
