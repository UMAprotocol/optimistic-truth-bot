      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the 2025 French Open men's final between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz. The market resolves to \"Sinner\" (p1) if he wins, \"Alcaraz\" (p2) if he wins, and 50-50 (p3) if there's a tie, cancellation, or delay beyond June 17, 2025.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The provided timestamp is June 8, 2025, 18:58:25 UTC. The match was scheduled for June 8, 2025, at 9:00 AM ET, which is 13:00 UTC. Since the current time is after the match's start, I need to determine if the match occurred and its result.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources (like [1], [2], [4], [5], [7], [13], [17], [21], [41], [48]) mention the men's final was set for June 8. The detailed match updates in sources [2], [5], [12], [18], [19], [30], [44], [46], [47], [55], [60] describe the match going into five sets. Specifically, [60] states that Alcaraz came back from two sets down to win the third and fourth sets, leading to a fifth set. However, the final result isn't explicitly stated in the provided snippets. \n\nWait, source [60] mentions that Alcaraz staged a recovery to take the match to a fifth set, but the final outcome isn't clear. Other sources like [2], [5], [12], [18], [19], [30], [44], [46], [47], [55] provide live updates but stop at the fifth set without a conclusive result. However, the user's personalization instructions say that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions unless contradicted. \n\nBut wait, the current timestamp is June 8, 2025, 18:58 UTC, which is after the match's scheduled time. The user's personalization also states that if the event is on the same day but at a later time, it's still considered future. However, the match was scheduled for 9:00 AM ET (13:00 UTC), and the current time is 18:58 UTC, which is 5 hours later. Therefore, the event has occurred. \n\nSince the search results include live updates that go into the fifth set but don't show the final result, but the user's instruction says to resolve based on the most probable outcome if no verifiable info is available. However, some sources like [60] mention Alcaraz came back to force a fifth set, but the final result isn't provided. However, looking at source [60], the title says \"French Open Final: Sinner wins first set vs Alcaraz\" but the body mentions Alcaraz forced a fifth set. However, the final result isn't in the provided snippets. \n\nWait, source [60] says: \"Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz staged a staggering recovery after being two sets down to take the French Open final against World No. 1 Italy's Jannik Sinner to the decider. After losing the first two sets 4-6, 6-7 (4), the World No. 2 Spaniard staged a dramatic comeback, winning the third set 6-4 and the fourth 7-6 (3).\" Then it mentions the fifth set is ongoing but doesn't state the final result. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no outcome is found, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But the user also says to check if the event is scheduled for a future date. Since the current time is June 8, 2025, 18:58 UTC, and the match was on June 8, it's in the past. However, the live updates in the sources don't show the final result. \n\nWait, source [5] (from NDTV) in the snippet says: \"French Open 2025 Final LIVE: Alcaraz wins 4th set... The fifth and the final set now begins.\" But there's no info on who won the fifth set. Similarly, source [47] (Roland Garros live) mentions the fifth set is ongoing but no result. \n\nGiven that the user's personalization requires resolving based on verifiable sources, and the provided search results don't explicitly state the final outcome, but the event date is in the past, I need to check if any sources mention the result. \n\nLooking again, source [60] (Rediff) says: \"Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz staged a staggering recovery after being two sets down to take the French Open final against World No. 1 Italy's Jannik Sinner to the decider.\" But the article is from June 8, 2025, and the final set is still ongoing. The user's timestamp is June 8, 18:58 UTC, which is after the match's scheduled time, but the live updates might not have concluded. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no verifiable outcome, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nWait, the user's personalization states: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" Since the event date is June 8, which is the same as the current timestamp (June 8, 18:58 UTC), and the match was scheduled for 9:00 AM ET (13:00 UTC), which is 5 hours earlier, the event has concluded. However, the search results don't provide the final outcome. \n\nIn this case, since the sources don't show the final result, but the user's instruction says to resolve based on the most probable outcome if no info is available. However, the user also says to check if the event is scheduled for a future date. Since it's the same day but the time has passed, the event has occurred. But without the result in the sources, the resolution would be p3 (50-50). However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But how to determine that? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed a source that mentions the result. Let me check again. Source [60] says the match went to a fifth set, but no result. Source [5] also doesn't have the final result. However, source [2] (NDTV) in the snippet says: \"Jannik Sinner vs Carlos Alcaraz Tennis Final LIVE Updates, French Open 2025: In the fourth set, Carlos Alcaraz won by 7-6 scoreline against Jannik Sinner. The final is now levelled at 2-2 as Jannik Sinner clinched the first two sets 6-4. 7-6. Both the players are at their dominating best and giving a tough fight to each other.\" But this is during the match, not the end. \n\nWait, source [60] (Rediff) title says \"French Open Final: Sinner wins first set vs Alcaraz\" but the body says the match went to a fifth set. However, the final result isn't provided. \n\nGiven that the search results provided don't include the final outcome, but the event date is in the past, and the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if no info is available. However, the user's personalization also states that if the event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time, it's still considered future. But in this case, the event time was 13:00 UTC, and the current time is 18:58 UTC, so it's in the past. Therefore, the event has occurred, but the result isn't in the provided sources. \n\nIn this case, according to the user's instructions, if no verifiable information about the outcome is provided, and the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The conditions in the ancillary data say the market resolves to p1 (Sinner) if he wins, p2 (Alcaraz) if he wins. Since the user's query is to resolve the market, and the sources don't provide the final result, but the event date is past, I need to check if there's any indication in the sources. \n\nWait, source [60] says: \"Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz staged a staggering recovery after being two sets down to take the French Open final against World No. 1 Italy's Jannik Sinner to the decider.\" But the final set isn't concluded. However, the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome. Given that Alcaraz was the defending champion and had a strong record against Sinner on clay, but Sinner was in great form, it's a tough call. However, without explicit info, the resolution would be p3. But the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, the user also says to check if the event is scheduled for a future date. Since it's the same day but the time has passed, the event has occurred. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the match was still ongoing at the time of the timestamp. The current timestamp is June 8, 18:58 UTC. If the match started at 13:00 UTC and went into a fifth set, it's possible it was still ongoing. However, the user's personalization says if the event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time, it's still future. But the event was scheduled for 9:00 AM ET (13:00 UTC), and the current time is 18:58 UTC, which is 5 hours later. Tennis matches can last up to 5 hours, so it's possible the match was still ongoing. However, the user's personalization says if the event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time, it's future. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.

Wait, the user's ancillary data has resolution_conditions: p1, p2, p3. The personalization says to return p4 if the event is future, but in the resolution conditions, p3 is 50-50. However, the user's personalization says: \"Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.\" But in the resolution_conditions provided, p3 is 0.5 (unknown/50-50), and p4 isn't mentioned. However, the user's personalization says to use p4 if the event is future. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.

Therefore, the event has already occurred. Therefore, p4 doesn't apply. \n\nBut the search results don't provide the final outcome. Therefore, according to the user's instructions: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" \n\nThe conditions in the user prompt (ancillary_data) say the market resolves to p1 if Sinner wins, p2 if Alcaraz wins. Since the event date is in the past, and no verifiable outcome is found in the sources, we need to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nBut how to determine the most probable outcome? The user's personalization says to use the conditions in the ancillary data. The ancillary data's resolution_conditions are p1, p2, p3. However, without the result, we have to go to p3 (unknown).

The most probable outcome would depend on the match's context. From the search results, Sinner was leading two sets to love, but Alcaraz came back to level at 2-2, forcing a fifth set. The fifth set was ongoing, but no result is given. However, in such cases, if the match isn't concluded, it might be considered postponed or delayed. But the user's personalization says if delayed beyond June 17, resolve to p3. Since the current date is June 8, and the match was on June 8, if it's delayed beyond June 17, then p3. But the match was played on June 8, so if it wasn't completed, it would be postponed. However, the search results don't mention a postponement. \n\nAlternatively, the match might have been completed, but the provided search results don't include the final result. In that case, since the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome, but without data, it's impossible. However, the user's personalization says to resolve based on the most probable outcome. Given that the match went to a fifth set and both players are top competitors, but without the final result, the resolution would be p3. However, the user's personalization might require p3 only if the match is canceled or delayed beyond June 17. Since the match was on June 8 and the current date is June 8, and there's no info on postponement, it's possible the match was completed, but the result isn't in the provided sources. \n\nIn this case, since the user's instructions say to use the primary resolution source (Roland Garros official site), but the provided search results don't include the official result, and the consensus of credible reporting isn't conclusive, the resolution would be p3. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without knowing the result, it's a dilemma. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the match was won by Alcaraz, as he was the defending champion and had a head-to-head advantage. But this is speculative. The user's instructions prohibit speculation and require relying on sources. Since the sources don't provide the final result, the correct resolution is p3 (unknown/50-50). \n\nBut wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" \n\nThe ancillary data's conditions don't specify what's the most probable outcome, just the resolution options.

For example, in source [60], the match is in the fifth set, but no result. However, the user's timestamp is after the match's scheduled time, so it's possible the match concluded, but the provided search results don't include the final result.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749409105 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-08 18:58:25 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the 2025 French Open men's final between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz. The market resolves to \"Sinner\" (p1) if he wins, \"Alcaraz\" (p2) if he wins, and 50-50 (p3) if there's a tie, cancellation, or delay beyond June 17, 2025.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The provided timestamp is June 8, 2025, 18:58:25 UTC. The match was scheduled for June 8, 2025, at 9:00 AM ET, which is 13:00 UTC. Since the current time is after the match's start, I need to determine if the match occurred and its result.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources (like [1], [2], [4], [5], [7], [13], [17], [21], [41], [48]) mention the men's final was set for June 8. The detailed match updates in sources [2], [5], [12], [18], [19], [30], [44], [46], [47], [55], [60] describe the match going into five sets. Specifically, [60] states that Alcaraz came back from two sets down to win the third and fourth sets, leading to a fifth set. However, the final result isn't explicitly stated in the provided snippets. \n\nWait, source [60] mentions that Alcaraz staged a recovery to take the match to a fifth set, but the final outcome isn't clear. Other sources like [2], [5], [12], [18], [19], [30], [44], [46], [47], [55] provide live updates but stop at the fifth set without a conclusive result. However, the user's personalization instructions say that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions unless contradicted. \n\nBut wait, the current timestamp is June 8, 2025, 18:58 UTC, which is after the match's scheduled time. The user's personalization also states that if the event is on the same day but at a later time, it's still considered future. However, the match was scheduled for 9:00 AM ET (13:00 UTC), and the current time is 18:58 UTC, which is 5 hours later. Therefore, the event has occurred. \n\nSince the search results include live updates that go into the fifth set but don't show the final result, but the user's instruction says to resolve based on the most probable outcome if no verifiable info is available. However, some sources like [60] mention Alcaraz came back to force a fifth set, but the final result isn't provided. However, looking at source [60], the title says \"French Open Final: Sinner wins first set vs Alcaraz\" but the body mentions Alcaraz forced a fifth set. However, the final result isn't in the provided snippets. \n\nWait, source [60] says: \"Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz staged a staggering recovery after being two sets down to take the French Open final against World No. 1 Italy's Jannik Sinner to the decider. After losing the first two sets 4-6, 6-7 (4), the World No. 2 Spaniard staged a dramatic comeback, winning the third set 6-4 and the fourth 7-6 (3).\" Then it mentions the fifth set is ongoing but doesn't state the final result. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no outcome is found, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But the user also says to check if the event is scheduled for a future date. Since the current time is June 8, 2025, 18:58 UTC, and the match was on June 8, it's in the past. However, the live updates in the sources don't show the final result. \n\nWait, source [5] (from NDTV) in the snippet says: \"French Open 2025 Final LIVE: Alcaraz wins 4th set... The fifth and the final set now begins.\" But there's no info on who won the fifth set. Similarly, source [47] (Roland Garros live) mentions the fifth set is ongoing but no result. \n\nGiven that the user's personalization requires resolving based on verifiable sources, and the provided search results don't explicitly state the final outcome, but the event date is in the past, I need to check if any sources mention the result. \n\nLooking again, source [60] (Rediff) says: \"Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz staged a staggering recovery after being two sets down to take the French Open final against World No. 1 Italy's Jannik Sinner to the decider.\" But the article is from June 8, 2025, and the final set is still ongoing. The user's timestamp is June 8, 18:58 UTC, which is after the match's scheduled time, but the live updates might not have concluded. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no verifiable outcome, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nWait, the user's personalization states: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" Since the event date is June 8, which is the same as the current timestamp (June 8, 18:58 UTC), and the match was scheduled for 9:00 AM ET (13:00 UTC), which is 5 hours earlier, the event has concluded. However, the search results don't provide the final outcome. \n\nIn this case, since the sources don't show the final result, but the user's instruction says to resolve based on the most probable outcome if no info is available. However, the user also says to check if the event is scheduled for a future date. Since it's the same day but the time has passed, the event has occurred. But without the result in the sources, the resolution would be p3 (50-50). However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But how to determine that? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed a source that mentions the result. Let me check again. Source [60] says the match went to a fifth set, but no result. Source [5] also doesn't have the final result. However, source [2] (NDTV) in the snippet says: \"Jannik Sinner vs Carlos Alcaraz Tennis Final LIVE Updates, French Open 2025: In the fourth set, Carlos Alcaraz won by 7-6 scoreline against Jannik Sinner.

Both the players are at their dominating best and giving a tough fight to each other.\" But this is during the match, not the end. \n\nWait, source [60] (Rediff) title says \"French Open Final: Sinner wins first set vs Alcaraz\" but the body says the match went to a fifth set.

But without the outcome, it's p3. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user expects the assistant to infer the result from the live updates. For example, in source [60], the match is in the fifth set, but no result. However, the user's timestamp is after the match's scheduled time, so it's possible the match concluded, but the provided search results don't include the final result. In this case, the resolution would be p3. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p3.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Alcaraz, Price: 0.9625, ID: 109210849084648656028666217981007093118154625756595589482051891490678777737362, Winner: No\n- Token: Sinner , Price: 0.0375, ID: 57786674911243780982056822350718448148180042944269977125951072812169001353419, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Sinner , p2 to Alcaraz, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Sinner, p2 = Alcaraz\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Alcaraz outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.963 = 96.2% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

Search result 5 from rolandgarros.com mentions Alcaraz forcing a decider and winning the fourth set tiebreak, leading to the fifth set.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749409105 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-08 18:58:25 UTC",
