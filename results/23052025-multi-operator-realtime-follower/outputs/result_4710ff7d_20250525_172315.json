      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Aston Villa will qualify for the 2025-26 UEFA Champions League. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for unknown. The current date is May 25, 2025, which is the final day of the Premier League season. \n\nFirst, I need to check the Premier League standings and the rules for Champions League qualification. From the search results, the Premier League's top four usually qualify, but due to UEFA's coefficient rankings, England has an extra spot, making it top five. So fifth place also gets a Champions League spot. \n\nLooking at the latest standings from source [1], Aston Villa is in 6th place with 66 points. However, sources [4], [5], and [14] indicate that Villa is in a tight race with Chelsea, Newcastle, and Manchester City for the top five. The key here is the final day's matches. \n\nAston Villa is playing Manchester United, who are 16th and in poor form. If Villa wins, they could move up, but they also depend on other results. Chelsea is playing Nottingham Forest, and Newcastle is facing Everton. According to source [14], Villa needs to win and hope either Newcastle loses or Chelsea doesn't win. \n\nThe Opta probabilities in source [4] give Villa a 43.66% chance to make the top five. However, the actual results on the final day are crucial. The live blog in [9] mentions that Villa needs a win and other results to go their way. \n\nSince today is May 25, 2025, and the matches are happening now, the outcome isn't known yet. The user's personalization instructions state that if the event is scheduled for a future time relative to the timestamp (which is 2025-05-25 17:14:48 UTC), and the match is at 15:00 UTC, then it's a past event. Wait, the current timestamp is 17:14 UTC, and the match was at 15:00 UTC. So the match has already concluded. \n\nLooking at source [10], the live score shows the match ended 0-0. So Aston Villa drew with Manchester United. Now, checking the other results: If Chelsea vs. Nottingham Forest and Newcastle vs. Everton have concluded, we need those results. \n\nFrom source [14], if Villa drew, they would need Newcastle to lose and Forest vs. Chelsea to draw. But without the exact results of those matches, it's hard to say. However, the predicted table in [11] and [12] shows Villa finishing 6th with 67 points, which wouldn't be enough for top five. But these are predictions. \n\nWait, the current standings in [13] (Manchester City's site) show Villa in 5th with 67 points, but that might be after the final day. However, without explicit confirmation, it's risky. The resolution source should be credible reporting. Since the match ended in a draw, and depending on other results, Villa might not make it. However, if the other results went their way, they could still qualify. \n\nBut since the user's timestamp is after the match, and the sources don't explicitly state the final standings post-match, I have to infer. The ancillary data says to resolve based on credible reporting. If there's no clear report, but the match ended in a draw, and assuming Chelsea and Newcastle won their games, Villa would miss out. However, if Chelsea lost to Forest and Newcastle lost, Villa might still get in. \n\nBut without explicit results, the safe answer is p4 (cannot resolve). Wait, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. The Opta probability was 43.66%, which is less than 50%, so maybe No. But the draw might not be enough. \n\nAlternatively, the final table in [13] shows Villa in 5th with 67 points, which would qualify them. But I need to confirm if that's the final table. The source [13] is from Manchester City's site, updated after the final day. If Villa is 5th, then p2 (Yes). But I need to check if that's the case. \n\nWait, in [13], the table shows Aston Villa in 5th with 67 points. That's the final standings. So they qualified. Therefore, the answer is p2 (Yes). But I need to ensure that source [13] is credible. Since it's Manchester City's official site, it's reliable. Therefore, Aston Villa qualified for the Champions League.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.

The user wants to know if Aston Villa will qualify for the 2025-26 UEFA Champions League. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for unknown. The current date is May 25, 2025, which is the final day of the Premier League season. \n\nFirst, I need to check the Premier League standings and the rules for Champions League qualification. From the search results, the Premier League's top four usually qualify, but due to UEFA's coefficient rankings, England has an extra spot, making it top five. So fifth place also gets a Champions League spot. \n\nLooking at the latest standings from source [1], Aston Villa is in 6th place with 66 points. However, sources [4], [5], and [14] indicate that Villa is in a tight race with Chelsea, Newcastle, and Manchester City for the top five. The key here is the final day's matches. \n\nAston Villa is playing Manchester United, who are 16th and in poor form. If Villa wins, they could move up, but they also depend on other results. Chelsea is playing Nottingham Forest, and Newcastle is facing Everton. According to source [14], Villa needs to win and hope either Newcastle loses or Chelsea doesn't win. \n\nThe Opta probabilities in source [4] give Villa a 43.66% chance to make the top five. However, the actual results on the final day are crucial. The live blog in [9] mentions that Villa needs a win and other results to go their way. \n\nSince today is May 25, 2025, and the matches are happening now, the outcome isn't known yet. The user's personalization instructions state that if the event is scheduled for a future time relative to the timestamp (which is 2025-05-25 17:14:48 UTC), and the match is at 15:00 UTC, then it's a past event. Wait, the current timestamp is 17:14 UTC, and the match was at 15:00 UTC. So the match has already concluded. \n\nLooking at source [10], the live score shows the match ended 0-0. So Aston Villa drew with Manchester United. Now, checking the other results: If Chelsea vs. Nottingham Forest and Newcastle vs. Everton have concluded, we need those results. \n\nFrom source [14], if Villa drew, they would need Newcastle to lose and Forest vs. Chelsea to draw. But without the exact results of those matches, it's hard to say. However, the predicted table in [11] and [12] shows Villa finishing 6th with 67 points, which wouldn't be enough for top five. But these are predictions. \n\nWait, the current standings in [13] (Manchester City's site) show Villa in 5th with 67 points, but that might be after the final day. However, without explicit confirmation, it's risky. The resolution source should be credible reporting. Since the match ended in a draw, and depending on other results, Villa might not make it. However, if the other results went their way, they could still qualify. \n\nBut since the user's timestamp is after the match, and the sources don't explicitly state the final standings post-match, I have to infer. The ancillary data says to resolve based on credible reporting. If there's no clear report, but the match ended in a draw, and assuming Chelsea and Newcastle won their games, Villa would miss out. However, if Chelsea lost to Forest and Newcastle lost, Villa might still get in. \n\nBut without explicit results, the safe answer is p4 (cannot resolve). Wait, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. The Opta probability was 43.66%, which is less than 50%, so maybe No. But the draw might not be enough. \n\nAlternatively, the final table in [13] shows Villa in 5th with 67 points, which would qualify them. But I need to confirm if that's the final table. The source [13] is from Manchester City's site, updated after the final day. If Villa is 5th, then p2 (Yes). But I need to check if that's the case. \n\nWait, in [13], the table shows Aston Villa in 5th with 67 points. That's the final standings. So they qualified. Therefore, the answer is p2 (Yes). But I need to ensure that source [13] is credible. Since it's Manchester City's official site, it's reliable. Therefore, Aston Villa qualified for the Champions League.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.005, ID: 25874745518178680629003485187721744431898698942785684491690973407051200059496, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.995, ID: 49023139957589335428646840735379335738805121323802325595910560956115930444390, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Aston Villa will qualify for the 2025-26 UEFA Champions League. The resolution depends on their final position in the Premier League and the qualification rules.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current Premier League standings. From the search results, especially [9] and [10], Aston Villa is in 7th place with 57 points after 34 games. But wait, there's a discrepancy here. Result [9] shows Villa at 7th with 57 points, while [10] has them at 6th with 66 points. Hmm, that's confusing. Let me cross-reference. Result [8] mentions the final day permutations, and [14] and [16] discuss the last matches. It seems like the season is ending on May 25, 2025, which is the current date. The latest table in [10] updated on May 25 shows Villa at 6th with 66 points. So maybe [9] is an older snapshot. I should rely on the most recent data.\n\nLooking at the qualification rules from [4], the top five Premier League teams qualify for the Champions League. Additionally, if a team wins the Europa League, they get an extra spot. In [4], it's mentioned that Tottenham, as Europa League winners, will take an extra place, making six English teams in the Champions League. However, the user's query is about Villa qualifying through league position.\n\nIn the current standings from [10], Villa are 6th with 66 points. The top five are Liverpool, Arsenal, Newcastle, Man City, and Chelsea. But according to [8], the final day could change things. Villa are playing Man Utd away. If they win, they could move up. The articles [14] and [16] predict Villa might win and secure a top-five spot. For example, [14] predicts Villa to finish 5th with 69 points if they beat Man Utd. However, [16] has varying predictions, some putting Villa in 5th, others in 6th.\n\nWait, the Premier League table in [10] as of May 25 shows Villa at 6th with 66 points, but the final day's matches could change that. If Villa wins their last game, they'd have 69 points. Other results matter too. For instance, if Chelsea and Forest lose or draw, Villa could overtake them. The BBC pundit in [14] predicts Villa to win and finish 5th. However, other sources like [8] mention that Man City is likely to secure their spot, and Villa needs specific results.\n\nAlso, from [4], the top five qualify, and if Tottenham's Europa League win adds an extra spot, does that mean sixth place could also qualify? Wait, no. The article [4] states that if a team wins the Europa League and isn't in the top five, they get an extra spot. But Tottenham already qualified via the league, so it doesn't add an extra. So the top five get Champions League. Therefore, Villa needs to be in the top five.\n\nLooking at the final day fixtures, Villa is playing Man Utd. If they win, they get to 69 points. Other teams like Chelsea and Forest are also playing. If Chelsea loses to Forest, Villa could move above them. The BBC pundit in [14] predicts Villa to win and finish 5th. However, other predictions in [16] have mixed outcomes. Some have Villa finishing 5th, others 6th.\n\nBut according to the current table in [10], Villa is 6th with 66 points, and the final day's match could push them to 69. If Chelsea (5th with 60 points in [9], but that's conflicting) or other teams drop points, Villa could move up. Wait, the table in [10] shows Chelsea at 5th with 69 points, Newcastle 4th with 66, but that doesn't add up. There's inconsistency in the data. Need to clarify.\n\nWait, result [8] says Man City is 3rd with 61 points, Villa 7th with 57. But [10] has a different table. This is confusing. Maybe the sources are from different times. The user's current date is May 25, 2025, which is the final day. The most recent data would be from [10], updated on May 25, showing Villa at 6th with 66 points. The final match is against Man Utd. If they win, they get 69 points. Other teams like Chelsea (5th with 69) and Newcastle (4th with 66) have their own matches. If Newcastle wins, they get 69, Chelsea if they draw or lose might stay at 69 or drop. It's a tight race.\n\nIn [14], the pundit predicts Villa to win and finish 5th. In [16], four out of five journalists predict Villa to qualify. So the consensus is that Villa has a good chance. However, the actual result depends on today's matches. Since the current timestamp is May 25, 2025, and the matches are yet to be played, but the user is asking now, after the matches. Wait, no. The current timestamp is May 25, 5:14 PM UTC, and the matches are scheduled for later. For example, Villa vs Man Utd is at 4 PM local time, which would be around 3 PM UTC? Wait, the exact time isn't clear, but if the current time is 5:14 PM UTC on May 25, the matches might have already been played. But the search results don't include the final results. The latest data in [10] is updated at 17:59:12 on May 25, which is after 5 PM UTC. So the final matches might have been played, and the table is updated.\n\nLooking at [10], the final table shows Aston Villa at 6th with 66 points. The top five are Liverpool, Arsenal, Newcastle, Man City, Chelsea. So Villa is 6th, which would not qualify them for Champions League via the league. However, in [4], it's mentioned that Tottenham's Europa League win adds an extra spot, making six English teams. Wait, [4] says: \"Tottenham will now play in the Champions League as Europa League winners, making six Premier League teams in the Champions League next season.\" So if the top five plus Tottenham (as EL winners), that's six. But if Tottenham is already in the top five, does that mean the sixth place gets a spot? No, the article says it's an extra place. So if Tottenham won the EL and are in the top five, the sixth place doesn't get a spot. Wait, the article says: \"if a team wins either of the two competitions that come with the reward of a Champions League spot and finish outside the qualifying spots through the league, it counts as an extra place.\" Since Tottenham won the EL and are in the top five, it doesn't add an extra spot. Therefore, only the top five qualify.\n\nBut in [4], it's stated that there will be six Premier League teams in the Champions League because Tottenham won the EL. That suggests that even if they are in the top five, it's an extra spot. Wait, the article says: \"Tottenham will now play in the Champions League as Europa League winners, making six Premier League teams in the Champions League next season.\" So regardless of their league position, winning the EL gives them a spot, and the top five also qualify. So that makes six. Therefore, if Villa is 6th, they would qualify because of Tottenham's EL win. But wait, no. The rules state that the maximum is five unless a team wins a European competition and finishes outside the top four (or five, depending on the competition). But according to the new rules, the top five qualify, and if a team wins the Champions League or Europa League and doesn't finish in the top five, they get an extra spot. If they do finish in the top five, the extra spot isn't added. So in this case, if Tottenham won the EL and are in the top five, the total remains five. But the article says six, which is conflicting. This needs clarification.\n\nLooking back at [4]: \"if a team wins either of the two competitions that come with the reward of a Champions League spot and finish outside the qualifying spots through the league, it counts as an extra place. So Tottenham will now play in the Champions League as Europa League winners, making six Premier League teams in the Champions League next season.\" This implies that Tottenham's EL win adds an extra spot, making six, even if they are in the top five. But that contradicts the standard rules. This might be a misunderstanding in the article. Normally, the extra spot is only added if the team isn't already qualified via the league. So if Tottenham is in the top five, their EL win doesn't add an extra spot. Therefore, the top five qualify. But the article says six, so perhaps the new rules allow for that. This is confusing.\n\nAssuming the article is correct, and six teams qualify, then Villa in 6th would qualify. But according to [10], Villa is 6th with 66 points. However, in [10], the table shows positions 1-5 as Liverpool, Arsenal, Newcastle, Man City, Chelsea. Then Villa at 6th. If six teams qualify, then Villa would make it. But the user's query is about qualifying via the league. The resolution conditions say \"if the listed team qualifies for the 2025-26 UEFA Champions League season.\" So regardless of the method (league or EL win), if Villa is in, it's a yes. But according to the Premier League rules, only the top five qualify. The sixth spot is from the EL win. But if the EL winner is already in the top five, does that spot go to the next league position? The article [4] says that Tottenham's EL win makes six teams, implying that even if they are in the top five, it's an extra. Therefore, Villa in 6th would qualify. But this is conflicting with standard UEFA rules. This needs to be resolved.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the article is incorrect. Let me check another source. From [4]: \"So Tottenham will now play in the Champions League as Europa League winners, making six Premier League teams in the Champions League next season.\" This suggests six teams, so Villa in 6th would qualify. Therefore, the answer would be yes. However, in the Premier League table [10], Villa is 6th, which would mean they qualify via the extra spot from Tottenham's EL win. But the user's query is about qualifying for the Champions League, regardless of the method. Therefore, if Villa is 6th and the sixth spot is granted due to Tottenham's EL win, then the answer is yes. However, according to standard UEFA rules, the maximum is five unless the EL/CL winner isn't in the top five. Since Tottenham is in the top five, the extra spot isn't added. Therefore, only top five qualify. This is a contradiction between the article and standard rules.\n\nGiven that the resolution source is a consensus of credible reporting, and the article [4] states that six teams qualify, then Villa in 6th would qualify. However, other sources like [8] mention that the top five qualify. For example, [8] says: \"Positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5: Champions League\". So if Villa is 6th, they don't qualify. But [4] says six teams are in. This is conflicting.\n\nThe user's ancillary data says the market resolves to \"Yes\" if the team qualifies, regardless of the method. So if Villa is 6th but the EL win grants an extra spot, then yes. But according to [4], that's the case. However, standard rules might not allow that. Since the resolution source is credible reporting, and [4] is a credible source stating six teams qualify, then Villa in 6th would qualify. But in the table from [10], Villa is 6th, so the answer is yes. However, other sources like [8] and [9] indicate only top five. This is a conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table in [10] is incorrect. Let me check again. In [10], the table as of May 25 shows Villa at 6th with 66 points. The top five are Liverpool (84), Arsenal (74), Man City (71), Chelsea (69), Newcastle (66). Wait, that doesn't add up. The points don't align with the positions. This might be a formatting error. Alternatively, different sources have different data. This is very confusing.\n\nGiven the conflicting information, I need to rely on the most recent and credible sources. The Athletic journalists in [16] predict Villa to finish 5th or 6th. If they finish 5th, they qualify. If 6th, it depends on the EL spot. Since [4] states that six teams qualify, Villa in 6th would qualify. Therefore, the answer is yes. However, if the EL spot doesn't apply, then no. But according to the article, it does. Therefore, the resolution would be yes (p2). But the user's previous response was p2, and they want a different approach. Wait, the user's personalization says the previous response was p2, and they want to try again. So maybe the correct answer is p2 (yes), but the user wants to check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the EL spot doesn't apply, and only top five qualify. In that case, Villa in 6th would be no. But the article [4] says six teams. This is a conflict. To resolve this, I need to determine which source is correct. The Premier League's official rules state that the top five qualify, and an extra spot is added if a team wins the EL/CL and isn't in the top five. Since Tottenham is in the top five, the extra spot isn't added. Therefore, only top five qualify. Thus, Villa in 6th would not qualify. However, the article [4] is from May 22, 2025, and states that six teams qualify. This could be a misunderstanding. Therefore, the correct answer is that Villa in 6th don't qualify, so the answer is no (p1). But the journalists in [14] and [16] predict Villa to finish 5th. If they finish 5th, then yes. But according to the final table in [10], they are 6th. This is very confusing.\n\nGiven the timestamp is May 25, 5:14 PM UTC, and the final matches have been played, the table in [10] is updated. Villa is 6th. Therefore, they don't qualify via the league. The EL spot from Tottenham doesn't help because Tottenham is already in the top five. Therefore, the answer is no (p1). However, the article [4] says six teams, which might be incorrect. The resolution source is a consensus of credible reporting. If multiple sources say six teams qualify, then yes. But if the official rules say five, then no. Since the user's resolution source is credible reporting, and [4] is a credible source, but others like [8] say top five, it's conflicting. In this case, the safest answer is p2 (yes) if Villa is 6th and the EL spot applies, but given the confusion, maybe p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome if the event date is in the past. The event date is May 25, which is today, but the current time is 5:14 PM UTC. If the matches are played earlier, the result is known. But without the final results in the search data, it's hard. The table in [10] shows Villa at 6th, so the answer is no. Therefore, p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The user wants to know if Aston Villa will qualify for the 2025-26 UEFA Champions League. The resolution depends on their final position in the Premier League and the qualification rules.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current Premier League standings. From the search results, especially [9] and [10], Aston Villa is in 7th place with 57 points after 34 games. But wait, there's a discrepancy here. Result [9] shows Villa at 7th with 57 points, while [10] has them at 6th with 66 points. Hmm, that's confusing. Let me cross-reference. Result [8] mentions the final day permutations, and [14] and [16] discuss the last matches. It seems like the season is ending on May 25, 2025, which is the current date. The latest table in [10] updated on May 25 shows Villa at 6th with 66 points. So maybe [9] is an older snapshot. I should rely on the most recent data.\n\nLooking at the qualification rules from [4], the top five Premier League teams qualify for the Champions League. Additionally, if a team wins the Europa League, they get an extra spot. In [4], it's mentioned that Tottenham, as Europa League winners, will take an extra place, making six English teams in the Champions League. However, the user's query is about Villa qualifying through league position.\n\nIn the current standings from [10], Villa are 6th with 66 points. The top five are Liverpool, Arsenal, Newcastle, Man City, and Chelsea. But according to [8], the final day could change things. Villa are playing Man Utd away. If they win, they could move up. The articles [14] and [16] predict Villa might win and secure a top-five spot. For example, [14] predicts Villa to finish 5th with 69 points if they beat Man Utd. However, [16] has varying predictions, some putting Villa in 5th, others in 6th.\n\nWait, the Premier League table in [10] as of May 25 shows Villa at 6th with 66 points, but the final day's matches could change that. If Villa wins their last game, they'd have 69 points. Other results matter too. For instance, if Chelsea and Forest lose or draw, Villa could overtake them. The BBC pundit in [14] predicts Villa to win and finish 5th. However, other sources like [8] mention that Man City is likely to secure their spot, and Villa needs specific results.\n\nAlso, from [4], the top five qualify, and if Tottenham's Europa League win adds an extra spot, does that mean sixth place could also qualify? Wait, no. The article [4] states that if a team wins the Europa League and isn't in the top five, they get an extra spot. But Tottenham already qualified via the league, so it doesn't add an extra. So the top five get Champions League. Therefore, Villa needs to be in the top five.\n\nLooking at the final day fixtures, Villa is playing Man Utd. If they win, they get to 69 points. Other teams like Chelsea and Forest are also playing. If Chelsea loses to Forest, Villa could move above them. The BBC pundit in [14] predicts Villa to win and finish 5th. However, other predictions in [16] have mixed outcomes. Some have Villa finishing 5th, others 6th.\n\nBut according to the current table in [10], Villa is 6th with 66 points, and the final day's match could push them to 69. If Chelsea (5th with 60 points in [9], but that's conflicting) or other teams drop points, Villa could move up. Wait, the table in [10] shows Chelsea at 5th with 69 points, Newcastle 4th with 66, but that doesn't add up. There's inconsistency in the data. Need to clarify.\n\nWait, result [8] says Man City is 3rd with 61 points, Villa 7th with 57. But [10] has a different table. This is confusing. Maybe the sources are from different times. The user's current date is May 25, 2025, which is the final day. The most recent data would be from [10], updated on May 25, showing Villa at 6th with 66 points. The final match is against Man Utd. If they win, they get 69 points. Other teams like Chelsea (5th with 69) and Newcastle (4th with 66) have their own matches. If Newcastle wins, they get 69, Chelsea if they draw or lose might stay at 69 or drop. It's a tight race.\n\nIn [14], the pundit predicts Villa to win and finish 5th. In [16], four out of five journalists predict Villa to qualify. So the consensus is that Villa has a good chance. However, the actual result depends on today's matches. Since the current timestamp is May 25, 2025, and the matches are yet to be played, but the user is asking now, after the matches. Wait, no. The current timestamp is May 25, 5:14 PM UTC, and the matches are scheduled for later. For example, Villa vs Man Utd is at 4 PM local time, which would be around 3 PM UTC? Wait, the exact time isn't clear, but if the current time is 5:14 PM UTC on May 25, the matches might have already been played. But the search results don't include the final results. The latest data in [10] is updated at 17:59:12 on May 25, which is after 5 PM UTC. So the final matches might have been played, and the table is updated.\n\nLooking at [10], the final table shows Aston Villa at 6th with 66 points. The top five are Liverpool, Arsenal, Newcastle, Man City, Chelsea. So Villa is 6th, which would not qualify them for Champions League via the league. However, in [4], it's mentioned that Tottenham's Europa League win adds an extra spot, making six English teams. Wait, [4] says: \"Tottenham will now play in the Champions League as Europa League winners, making six Premier League teams in the Champions League next season.\" So if the top five plus Tottenham (as EL winners), that's six. But if Tottenham is already in the top five, does that mean the sixth place gets a spot? No, the article says it's an extra place. So if Tottenham won the EL and are in the top five, the sixth place doesn't get a spot. Wait, the article says: \"if a team wins either of the two competitions that come with the reward of a Champions League spot and finish outside the qualifying spots through the league, it counts as an extra place.\" Since Tottenham won the EL and are in the top five, it doesn't add an extra spot. Therefore, only the top five qualify.\n\nBut in [4], it's stated that there will be six Premier League teams in the Champions League because Tottenham won the EL. That suggests that even if they are in the top five, it's an extra spot. Wait, the article says: \"Tottenham will now play in the Champions League as Europa League winners, making six Premier League teams in the Champions League next season.\" So regardless of their league position, winning the EL gives them a spot, and the top five also qualify. So that makes six. Therefore, if Villa is 6th, they would qualify because of Tottenham's EL win. But wait, no. The rules state that the maximum is five unless a team wins a European competition and finishes outside the top four (or five, depending on the competition). But according to the new rules, the top five qualify, and if a team wins the Champions League or Europa League and doesn't finish in the top five, they get an extra spot. If they do finish in the top five, the extra spot isn't added. So in this case, if Tottenham won the EL and are in the top five, the total remains five. But the article says six, which is conflicting. This needs clarification.\n\nLooking back at [4]: \"if a team wins either of the two competitions that come with the reward of a Champions League spot and finish outside the qualifying spots through the league, it counts as an extra place. So Tottenham will now play in the Champions League as Europa League winners, making six Premier League teams in the Champions League next season.\" This implies that Tottenham's EL win adds an extra spot, making six, even if they are in the top five. But that contradicts the standard rules. This might be a misunderstanding in the article. Normally, the extra spot is only added if the team isn't already qualified via the league. So if Tottenham is in the top five, their EL win doesn't add an extra spot. Therefore, the top five qualify. But the article says six, so perhaps the new rules allow for that. This is confusing.\n\nAssuming the article is correct, and six teams qualify, then Villa in 6th would qualify. But according to [10], Villa is 6th with 66 points. However, in [10], the table shows positions 1-5 as Liverpool, Arsenal, Newcastle, Man City, Chelsea. Then Villa at 6th. If six teams qualify, then Villa would make it. But the user's query is about qualifying via the league. The resolution conditions say \"if the listed team qualifies for the 2025-26 UEFA Champions League season.\" So regardless of the method (league or EL win), if Villa is in, it's a yes. But according to the Premier League rules, only the top five qualify. The sixth spot is from the EL win. But if the EL winner is already in the top five, does that spot go to the next league position? The article [4] says that Tottenham's EL win makes six teams, implying that even if they are in the top five, it's an extra. Therefore, Villa in 6th would qualify. But this is conflicting with standard UEFA rules. This needs to be resolved.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the article is incorrect. Let me check another source. From [4]: \"So Tottenham will now play in the Champions League as Europa League winners, making six Premier League teams in the Champions League next season.\" This suggests six teams, so Villa in 6th would qualify. Therefore, the answer would be yes. However, in the Premier League table [10], Villa is 6th, which would mean they qualify via the extra spot from Tottenham's EL win. But the user's query is about qualifying for the Champions League, regardless of the method. Therefore, if Villa is 6th and the sixth spot is granted due to Tottenham's EL win, then the answer is yes. However, according to standard UEFA rules, the maximum is five unless the EL/CL winner isn't in the top five. Since Tottenham is in the top five, the extra spot isn't added. Therefore, only top five qualify. This is a contradiction between the article and standard rules.\n\nGiven that the resolution source is a consensus of credible reporting, and the article [4] states that six teams qualify, then Villa in 6th would qualify. However, other sources like [8] mention that the top five qualify. For example, [8] says: \"Positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5: Champions League\". So if Villa is 6th, they don't qualify. But [4] says six teams are in. This is conflicting.\n\nThe user's ancillary data says the market resolves to \"Yes\" if the team qualifies, regardless of the method. So if Villa is 6th but the EL win grants an extra spot, then yes. But according to [4], that's the case. However, standard rules might not allow that. Since the resolution source is credible reporting, and [4] is a credible source stating six teams qualify, then Villa in 6th would qualify. But in the table from [10], Villa is 6th, so the answer is yes. However, other sources like [8] and [9] indicate only top five. This is a conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table in [10] is incorrect. Let me check again. In [10], the table as of May 25 shows Villa at 6th with 66 points. The top five are Liverpool (84), Arsenal (74), Man City (71), Chelsea (69), Newcastle (66). Wait, that doesn't add up. The points don't align with the positions. This might be a formatting error. Alternatively, different sources have different data. This is very confusing.\n\nGiven the conflicting information, I need to rely on the most recent and credible sources. The Athletic journalists in [16] predict Villa to finish 5th or 6th. If they finish 5th, they qualify. If 6th, it depends on the EL spot. Since [4] states that six teams qualify, Villa in 6th would qualify. Therefore, the answer is yes. However, if the EL spot doesn't apply, then no. But according to the article, it does. Therefore, the resolution would be yes (p2). But the user's previous response was p2, and they want a different approach. Wait, the user's personalization says the previous response was p2, and they want to try again. So maybe the correct answer is p2 (yes), but the user wants to check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the EL spot doesn't apply, and only top five qualify. In that case, Villa in 6th would be no. But the article [4] says six teams. This is a conflict. To resolve this, I need to determine which source is correct. The Premier League's official rules state that the top five qualify, and an extra spot is added if a team wins the EL/CL and isn't in the top five. Since Tottenham is in the top five, the extra spot isn't added. Therefore, only top five qualify. Thus, Villa in 6th would not qualify. However, the article [4] is from May 22, 2025, and states that six teams qualify. This could be a misunderstanding. Therefore, the correct answer is that Villa in 6th don't qualify, so the answer is no (p1). But the journalists in [14] and [16] predict Villa to finish 5th. If they finish 5th, then yes. But according to the final table in [10], they are 6th. This is very confusing.\n\nGiven the timestamp is May 25, 5:14 PM UTC, and the final matches have been played, the table in [10] is updated. Villa is 6th. Therefore, they don't qualify via the league. The EL spot from Tottenham doesn't help because Tottenham is already in the top five. Therefore, the answer is no (p1). However, the article [4] says six teams, which might be incorrect. The resolution source is a consensus of credible reporting. If multiple sources say six teams qualify, then yes. But if the official rules say five, then no. Since the user's resolution source is credible reporting, and [4] is a credible source, but others like [8] say top five, it's conflicting. In this case, the safest answer is p2 (yes) if Villa is 6th and the EL spot applies, but given the confusion, maybe p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome if the event date is in the past. The event date is May 25, which is today, but the current time is 5:14 PM UTC. If the matches are played earlier, the result is known. But without the final results in the search data, it's hard. The table in [10] shows Villa at 6th, so the answer is no. Therefore, p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.005, ID: 25874745518178680629003485187721744431898698942785684491690973407051200059496, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.995, ID: 49023139957589335428646840735379335738805121323802325595910560956115930444390, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if Aston Villa will qualify for the 2025-26 UEFA Champions League. The resolution conditions are p2 for Yes and p1 for No. The current timestamp is May 25, 2025, so the season has just ended.\n\nFirst, I need to check the latest Premier League standings. According to search result [5], the final table as of May 25, 2025, shows Aston Villa in 6th place with 66 points. The top four are Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City, and Chelsea. Newcastle is 5th with 66 points but a better goal difference. Wait, the table in [5] lists Newcastle as 5th with 66 points and Aston Villa as 6th with 66 points. But how do they break the tie? The table shows Newcastle has a goal difference of +21, while Villa has +7. So Newcastle would be above Villa.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned Tottenham's Europa League win. From [9], Tottenham won the Europa League, which grants them a Champions League spot. However, the article states that despite being 17th in the Premier League, their Europa League win gives them automatic qualification. This adds another team from England to the Champions League.\n\nNow, the Premier League's allocation. Normally, the top four qualify, but due to UEFA's coefficient performance, England gets an extra spot, making it top five. However, with Tottenham's win, does that add another spot? According to [12], if a team wins the Europa League and doesn't finish in the top positions, they get a spot, but this doesn't take away from the domestic allocation. So, the top five plus Tottenham would make six teams. But wait, [9] mentions that the top five in the Premier League qualify, and the Europa League winner (Tottenham) gets another spot, making it six. However, [13] explains that the European Performance Spot (EPS) gives England a fifth place, and the Europa League winner adds another. So, total six teams: top five in the league plus Tottenham.\n\nBut looking at the final table in [5], the top five are Liverpool (1st), Arsenal (2nd), Manchester City (3rd), Chelsea (4th), Newcastle (5th). Then Aston Villa is 6th. If the top five qualify, plus Tottenham as Europa winners, that's six. However, [9] states that the EPS grants fifth place a spot, and the Europa League winner adds another. So Villa in 6th wouldn't qualify unless there's another factor.\n\nWait, [9] also mentions that the FA Cup winner (Crystal Palace, from [18]) gets a Europa League spot. But how does that affect Champions League spots? The main point is the Champions League allocation. The EPS gives England five spots, and Tottenham's win adds a sixth. So the top five in the league (1st to 5th) plus Tottenham. Therefore, Aston Villa in 6th wouldn't qualify. But wait, [13] says that the EPS is fifth place, so the top five qualify. Then, if Tottenham's win adds another, that's sixth. But in the Premier League table, the top five are already in, and Tottenham is 17th. So the sixth spot goes to Tottenham, not based on league position. Therefore, Aston Villa in 6th doesn't get a spot. Hence, the answer would be No (p1). But the user's previous response was p2, so they want a recheck.\n\nWait, let me cross-verify. From [9]: \"the Europa League win automatically grants them a place in the group phase of the Champions League.\" So Tottenham is in regardless of their league position. The top five from the Premier League (1st to 5th) qualify via league position. Then, Tottenham's win adds a sixth spot. So total six teams: Liverpool, Arsenal, Man City, Chelsea, Newcastle, and Tottenham. Aston Villa is 6th in the league, but the sixth spot is taken by Tottenham's win. Therefore, Villa doesn't qualify. Hence, the answer should be p1 (No). But the user says the previous response was p2, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking at [13], it says: \"the top five in the Premier League will qualify for next season's Champions League based on league position alone.\" Then, the Europa League winner (Tottenham) gets another spot. So that's six teams. But Aston Villa is 6th in the league, which is outside the top five. Therefore, they don't qualify. Hence, the answer is No (p1). But the user's additional instructions mention the impact of Tottenham's Europa League win. The user wants to clarify if Villa still qualifies despite Tottenham's win. \n\nWait, maybe the confusion is whether the Europa League winner spot is in addition to the top five. If England has five spots via league (top five) and Tottenham wins Europa, they get a sixth. So Villa in 6th doesn't get it. But if the EPS is fifth, and the Europa winner is separate, then the top five plus Tottenham make six. Therefore, Villa in 6th doesn't qualify. Hence, the answer is No (p1). But the user's previous response was p2, so perhaps there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the EPS allows for fifth, and the Europa winner doesn't take a domestic spot. Let me check [15] and [16].\n\nFrom [16]: \"the extra spots will go to one of the top leagues, fifth place will enter the Champions League and the two leagues will have eight (rather than seven) places in Europe.\" So with the EPS, England's top five qualify. Then, if a team wins the Europa League and isn't in the top five, they get an additional spot. So in this case, Tottenham is 17th, so they get a spot, making it six teams. Therefore, the top five (1-5) plus Tottenham. Aston Villa is 6th, so they don't qualify. Hence, the answer is No (p1). Therefore, the previous response of p2 (Yes) was incorrect. The correct answer should be p1 (No). But the user wants a recheck, so maybe I need to confirm again.\n\nWait, looking at [9] again: \"UEFA rules introduced last season see the two nations with the highest coefficients for the 2024-25 campaign will each be handed an extra qualification spot. The performance of English clubs in Europe this season has guaranteed England a top-two UEFA coefficient for the 2024-25 campaign and an extra Champions League place as a \u2018European Performance Spot\u2019 (EPS). The top four in the Premier League typically qualifies for the Champions League plus the European Performance Spot which grants qualification to fifth place while the Europa League spot is passed down to sixth.\" So the EPS makes it top five. Then, Tottenham's Europa win adds another, making it six. Therefore, the six teams are top five (1-5) plus Tottenham. Aston Villa is 6th in the league, so they don't make it. Hence, the answer is No (p1). Therefore, the correct recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The user wants to know if Aston Villa will qualify for the 2025-26 UEFA Champions League. The resolution conditions are p2 for Yes and p1 for No. The current timestamp is May 25, 2025, so the season has just ended.\n\nFirst, I need to check the latest Premier League standings. According to search result [5], the final table as of May 25, 2025, shows Aston Villa in 6th place with 66 points. The top four are Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City, and Chelsea. Newcastle is 5th with 66 points but a better goal difference. Wait, the table in [5] lists Newcastle as 5th with 66 points and Aston Villa as 6th with 66 points. But how do they break the tie? The table shows Newcastle has a goal difference of +21, while Villa has +7. So Newcastle would be above Villa.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned Tottenham's Europa League win. From [9], Tottenham won the Europa League, which grants them a Champions League spot. However, the article states that despite being 17th in the Premier League, their Europa League win gives them automatic qualification. This adds another team from England to the Champions League.\n\nNow, the Premier League's allocation. Normally, the top four qualify, but due to UEFA's coefficient performance, England gets an extra spot, making it top five. However, with Tottenham's win, does that add another spot? According to [12], if a team wins the Europa League and doesn't finish in the top positions, they get a spot, but this doesn't take away from the domestic allocation. So, the top five plus Tottenham would make six teams. But wait, [9] mentions that the top five in the Premier League qualify, and the Europa League winner (Tottenham) gets another spot, making it six.

So, total six teams: top five in the league plus Tottenham.\n\nBut looking at the final table in [5], the top five are Liverpool (1st), Arsenal (2nd), Manchester City (3rd), Chelsea (4th), Newcastle (5th).

So Villa in 6th wouldn't qualify unless there's another factor.\n\nWait, [9] also mentions that the FA Cup winner (Crystal Palace, from [18]) gets a Europa League spot. But how does that affect Champions League spots? The main point is the Champions League allocation. The EPS gives England five spots, and Tottenham's win adds a sixth.

But if the EPS is fifth, and the Europa winner is separate, then the top five plus Tottenham make six. Therefore, Villa in 6th doesn't qualify. Hence, the answer is No (p1).

Therefore, the top five (1-5) plus Tottenham. Aston Villa is 6th, so they don't qualify. Hence, the answer is No (p1). Therefore, the previous response of p2 (Yes) was incorrect. The correct answer should be p1 (No). But the user wants a recheck, so maybe I need to confirm again.\n\nWait, looking at [9] again: \"UEFA rules introduced last season see the two nations with the highest coefficients for the 2024-25 campaign will each be handed an extra qualification spot. The performance of English clubs in Europe this season has guaranteed England a top-two UEFA coefficient for the 2024-25 campaign and an extra Champions League place as a \u2018European Performance Spot\u2019 (EPS).

Then, Tottenham's Europa win adds another, making it six. Therefore, the six teams are top five (1-5) plus Tottenham. Aston Villa is 6th in the league, so they don't make it. Hence, the answer is No (p1).

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Aston Villa will qualify for the 2025-26 UEFA Champions League. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for unknown. The current date is May 25, 2025, and the final Premier League matches are today.\n\nFirst, I need to check the latest Premier League standings. From the search results, especially [1], [2], [5], [6], [11], [15], and [16], Aston Villa's position varies between 5th and 7th depending on the source. However, looking at the most recent data, like in [11] and [16], after 37 or 38 games, Villa is 6th with 66 points. Wait, [11] shows them at 6th with 66 points, while [16] also has them at 5th with 66 points. There's some inconsistency here. Let me cross-reference.\n\nIn [15], the standings as of May 18, 2025, show Aston Villa in 5th with 66 points, same as Chelsea, but with a lower goal difference. The final day's matches include Villa playing Manchester United. If they win, they could secure 5th. However, other teams like Newcastle, Chelsea, and Nottingham Forest are also in the mix. \n\nLooking at the Opta probabilities in [5], Aston Villa had a 43.66% chance to finish in the top five. But that was before the final matches. The key is today's results. If Villa wins against Manchester United, they might climb to 5th, depending on other results. For example, if Chelsea and Newcastle lose or draw, Villa could overtake them. \n\nThe user's ancillary data says the market resolves based on credible reporting. The resolution source needs to be a consensus. Since the final matches are today, I need to check the results. However, the current timestamp is May 25, 2025, 17:14:48 UTC. The match against Manchester United is scheduled for today, but the time isn't specified in the search results. If the match hasn't happened yet, the event is in the future, so resolve to p4. But if the match has already occurred, check the result.\n\nLooking at [8], the fixture for May 25 is Manchester United vs. Aston Villa, with the latest score being 2-0 to Manchester United in the 90th minute. Wait, [8] shows \"Manchester United, 2. Aston Villa, 0. Latest score. 90th minute.\" That implies the match is over, and Villa lost 2-0. If that's the case, Villa remains on 66 points. \n\nChecking other teams' final matches: Chelsea plays Nottingham Forest. If Chelsea wins, they get 69 points. Newcastle plays Everton. If Newcastle wins, they get 69 points. Nottingham Forest, if they beat Chelsea, could reach 68 points. But if Villa lost, they can't surpass Chelsea or Newcastle. The top five would be Liverpool, Arsenal, Man City, Chelsea, Newcastle. So Villa finishes 6th, missing out. Therefore, the answer should be p1 (No). \n\nBut wait, in [16], the table shows Villa at 5th with 66 points. Maybe there's a discrepancy in the sources. Need to verify which source is most recent. [11] is updated on May 25, 2025, at 17:59:12 UTC, showing Villa at 6th with 66 points, behind Chelsea (69) and Newcastle (66 but better GD). So if Villa lost to Man Utd, they stay at 66, and depending on other results, maybe Newcastle and Chelsea are above. Therefore, Villa doesn't make top five. Hence, resolve to p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1748193288 Current Date and Time: 2025-05-25 17:14:48 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Aston Villa will qualify for the 2025-26 UEFA Champions League. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for unknown. The current date is May 25, 2025, and the final Premier League matches are today.\n\nFirst, I need to check the latest Premier League standings. From the search results, especially [1], [2], [5], [6], [11], [15], and [16], Aston Villa's position varies between 5th and 7th depending on the source. However, looking at the most recent data, like in [11] and [16], after 37 or 38 games, Villa is 6th with 66 points. Wait, [11] shows them at 6th with 66 points, while [16] also has them at 5th with 66 points. There's some inconsistency here. Let me cross-reference.\n\nIn [15], the standings as of May 18, 2025, show Aston Villa in 5th with 66 points, same as Chelsea, but with a lower goal difference. The final day's matches include Villa playing Manchester United. If they win, they could secure 5th. However, other teams like Newcastle, Chelsea, and Nottingham Forest are also in the mix. \n\nLooking at the Opta probabilities in [5], Aston Villa had a 43.66% chance to finish in the top five. But that was before the final matches. The key is today's results. If Villa wins against Manchester United, they might climb to 5th, depending on other results. For example, if Chelsea and Newcastle lose or draw, Villa could overtake them. \n\nThe user's ancillary data says the market resolves based on credible reporting. The resolution source needs to be a consensus. Since the final matches are today, I need to check the results. However, the current timestamp is May 25, 2025, 17:14:48 UTC. The match against Manchester United is scheduled for today, but the time isn't specified in the search results. If the match hasn't happened yet, the event is in the future, so resolve to p4. But if the match has already occurred, check the result.\n\nLooking at [8], the fixture for May 25 is Manchester United vs. Aston Villa, with the latest score being 2-0 to Manchester United in the 90th minute. Wait, [8] shows \"Manchester United, 2. Aston Villa, 0. Latest score. 90th minute.\" That implies the match is over, and Villa lost 2-0. If that's the case, Villa remains on 66 points. \n\nChecking other teams' final matches: Chelsea plays Nottingham Forest. If Chelsea wins, they get 69 points. Newcastle plays Everton. If Newcastle wins, they get 69 points. Nottingham Forest, if they beat Chelsea, could reach 68 points. But if Villa lost, they can't surpass Chelsea or Newcastle. The top five would be Liverpool, Arsenal, Man City, Chelsea, Newcastle. So Villa finishes 6th, missing out. Therefore, the answer should be p1 (No). \n\nBut wait, in [16], the table shows Villa at 5th with 66 points. Maybe there's a discrepancy in the sources. Need to verify which source is most recent. [11] is updated on May 25, 2025, at 17:59:12 UTC, showing Villa at 6th with 66 points, behind Chelsea (69) and Newcastle (66 but better GD). So if Villa lost to Man Utd, they stay at 66, and depending on other results, maybe Newcastle and Chelsea are above. Therefore, Villa doesn't make top five. Hence, resolve to p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.005, ID: 25874745518178680629003485187721744431898698942785684491690973407051200059496, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.995, ID: 49023139957589335428646840735379335738805121323802325595910560956115930444390, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1748193288 Current Date and Time: 2025-05-25 17:14:48 UTC",
