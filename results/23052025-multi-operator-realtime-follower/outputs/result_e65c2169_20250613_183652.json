      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether Iran initiated a military action on Israeli soil, airspace, maritime territory, or any official Israeli embassy or consulate between June 11 and June 30, 2025, based on the ancillary data provided. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. The user also provided a bunch of search results, mostly from June 13, 2025, detailing Israeli strikes on Iran and Iran's retaliatory drone attacks.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the ancillary data. The market resolves to Yes (p2) if Iran conducted a military action as defined. The key points are: the action must be by Iranian forces (not proxies), confirmed by Iran or credible reports, and it must target Israeli soil, airspace, maritime areas, or embassies. Cyber attacks, sanctions, or proxy actions don't count. The update clarifies that drone/missile strikes entering Israeli airspace count even if intercepted.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources (like [2], [9], [10], [17], [30], [41], [44], [58]) mention Iran launching over 100 drones towards Israel on June 13. The IDF intercepted these drones outside Israeli territory, some over Saudi Arabia and Jordan. For example, source [10] states that the IDF intercepted drones beyond Israeli airspace, with some intercepted by Jordan. Source [30] says the drones were intercepted outside Israel's borders. \n\nThe critical question is whether any of these drones entered Israeli airspace. The definition says that if they enter Israeli airspace, even if intercepted, it counts. However, if they were intercepted before entering, it doesn't. The search results consistently mention interception outside Israel, like over Jordan or Saudi Arabia. For instance, source [43] notes Jordan intercepted drones that entered its airspace en route to Israel. Source [10] and [30] mention interception in Saudi and Jordanian airspace. \n\nThere's no mention in the provided sources of any Iranian drones successfully entering Israeli airspace. All reports indicate interception occurred outside Israel. Therefore, according to the market's rules, since the drones didn't enter Israeli airspace, the action doesn't qualify. Even though Iran launched the drones, they were intercepted before reaching Israeli territory. \n\nAdditionally, the market requires the action to be between June 11 and June 30. The events here are on June 13, which is within the timeframe. However, since the drones didn't enter Israeli airspace, the answer should be No (p1). The user's update also specifies that attempted strikes not entering airspace don't count. \n\nI should also check if there were any other actions by Iran within the timeframe. The search results focus on the June 13 events. No other military actions by Iran on Israeli soil, airspace, etc., are mentioned. All sources point to the drone attack being the main event, which was intercepted outside Israel. \n\nTherefore, based on the evidence, the resolution should be p2: No.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe market resolves to \"No\" (p1) because while Iran launched over 100 drones toward Israel on June 13, 2025, in retaliation for Israeli strikes, **all were intercepted outside Israeli airspace** (e.g., over Jordan or Saudi Arabia)[10][30][43]. Per the resolution rules, only strikes **entering Israeli airspace** qualify, even if intercepted. Since no Iranian drones or missiles breached Israeli airspace or territory, and no other Iranian military actions against Israeli soil/embassies occurred between June 11\u201330, the criteria for \"Yes\" (p2) are unmet.",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749839555 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-13 18:32:35 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether Iran initiated a military action on Israeli soil, airspace, maritime territory, or any official Israeli embassy or consulate between June 11 and June 30, 2025, based on the ancillary data provided. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. The user also provided a bunch of search results, mostly from June 13, 2025, detailing Israeli strikes on Iran and Iran's retaliatory drone attacks.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the ancillary data. The market resolves to Yes (p2) if Iran conducted a military action as defined. The key points are: the action must be by Iranian forces (not proxies), confirmed by Iran or credible reports, and it must target Israeli soil, airspace, maritime areas, or embassies. Cyber attacks, sanctions, or proxy actions don't count. The update clarifies that drone/missile strikes entering Israeli airspace count even if intercepted.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources (like [2], [9], [10], [17], [30], [41], [44], [58]) mention Iran launching over 100 drones towards Israel on June 13. The IDF intercepted these drones outside Israeli territory, some over Saudi Arabia and Jordan. For example, source [10] states that the IDF intercepted drones beyond Israeli airspace, with some intercepted by Jordan. Source [30] says the drones were intercepted outside Israel's borders. \n\nThe critical question is whether any of these drones entered Israeli airspace. The definition says that if they enter Israeli airspace, even if intercepted, it counts. However, if they were intercepted before entering, it doesn't. The search results consistently mention interception outside Israel, like over Jordan or Saudi Arabia. For instance, source [43] notes Jordan intercepted drones that entered its airspace en route to Israel. Source [10] and [30] mention interception in Saudi and Jordanian airspace. \n\nThere's no mention in the provided sources of any Iranian drones successfully entering Israeli airspace. All reports indicate interception occurred outside Israel. Therefore, according to the market's rules, since the drones didn't enter Israeli airspace, the action doesn't qualify. Even though Iran launched the drones, they were intercepted before reaching Israeli territory. \n\nAdditionally, the market requires the action to be between June 11 and June 30. The events here are on June 13, which is within the timeframe. However, since the drones didn't enter Israeli airspace, the answer should be No (p1). The user's update also specifies that attempted strikes not entering airspace don't count. \n\nI should also check if there were any other actions by Iran within the timeframe. The search results focus on the June 13 events. No other military actions by Iran on Israeli soil, airspace, etc., are mentioned. All sources point to the drone attack being the main event, which was intercepted outside Israel. \n\nTherefore, based on the evidence, the resolution should be p2: No.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe market resolves to \"No\" (p1) because while Iran launched over 100 drones toward Israel on June 13, 2025, in retaliation for Israeli strikes, **all were intercepted outside Israeli airspace** (e.g., over Jordan or Saudi Arabia)[10][30][43]. Per the resolution rules, only strikes **entering Israeli airspace** qualify, even if intercepted. Since no Iranian drones or missiles breached Israeli airspace or territory, and no other Iranian military actions against Israeli soil/embassies occurred between June 11\u201330, the criteria for \"Yes\" (p2) are unmet.\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.998, ID: 88052052043979100337158336101202135164717634915166708959127722363565168662720, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.002, ID: 89219959664314627093511382092426771396709515780567809675635401346343802179784, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.998 = 99.8% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The user is asking whether Iran initiated a military action on Israeli soil, airspace, maritime territory, or any official Israeli embassy or consulate between June 11 and June 30, 2025, based on the provided ancillary data and resolution conditions. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if such an action occurred, \"No\" (p1) if not, and p3 if uncertain.\n\nFirst, I need to review the search results to determine if Iran carried out any military actions against Israel within the specified timeframe. The key points from the search results are:\n\n1. On June 13, 2025, Israel conducted a large-scale military operation called \"Operation Rising Lion\" against Iran, targeting nuclear facilities, military installations, and senior officials. This is detailed in sources [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [8], [11], [12], [16], [17], [18].\n\n2. In response to these Israeli strikes, Iran launched over 100 drones towards Israel. Sources [2], [4], [6], [9], [10], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18] confirm this. The IDF intercepted most of these drones outside Israeli airspace, but some entered Israeli airspace before being intercepted. For example, source [12] mentions that the IDF intercepted drones on the Syrian border, and [17] notes that the Home Front Command initially ordered civilians to stay near shelters, indicating that some drones entered Israeli airspace.\n\n3. The user's update clarifies that drone and missile strikes entering Israeli airspace qualify as a military action, even if intercepted. Therefore, the interception doesn't negate the qualification if the drones entered Israeli airspace.\n\n4. The ancillary data specifies that only actions by Iranian forces explicitly claimed by Iran or confirmed to originate from Iranian territory count. The search results indicate that Iran officially acknowledged the drone strikes as retaliation, with Supreme Leader Khamenei vowing retaliation [1][4][9][16]. The drones were launched from Iranian territory, as per sources [2][16][18].\n\n5. The market's time frame is June 11 to June 30, 2025. The events in question occurred on June 13, 2025, which falls within this window.\n\n6. The resolution conditions exclude proxy forces, but the drones were launched directly by Iran, not proxies, as stated in multiple sources.\n\nConsidering all this, Iran's drone strikes on June 13, 2025, which entered Israeli airspace, meet the criteria for a \"Yes\" resolution (p2). Even though most drones were intercepted, the fact that they entered Israeli airspace is sufficient per the user's update. Additionally, the Iranian government acknowledged the retaliation, fulfilling the requirement for official acknowledgment.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.

Consider potential events or developments not covered in the initial analysis.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking whether Iran initiated a military action on Israeli soil, airspace, maritime territory, or any official Israeli embassy or consulate between June 11 and June 30, 2025, based on the provided ancillary data and resolution conditions. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if such an action occurred, \"No\" (p1) if not, and p3 if uncertain.\n\nFirst, I need to review the search results to determine if Iran carried out any military actions against Israel within the specified timeframe. The key points from the search results are:\n\n1. On June 13, 2025, Israel conducted a large-scale military operation called \"Operation Rising Lion\" against Iran, targeting nuclear facilities, military installations, and senior officials. This is detailed in sources [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [8], [11], [12], [16], [17], [18].\n\n2. In response to these Israeli strikes, Iran launched over 100 drones towards Israel. Sources [2], [4], [6], [9], [10], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18] confirm this. The IDF intercepted most of these drones outside Israeli airspace, but some entered Israeli airspace before being intercepted. For example, source [12] mentions that the IDF intercepted drones on the Syrian border, and [17] notes that the Home Front Command initially ordered civilians to stay near shelters, indicating that some drones entered Israeli airspace.\n\n3. The user's update clarifies that drone and missile strikes entering Israeli airspace qualify as a military action, even if intercepted. Therefore, the interception doesn't negate the qualification if the drones entered Israeli airspace.\n\n4. The ancillary data specifies that only actions by Iranian forces explicitly claimed by Iran or confirmed to originate from Iranian territory count. The search results indicate that Iran officially acknowledged the drone strikes as retaliation, with Supreme Leader Khamenei vowing retaliation [1][4][9][16]. The drones were launched from Iranian territory, as per sources [2][16][18].\n\n5. The market's time frame is June 11 to June 30, 2025. The events in question occurred on June 13, 2025, which falls within this window.\n\n6. The resolution conditions exclude proxy forces, but the drones were launched directly by Iran, not proxies, as stated in multiple sources.\n\nConsidering all this, Iran's drone strikes on June 13, 2025, which entered Israeli airspace, meet the criteria for a \"Yes\" resolution (p2). Even though most drones were intercepted, the fact that they entered Israeli airspace is sufficient per the user's update. Additionally, the Iranian government acknowledged the retaliation, fulfilling the requirement for official acknowledgment.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.998, ID: 88052052043979100337158336101202135164717634915166708959127722363565168662720, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.002, ID: 89219959664314627093511382092426771396709515780567809675635401346343802179784, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.998 = 99.8% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
