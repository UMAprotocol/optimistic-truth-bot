Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality.

Recommendation found: p3.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p3\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.99, ID: 48239187162179184616220805515469395819272383366819163847040883000439042134996, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.01, ID: 111897236122562619582799393005561221050268721706401092633193230117278072520063, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.990 = 99.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The close \u00c2\u00ab\u00c2\u00a0C\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00bb and open \u00c2\u00ab\u00c2\u00a0O\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00bb displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance SOL/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets. market_id: 553229\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750357579 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-19 18:26:19 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p3. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Configure logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nconsole_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\nconsole_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nconsole_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\nlogger.addHandler(console_handler)\n\ndef get_solana_price(date_str, hour=13, minute=0, timezone_str=\"US/Eastern\"):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches the open and close price for the SOL/USDT 1 Hour candle on Binance\n    at a specific time on a given date.\n\n    Args:\n        date_str: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format\n        hour: Hour in 24-hour format (default: 13 for 1 PM ET)\n        minute: Minute (default: 0)\n        timezone_str: Timezone string (default: \"US/Eastern\")\n\n    Returns:\n        Tuple of (open_price, close_price)\n    \"\"\"\n    logger.info(f\"Fetching SOL/USDT price for {date_str} at {hour}:{minute} {timezone_str}\")\n    \n    # Convert the target time to UTC timestamp\n    tz = pytz.timezone(timezone_str)\n    time_str = f\"{hour:02d}:{minute:02d}:00\"\n    target_time_local = tz.localize(\n        datetime.strptime(f\"{date_str} {time_str}\", \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n    )\n    target_time_utc = target_time_local.astimezone(timezone.utc)\n    start_time_ms = int(target_time_utc.timestamp() * 1000) - 3600000  # 1 hour candle start time\n\n    # Binance API endpoint\n    api_url = \"https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines\"\n    params = {\n        \"symbol\": \"SOLUSDT\",\n        \"interval\": \"1h\",\n        \"limit\": 1,\n        \"startTime\": start_time_ms,\n        \"endTime\": start_time_ms + 3600000  # 1 hour duration\n    }\n\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(api_url, params=params)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n        \n        if data:\n            open_price = float(data[0][1])\n            close_price = float(data[0][4])\n            logger.info(f\"Successfully retrieved open price: {open_price} and close price: {close_price}\")\n            return (open_price, close_price)\n        else:\n            logger.error(\"No data returned from Binance API\")\n            return None\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        logger.error(f\"API request failed: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to handle the resolution of the Solana price movement market.\n    \"\"\"\n    date_str = \"2025-06-19\"  # Date of the event\n    prices = get_solana_price(date_str)\n    \n    if prices:\n        open_price, close_price = prices\n        if close_price >= open_price:\n            print(\"recommendation: p2\")  # Market resolves to \"Up\"\n        else:\n            print(\"recommendation: p1\")  # Market resolves to \"Down\"\n    else:\n        print(\"recommendation: p3\")  # Unknown/50-50 if no data could be retrieved\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p3\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.990 = 99.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nWe are given a query about the Solana (SOL) price movement on Binance for a specific 1-hour candle on June 19, 2025, starting at 1 PM ET (which is 17:00 UTC). The market will resolve to \"Up\" if the close price (C) is greater than or equal to the open price (O) for that candle. Otherwise, it resolves to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source is the Binance SOL/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/SOL_USDT). We are to use the open and close prices displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle once the data is finalized.\n\nGiven the current time is 2025-06-19 18:26:19 UTC (as per the Unix timestamp 1750357579), the candle in question (starting at 17:00 UTC) has already occurred and the data should be available.\n\nWe have a set of search results that include various sources of SOL price data. However, we are specifically instructed to use Binance as the source. We must look for the open and close prices for the 1-hour candle starting at 17:00 UTC on June 19, 2025.\n\nSteps:\n1. Convert the time of the candle to UTC: The candle starts at 1 PM ET on June 19, 2025. ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, so 1 PM ET is 17:00 UTC.\n2. The candle is from 17:00 to 18:00 UTC on June 19, 2025.\n3. We need the open price (at 17:00 UTC) and the close price (at 18:00 UTC) for the SOL/USDT pair on Binance.\n\nFrom the search results, we have:\n- [10] Binance Spot SOL/USDT page: https://www.binance.com/en/trade/SOL_USDT. This is the direct source.\n- However, the search results do not provide a direct table of historical 1-hour candles. We must rely on the data available in the search results or use the provided data to infer.\n\nLooking at the search results, we have:\n- [1] Binance SOL price page: Gives the current price but not historical candles.\n- [2] Investing.com historical data: Daily data, not hourly.\n- [3] TradingView SOL/USDT: Current price and some historical data but not the specific candle.\n- [4] Binance Square post: A technical analysis for SOL/USDT on 2025-04-24, not our date.\n- [5] TabTrader: Current price and volume.\n- [6] Blockchain.news: Mentions SOL price on June 19, 2025, at 10:00 AM UTC and 11:00 AM UTC, but not 17:00.\n- [7] CoinMarketCap SOL to USDT: Daily historical rates, not hourly.\n- [8] CoinMarketCap Solana page: Daily data.\n- [9] Binance Futures SOLUSDT: Not spot and not the specific candle.\n- [10] Binance Spot SOL/USDT: This is the source we need, but the search result snippet only shows the current price and 24h high/low, not the historical candle.\n\nWe note that the search results do not contain a direct table of the 1-hour candle for 17:00-18:00 UTC on June 19, 2025. However, we have:\n\n- [15] Blockchain.news flash news (same as [6] and [36]): It states that as of 10:00 AM UTC on June 19, 2025, SOL was trading at $145.32. Then at 11:00 AM UTC, the 24-hour volume on SOL/USDT on Binance was $850 million. But this is before our candle.\n\n- [36] Blockchain.news: \"Meanwhile, altcoins like Solana (SOL) saw a sharper decline of 5.1% to $132.40 as of 14:00 UTC on June 19, 2025\". This is at 14:00 UTC, which is before our candle (17:00 UTC). So we cannot use this for the 17:00 candle.\n\nGiven the lack of direct data in the search results for the specific candle, we must rely on the only source that provides hourly data: the Binance API. However, the search results do not contain the exact open and close for that hour.\n\nBut note: the query says the resolution source is the Binance SOL/USDT pair page. We are to use the open and close displayed at the top of the graph for that candle. Since we don't have a screenshot, we must look for data that might represent that.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the Binance API to get the kline for that hour. However, the search results do not contain the exact API response for that hour. But we do have:\n\n- [55] Binance API documentation for Kline/Candlestick Data.\n- [56] Binance Data Collection for 1-hour candles: This is a link to the data files, but we don't have the file for June 19, 2025.\n- [57] A GitHub issue about Binance klines: Indicates that the API returns UTC timestamps.\n- [58] Binance API overview.\n- [59] python-binance documentation.\n- [60] Websocket Kline/Candlestick Streams: But we don't have the stream data.\n- [61] ccxt binance.py: Code for the Binance API.\n- [62] Binance Data for 1-minute candles: We could aggregate to 1-hour, but we don't have the file.\n\nGiven the constraints, we must look for any data in the search results that might give us the open and close for the 17:00-18:00 UTC hour.\n\nLooking at [7] and [22] (CoinMarketCap SOL to USDT rate history), we have daily data for June 19, 2025: 143.89 USDT (closing at 00:00 UTC the next day). But we need hourly.\n\n[33] CoinMarketCap SOL to USDT: Same daily data.\n\n[28] CoinMarketCap: Same.\n\nWe also have [15] and [36] which give prices at specific times but not the open and close for the hour.\n\nAnother approach: The current time in the system is 2025-06-19 18:26:19 UTC. The candle we are interested in (17:00-18:00) has just ended (at 18:00 UTC). The close price would be the price at 18:00:00, and the open price at 17:00:00.\n\nIn the search results, we have [10] from Binance Spot, which shows the current price as 143.98 (at the time of the search result snapshot). But we don't know when that snapshot was taken.\n\nGiven the lack of direct data, we must consider the following:\n\nThe query states: \"The close \u00ab C \u00bb and open \u00ab O \u00bb displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant '1H' candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\"\n\nSince we don't have access to the Binance page at the exact time, we must rely on the data we have.\n\nHowever, we have [6] and [15] from Blockchain.news, which states:\n\n\"As of 10:00 AM UTC on June 19, 2025, Solana's native token, SOL, was trading at approximately $145.32 on major exchanges like Binance\"\n\nand\n\n\"SOL broke above $140 resistance at 08:00 AM UTC on June 19, 2025\"\n\nBut these are not for our hour.\n\nWe also have [36] which says at 14:00 UTC, SOL was at $132.40 (a 5.1% decline). But that is at 14:00, three hours before our candle.\n\nGiven the absence of the exact data, we must look for the most recent data in the search results that falls within the hour.\n\nWe have [1] which says the live price of Solana is $144.92 (as of the snapshot time). But we don't know when that snapshot was taken.\n\nSimilarly, [3] says the current price is 144.34 USDT (as of the snapshot).\n\n[5] says Solana price today is $148.940 (but then updated to $154.080).\n\n[12] says 1 Solana currently costs $144.92.\n\nBut none of these are for the specific hour.\n\nGiven the challenge, we note that the market resolution depends on the Binance data for that specific candle. Since we don't have the exact numbers, we must use the best available source that provides historical hourly data.\n\nHowever, the search results do not contain the hourly candle for 17:00-18:00. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine the open and close.\n\nBut wait: the current time in the system is 18:26:19 UTC, which is after the candle (which ended at 18:00). The data should be available. However, the search results were generated before the candle closed? Actually, the search results were generated at the time of the query, which is after the candle.\n\nLooking at the search results, we have:\n\n[7] CoinMarketCap: SOL to USDT rate for June 19, 2025: 143.89 USDT (which is the daily close at 00:00 UTC the next day). Not helpful.\n\n[22] Same as [7].\n\n[28] Same.\n\nWe also have [15] and [36] which are from Blockchain.news and mention prices at specific times, but not the open and close for the hour.\n\nGiven the constraints, we must look for any data that might be from the hour in question.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the Binance API to fetch the candle. However, the instructions say we must use the provided search results. We are not allowed to make live API calls.\n\nTherefore, we must conclude that the search results do not contain the required data for the 17:00-18:00 UTC candle on June 19, 2025. In this case, we cannot resolve the market and must return p3 (unknown/50-50) as per the ancillary data.\n\nBut note: the ancillary data says:\n  p1: Down\n  p2: Up\n  p3: unknown/50-50\n\nHowever, we are instructed: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nBut we don't have the data, so we cannot determine the most probable outcome. Therefore, we must return p3.\n\nBut let's double-check: the event (the 1-hour candle) has occurred (it's 18:26 UTC, so after 18:00). We just don't have the data in the search results.\n\nTherefore, the resolution is p3.\n\nHowever, we must be cautious: the query says the resolution source is Binance. We are to use the open and close displayed on the graph. Since we don't have that, we cannot verify.\n\nBut note: the search results include [10] which is the Binance Spot page. The snippet for [10] says:\n  \"143.98 | SOL USDT | Solana to USDT \u2013 Binance Spot\n  SOL/USDT ; 24h High. 147.92 ; 24h Low. 142.92 ; 24h Vol(SOL). 2.66M ; 24h Vol(USDT). 386.70M.\"\n\nThis data is for the entire 24-hour period, not the specific hour.\n\nGiven the above, we have no choice but to return p3.\n\nBut wait: we have the current time and the candle time. The candle started at 17:00 UTC and ended at 18:00 UTC. We are at 18:26 UTC, so the candle is closed. The data should be available on Binance, but it is not in the search results.\n\nTherefore, we must return p3.\n\nHowever, let's check if there is any data in the search results that might be from that hour.\n\nWe have [36] which says at 14:00 UTC the price was $132.40, and then at 18:26 (the current time) we are at $143.64 (from [8]) or $144.92 (from [1]). But we don't have the price at 17:00 and 18:00.\n\nAlternatively, we can look at the historical data tables. For example, [2] has a table of daily data, but that's daily.\n\n[4] has a table for hourly data but for a different date.\n\nGiven the above, we must conclude that the required data is not available in the search results.\n\nTherefore, the resolution is p3.\n\nBut note: the personalization instructions say: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\"\n\nThe user prompt does not contain a URL, but the description of the market says the resolution source is Binance (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/SOL_USDT). However, that URL is not in the search results. The search results do contain [10] which is the same URL, but the snippet does not have the historical candle.\n\nTherefore, we cannot get the data from the provided search results.\n\nFinal decision: We cannot verify the open and close for the candle, so we return p3.\n\nBut note: the market description says the candle begins on the time and date specified. The candle has occurred, but we don't have the data. So we must return p3.\n\nHowever, let's re-read the personalization: \"If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nWe have no verifiable information about the outcome (the open and close for that hour). Therefore, we must assume the most probable outcome. But what is the most probable outcome? We don't have any data to base it on.\n\nThe ancillary data says p3 is for unknown/50-50. So that is the fallback.\n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p3.\n\nBut note: the market is about the price movement in that specific hour. Without data, we cannot assume it was up or down. So p3 is appropriate.\n\nConclusion: We recommend p3.\n</think>\n### Analysis of Solana (SOL) Price Movement for June 19, 2025, 17:00 UTC\n\nThe query requires determining whether the SOL/USDT 1-hour candle on Binance (beginning at 17:00 UTC on June 19, 2025) closed higher or lower than its open price. The resolution depends on Binance's official data for the SOL/USDT pair, with \"Up\" (p2) if the close \u2265 open, and \"Down\" (p1) otherwise. The current timestamp is 2025-06-19 18:26:19 UTC, meaning the candle (17:00\u201318:00 UTC) has concluded, and data should be finalized.\n\n#### Key Observations from Search Results:\n1. **Binance Spot Data (Source [10])**:  \n   - Direct link to SOL/USDT trading pair on Binance is the primary resolution source.  \n   - At the time of data retrieval, the 24-hour high was 147.92 USDT and low was 142.92 USDT, but **no specific open/close for the 17:00\u201318:00 UTC candle is provided in the search results**.\n\n2. **Price Trends on June 19, 2025**:  \n   - SOL showed volatility throughout the day:  \n     - **10:00 AM UTC**: $145.32 ([6][15]).  \n     - **14:00 UTC**: Sharp decline to $132.40 ([36]).  \n     - **18:26 UTC (current time)**: Prices fluctuated between $143.58\u2013$147.84 ([9][10]).  \n   - However, these snapshots do not directly report the 17:00 open or 18:00 close.\n\n3. **Technical Indicators**:  \n   - Resistance at $150 and support at $140\u2013$145 were noted ([6][13]).  \n   - Neutral-to-bearish momentum prevailed, with RSI near oversold levels ([11][36]).\n\n4. **Data Gaps**:  \n   - Search results lack explicit open/close values for the 17:00\u201318:00 UTC candle.  \n   - Binance API/historical kline data ([55][60]) is referenced but not included in the provided context.\n\n#### Resolution Recommendation:\n- **p3 (Unknown/50-50)**:  \n  The search results contain no verifiable open/close prices for the specified candle. While the event occurred in the past, the exact values from Binance\u2019s graph are absent in the context.

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750357579 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-19 18:26:19 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nWe are given a query about the Solana (SOL) price movement on Binance for a specific 1-hour candle on June 19, 2025, starting at 1 PM ET (which is 17:00 UTC). The market will resolve to \"Up\" if the close price (C) is greater than or equal to the open price (O) for that candle. Otherwise, it resolves to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source is the Binance SOL/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/SOL_USDT). We are to use the open and close prices displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle once the data is finalized.\n\nGiven the current time is 2025-06-19 18:26:19 UTC (as per the Unix timestamp 1750357579), the candle in question (starting at 17:00 UTC) has already occurred and the data should be available.\n\nWe have a set of search results that include various sources of SOL price data. However, we are specifically instructed to use Binance as the source. We must look for the open and close prices for the 1-hour candle starting at 17:00 UTC on June 19, 2025.\n\nSteps:\n1. Convert the time of the candle to UTC: The candle starts at 1 PM ET on June 19, 2025. ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, so 1 PM ET is 17:00 UTC.\n2. The candle is from 17:00 to 18:00 UTC on June 19, 2025.\n3. We need the open price (at 17:00 UTC) and the close price (at 18:00 UTC) for the SOL/USDT pair on Binance.\n\nFrom the search results, we have:\n- [10] Binance Spot SOL/USDT page: https://www.binance.com/en/trade/SOL_USDT. This is the direct source.\n- However, the search results do not provide a direct table of historical 1-hour candles. We must rely on the data available in the search results or use the provided data to infer.\n\nLooking at the search results, we have:\n- [1] Binance SOL price page: Gives the current price but not historical candles.\n- [2] Investing.com historical data: Daily data, not hourly.\n- [3] TradingView SOL/USDT: Current price and some historical data but not the specific candle.\n- [4] Binance Square post: A technical analysis for SOL/USDT on 2025-04-24, not our date.\n- [5] TabTrader: Current price and volume.\n- [6] Blockchain.news: Mentions SOL price on June 19, 2025, at 10:00 AM UTC and 11:00 AM UTC, but not 17:00.\n- [7] CoinMarketCap SOL to USDT: Daily historical rates, not hourly.\n- [8] CoinMarketCap Solana page: Daily data.\n- [9] Binance Futures SOLUSDT: Not spot and not the specific candle.\n- [10] Binance Spot SOL/USDT: This is the source we need, but the search result snippet only shows the current price and 24h high/low, not the historical candle.\n\nWe note that the search results do not contain a direct table of the 1-hour candle for 17:00-18:00 UTC on June 19, 2025. However, we have:\n\n- [15] Blockchain.news flash news (same as [6] and [36]): It states that as of 10:00 AM UTC on June 19, 2025, SOL was trading at $145.32. Then at 11:00 AM UTC, the 24-hour volume on SOL/USDT on Binance was $850 million. But this is before our candle.\n\n- [36] Blockchain.news: \"Meanwhile, altcoins like Solana (SOL) saw a sharper decline of 5.1% to $132.40 as of 14:00 UTC on June 19, 2025\". This is at 14:00 UTC, which is before our candle (17:00 UTC). So we cannot use this for the 17:00 candle.\n\nGiven the lack of direct data in the search results for the specific candle, we must rely on the only source that provides hourly data: the Binance API. However, the search results do not contain the exact open and close for that hour.\n\nBut note: the query says the resolution source is the Binance SOL/USDT pair page. We are to use the open and close displayed at the top of the graph for that candle. Since we don't have a screenshot, we must look for data that might represent that.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the Binance API to get the kline for that hour. However, the search results do not contain the exact API response for that hour. But we do have:\n\n- [55] Binance API documentation for Kline/Candlestick Data.\n- [56] Binance Data Collection for 1-hour candles: This is a link to the data files, but we don't have the file for June 19, 2025.\n- [57] A GitHub issue about Binance klines: Indicates that the API returns UTC timestamps.\n- [58] Binance API overview.\n- [59] python-binance documentation.\n- [60] Websocket Kline/Candlestick Streams: But we don't have the stream data.\n- [61] ccxt binance.py: Code for the Binance API.\n- [62] Binance Data for 1-minute candles: We could aggregate to 1-hour, but we don't have the file.\n\nGiven the constraints, we must look for any data in the search results that might give us the open and close for the 17:00-18:00 UTC hour.\n\nLooking at [7] and [22] (CoinMarketCap SOL to USDT rate history), we have daily data for June 19, 2025: 143.89 USDT (closing at 00:00 UTC the next day). But we need hourly.\n\n[33] CoinMarketCap SOL to USDT: Same daily data.\n\n[28] CoinMarketCap: Same.\n\nWe also have [15] and [36] which give prices at specific times but not the open and close for the hour.\n\nAnother approach: The current time in the system is 2025-06-19 18:26:19 UTC. The candle we are interested in (17:00-18:00) has just ended (at 18:00 UTC). The close price would be the price at 18:00:00, and the open price at 17:00:00.\n\nIn the search results, we have [10] from Binance Spot, which shows the current price as 143.98 (at the time of the search result snapshot). But we don't know when that snapshot was taken.\n\nGiven the lack of direct data, we must consider the following:\n\nThe query states: \"The close \u00ab C \u00bb and open \u00ab O \u00bb displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant '1H' candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\"\n\nSince we don't have access to the Binance page at the exact time, we must rely on the data we have.\n\nHowever, we have [6] and [15] from Blockchain.news, which states:\n\n\"As of 10:00 AM UTC on June 19, 2025, Solana's native token, SOL, was trading at approximately $145.32 on major exchanges like Binance\"\n\nand\n\n\"SOL broke above $140 resistance at 08:00 AM UTC on June 19, 2025\"\n\nBut these are not for our hour.\n\nWe also have [36] which says at 14:00 UTC, SOL was at $132.40 (a 5.1% decline). But that is at 14:00, three hours before our candle.\n\nGiven the absence of the exact data, we must look for the most recent data in the search results that falls within the hour.\n\nWe have [1] which says the live price of Solana is $144.92 (as of the snapshot time). But we don't know when that snapshot was taken.\n\nSimilarly, [3] says the current price is 144.34 USDT (as of the snapshot).\n\n[5] says Solana price today is $148.940 (but then updated to $154.080).\n\n[12] says 1 Solana currently costs $144.92.\n\nBut none of these are for the specific hour.\n\nGiven the challenge, we note that the market resolution depends on the Binance data for that specific candle. Since we don't have the exact numbers, we must use the best available source that provides historical hourly data.\n\nHowever, the search results do not contain the hourly candle for 17:00-18:00. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine the open and close.\n\nBut wait: the current time in the system is 18:26:19 UTC, which is after the candle (which ended at 18:00). The data should be available. However, the search results were generated before the candle closed? Actually, the search results were generated at the time of the query, which is after the candle.\n\nLooking at the search results, we have:\n\n[7] CoinMarketCap: SOL to USDT rate for June 19, 2025: 143.89 USDT (which is the daily close at 00:00 UTC the next day). Not helpful.\n\n[22] Same as [7].\n\n[28] Same.\n\nWe also have [15] and [36] which are from Blockchain.news and mention prices at specific times, but not the open and close for the hour.\n\nGiven the constraints, we must look for any data that might be from the hour in question.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the Binance API to fetch the candle. However, the instructions say we must use the provided search results. We are not allowed to make live API calls.\n\nTherefore, we must conclude that the search results do not contain the required data for the 17:00-18:00 UTC candle on June 19, 2025. In this case, we cannot resolve the market and must return p3 (unknown/50-50) as per the ancillary data.\n\nBut note: the ancillary data says:\n  p1: Down\n  p2: Up\n  p3: unknown/50-50\n\nHowever, we are instructed: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nBut we don't have the data, so we cannot determine the most probable outcome. Therefore, we must return p3.\n\nBut let's double-check: the event (the 1-hour candle) has occurred (it's 18:26 UTC, so after 18:00). We just don't have the data in the search results.\n\nTherefore, the resolution is p3.\n\nHowever, we must be cautious: the query says the resolution source is Binance. We are to use the open and close displayed on the graph. Since we don't have that, we cannot verify.\n\nBut note: the search results include [10] which is the Binance Spot page. The snippet for [10] says:\n  \"143.98 | SOL USDT | Solana to USDT \u2013 Binance Spot\n  SOL/USDT ; 24h High. 147.92 ; 24h Low. 142.92 ; 24h Vol(SOL). 2.66M ; 24h Vol(USDT). 386.70M.\"\n\nThis data is for the entire 24-hour period, not the specific hour.\n\nGiven the above, we have no choice but to return p3.\n\nBut wait: we have the current time and the candle time. The candle started at 17:00 UTC and ended at 18:00 UTC. We are at 18:26 UTC, so the candle is closed. The data should be available on Binance, but it is not in the search results.\n\nTherefore, we must return p3.\n\nHowever, let's check if there is any data in the search results that might be from that hour.\n\nWe have [36] which says at 14:00 UTC the price was $132.40, and then at 18:26 (the current time) we are at $143.64 (from [8]) or $144.92 (from [1]). But we don't have the price at 17:00 and 18:00.\n\nAlternatively, we can look at the historical data tables. For example, [2] has a table of daily data, but that's daily.\n\n[4] has a table for hourly data but for a different date.\n\nGiven the above, we must conclude that the required data is not available in the search results.\n\nTherefore, the resolution is p3.\n\nBut note: the personalization instructions say: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\"\n\nThe user prompt does not contain a URL, but the description of the market says the resolution source is Binance (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/SOL_USDT). However, that URL is not in the search results. The search results do contain [10] which is the same URL, but the snippet does not have the historical candle.\n\nTherefore, we cannot get the data from the provided search results.\n\nFinal decision: We cannot verify the open and close for the candle, so we return p3.\n\nBut note: the market description says the candle begins on the time and date specified. The candle has occurred, but we don't have the data. So we must return p3.\n\nHowever, let's re-read the personalization: \"If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nWe have no verifiable information about the outcome (the open and close for that hour). Therefore, we must assume the most probable outcome. But what is the most probable outcome? We don't have any data to base it on.\n\nThe ancillary data says p3 is for unknown/50-50. So that is the fallback.\n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p3.\n\nBut note: the market is about the price movement in that specific hour. Without data, we cannot assume it was up or down. So p3 is appropriate.\n\nConclusion: We recommend p3.\n</think>\n### Analysis of Solana (SOL) Price Movement for June 19, 2025, 17:00 UTC\n\nThe query requires determining whether the SOL/USDT 1-hour candle on Binance (beginning at 17:00 UTC on June 19, 2025) closed higher or lower than its open price. The resolution depends on Binance's official data for the SOL/USDT pair, with \"Up\" (p2) if the close \u2265 open, and \"Down\" (p1) otherwise. The current timestamp is 2025-06-19 18:26:19 UTC, meaning the candle (17:00\u201318:00 UTC) has concluded, and data should be finalized.\n\n#### Key Observations from Search Results:\n1. **Binance Spot Data (Source [10])**:  \n   - Direct link to SOL/USDT trading pair on Binance is the primary resolution source.  \n   - At the time of data retrieval, the 24-hour high was 147.92 USDT and low was 142.92 USDT, but **no specific open/close for the 17:00\u201318:00 UTC candle is provided in the search results**.\n\n2. **Price Trends on June 19, 2025**:  \n   - SOL showed volatility throughout the day:  \n     - **10:00 AM UTC**: $145.32 ([6][15]).  \n     - **14:00 UTC**: Sharp decline to $132.40 ([36]).  \n     - **18:26 UTC (current time)**: Prices fluctuated between $143.58\u2013$147.84 ([9][10]).  \n   - However, these snapshots do not directly report the 17:00 open or 18:00 close.\n\n3. **Technical Indicators**:  \n   - Resistance at $150 and support at $140\u2013$145 were noted ([6][13]).  \n   - Neutral-to-bearish momentum prevailed, with RSI near oversold levels ([11][36]).\n\n4. **Data Gaps**:  \n   - Search results lack explicit open/close values for the 17:00\u201318:00 UTC candle.  \n   - Binance API/historical kline data ([55][60]) is referenced but not included in the provided context.\n\n#### Resolution Recommendation:\n- **p3 (Unknown/50-50)**:  \n  The search results contain no verifiable open/close prices for the specified candle. While the event occurred in the past, the exact values from Binance\u2019s graph are absent in the context. Per the ancillary data, unresolved queries default to p3 when source data is unavailable. \n\n**recommendation: p3**\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.99, ID: 48239187162179184616220805515469395819272383366819163847040883000439042134996, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.01, ID: 111897236122562619582799393005561221050268721706401092633193230117278072520063, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.990 = 99.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The market will resolve to \"Up\" (p2) if the close price is greater than or equal to the open price, and \"Down\" (p1) otherwise.\n\nThe current time is 2025-06-19 18:26:19 UTC, which is after the candle in question (17:00 UTC). Therefore, the candle has closed and we should have the data.\n\nWe have search results that include multiple sources for SOL/USDT price data. However, the resolution source is specified as Binance (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/SOL_USDT). We must use the open and close from the 1-hour candle starting at 17:00 UTC (which would be the candle from 17:00 to 18:00 UTC).\n\nLooking at the search results, we have:\n\n- [1] TradingView: Current price of SOL/USDT is 143.39 USDT (as of the time of the page, but we need the specific candle).\n- [2] Binance post from 2025-04-24: Not relevant for the specific time.\n- [3] CoinMarketCap: Provides historical data for SOL to USDT.

We need hourly.\n- [4] TabTrader: Shows Solana price today as $154.080, but this is for USD, not USDT, and not the specific hour.\n- [5] CoinMarketCap (Solana page): Live price is $143.64, but again, not the specific hour.\n- [6] Cex.io: Conversion rates, but not the specific hour.\n- [7] Revolut: SOL to USD, not USDT, and not the specific hour.\n- [8] Binance.US: Live price, but not the specific hour.\n- [9] Binance trade page: Current price 145.09, but we need the open and close for the 17:00-18:00 UTC candle.\n- [10] TradeSanta: Current rate 143.28, but again, not the specific hour.\n- [11] Python Binance documentation: Not relevant for price.\n- [12] Binance Solana page: General information, not the specific candle.\n- [13] CryptoDataDownload: Provides historical data, but we don't have a direct link to the hourly data for SOLUSDT on Binance.\n- [14] Binance.US: Same as [8].\n- [15] CoinMarketCap: Same as [5].\n- [16] CoinGecko: Binance statistics, not the specific data.\n- [17] CryptoDataDownload: Same as [13].\n- [18] Binance Solana page: Same as [12].\n- [19] Binance post: Same as [2].\n- [20] TradingView: Same as [1].\n- [21] Binance post: Trading data for SOL/USDT on 2025-03-07, not our date.\n- [22] Binance post: Analysis for 2025-05-15, not our date.\n- [23] Binance.US: Same as [8].\n- [24] CryptoDataDownload: General site.\n- [25] Investing.com: Historical data for Solana, but in USD and daily, not hourly.\n- [26] ChartExchange: Historical prices for SOLUSDT, but the table shows daily data, not hourly.\n- [27] CoinLore: Historical prices, daily.\n- [28] CoinLore: Price prediction, not historical.\n- [29] BitDegree: Historical chart, daily.\n- [30] Coinbase: Live price, not the specific hour.\n- [31] Binance Solana page: Same as [12].\n- [32] Binance price prediction: Not historical.\n- [33] TradingView ideas: Not data.\n- [34] Coinalyze: Live price chart and news, but we need the specific candle.\n- [35] TradingView: Same as [33].\n- [36] TradingView: Same.\n- [37] Binance data: This is a link to Binance data for BTCUSDT, not SOLUSDT.\n- [38] Binance trade page: Current price 143.98, but we need the open and close for the 17:00-18:00 UTC candle.\n- [39] Binance trade page (UK): 146.02, but again, current.\n- [40] TradingView: Same as [1].\n- [41] Binance futures: SOLUSDT perpetual, but we need spot for the resolution (as per the query, the source is the spot pair on Binance: https://www.binance.com/en/trade/SOL_USDT).\n- [42] Binance Solana page: Same.\n- [43] TradingView technicals: Not data.\n- [44] CryptoDataDownload: Same as [13].\n- [45] CryptoDataDownload: Same.\n- [46] QuantConnect: Documentation, not data.\n- [47] GitHub: Binance data, but not the specific data point.\n- [48] Bitget: Historical data, but daily.\n- [49] Binance Solana page: Same.\n- [50] Binance trade page: Current price 143.98.\n- [51] TradingView: Same.\n- [52] Binance futures: Same as [41].\n- [53] TradingView technicals: Same as [43].\n- [54] CryptoDataDownload: Same.\n\nNone of the search results provide the open and close for the specific 1-hour candle (17:00-18:00 UTC on 2025-06-19). However, we note that the current time is 18:26:19 UTC, which is after the candle closed (at 18:00 UTC). Therefore, the data should be available.\n\nGiven that the resolution source is Binance, we can try to reconstruct from the available data:\n\n- The candle in question is the 1-hour candle starting at 17:00 UTC and ending at 18:00 UTC.\n\nWe have the current price at 18:26 UTC (which is after the candle closed) from multiple sources:\n\n- [50] Binance trade page: 143.98 USDT (as of the time of the page load, which is not specified, but likely recent).\n- [38] Binance trade page: 143.98 USDT.\n\nBut we need the open at 17:00 and the close at 18:00.\n\nAlternatively, we can look for historical data in the search results. However, the only historical data we have is daily, not hourly.\n\nGiven the lack of direct hourly data in the search results, we must rely on the fact that the market resolution depends on Binance's data. Since we don't have the exact numbers, we might need to use an alternative approach.\n\nBut note: the query says the resolution source is Binance, and we are to use the open and close displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle. Since we don't have a screenshot of that exact candle, we must look for a source that provides historical hourly data.\n\nLooking again, we have:\n\n- [26] ChartExchange: Provides a table of historical data for SOLUSDT. The table shows data for 2025-06-18 and earlier, but not for today (2025-06-19) because it's not the end of the day.\n\n- [34] Coinalyze: Live chart and news, but no historical hourly data.\n\nGiven the constraints, we must note that the candle has closed and the data is available on Binance. However, without the exact numbers in the search results, we cannot definitively state the open and close.\n\nBut wait: the current time is 18:26 UTC, and the candle closed at 18:00 UTC. We have the current price (which is after the close) and we might be able to infer the close price from the fact that the candle has ended. However, we don't have the open.\n\nAlternative approach: We can use the price at 17:00 UTC and 18:00 UTC from a reliable source. Since the resolution source is Binance, we should use Binance data. We have the Binance trade page (result [50]) which shows the current price, but that is for the current moment, not the historical candle.\n\nWe also have the Binance API (result [11]) which we could use to get historical data, but we don't have an API key and we are not set up to make an API call.\n\nGiven the above, we must rely on the information available in the search results. Unfortunately, none of the search results provide the hourly open and close for the specific candle.\n\nHowever, we note that the market conditions in the ancillary data are clear: p1 for Down, p2 for Up. Without the data, we cannot be certain. But the query says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nIn this case, we have the event (the candle) in the past, but we don't have the data. Therefore, we must assume the most probable outcome? But what is the most probable outcome? The user prompt doesn't specify.\n\nAlternatively, we can look at the price movement during the day. We have:\n\n- From [3] CoinMarketCap: On Jun 19, 2025, the price was 143.89 USDT (at 00:00 UTC) and the 24h change was -1.66%. But this is daily, not hourly.\n\n- From [25] Investing.com: The table shows the price for Jun 19, 2025, but again, daily.\n\nGiven the lack of specific data, we must look for any source that might have recorded the hourly candle.\n\nLooking at [34] Coinalyze: They have a live price chart and news. The news items are from June 18 and 19, but no historical hourly data.\n\nAnother idea: We have the current price and the price at the time of the search results. But the search results were generated at the time of the query, which is 18:26 UTC. The candle closed at 18:00 UTC, so 26 minutes ago. We might be able to use the price at 18:00 UTC from a chart, but we don't have it.\n\nGiven the above, we are forced to conclude that we do not have the data in the search results to determine the open and close of the 17:00-18:00 UTC candle. Therefore, we must return p3 (unknown/50-50) as per the ancillary data (p3: 0.5).\n\nBut note: the query says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nWhat is the most probable outcome? The user prompt does not specify. Therefore, we cannot assume. Hence, we return p3.\n\nHowever, let's reexamine: the event (the candle) has occurred, and the data is available on Binance. We just don't have it in the search results. But the resolution source is Binance, and we are to use the data from Binance. Since we don't have it, we cannot verify.\n\nTherefore, we must return p3.\n\nBut note: the previous response returned p3 and we are asked to try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources.\n\nAlternative data source: We have the Binance trade page (result [50]) which shows the current price and a chart. If we could see the chart, we could get the candle. But the search result is a text snippet, not the chart.\n\nWe also have [38] Binance trade page: same issue.\n\nGiven the constraints, we cannot access the chart. Therefore, we must stick with p3.\n\nBut wait: the current time is 18:26 UTC, and the candle closed at 18:00 UTC. The close price at 18:00 UTC would be the last traded price at that time. We have the current price at 18:26 UTC, which is 143.98 USDT (from [50]). However, we don't have the price at 18:00 UTC.\n\nWe can try to estimate: the candle closed 26 minutes ago. The price now is 143.98. But without knowing the price movement in the last 26 minutes, we cannot know the close.\n\nTherefore, we are stuck.\n\nConclusion: We do not have the data to determine the outcome. We must return p3.\n\nHowever, let's note that the market is about the 1-hour candle on Binance. We have the open and close for the daily candle, but not for the hourly. We must return p3.\n\nBut the query says: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\"\n\nThe user prompt specifies the URL: https://www.binance.com/en/trade/SOL_USDT. We have this URL in the search results (result [50] and [38]). However, the search result for [50] is a snippet of the page, which only shows the current price and 24h high/low, not the historical candle.\n\nTherefore, we cannot extract the open and close for the specific candle from the provided search results.\n\nFinal decision: We return p3.\n\nrecommendation: p3\n</think>\nBased on the analysis of the provided search results and the specific conditions of the UMA optimistic oracle request, the resolution for the market \"Solana Up or Down - June 19, 1PM ET\" is determined as follows:\n\n### Key Findings:\n1. **Event Timing**: The market specified the SOL/USDT 1-hour candle starting at June 19, 2025, 1 PM ET (17:00 UTC) and ending at 18:00 UTC. The current timestamp is June 19, 2025, 18:26:19 UTC, confirming the event has concluded[1][3][5].\n\n2. **Resolution Source Requirement**: The query mandates using Binance's SOL/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/SOL_USDT) as the exclusive resolution source. The open (O) and close (C) prices from the 1-hour candle must be compared[1][3].\n\n3. **Data Availability**: \n   - Search results contain real-time SOL/USDT prices (e.g., $143.98 at Binance Spot as of snippet extraction)[38][50], but **no explicit open/close values for the 17:00-18:00 UTC candle are provided in the indexed data**.\n   - Historical tables (e.g., CoinMarketCap, CoinLore) only show daily aggregates, not hourly granularity[3][15][27].\n   - Binance API documentation exists[11], but no live query was executed due to system constraints.\n\n4. **Ancillary Data Conditions**: \n   - p1: Down (close < open)\n   - p2: Up (close \u2265 open)\n   - p3: Unknown/50-50 (if data is unavailable)[1].\n\n### Resolution:\n- **No verifiable open/close prices** for the 17:00-18:00 UTC candle were found within the provided sources. While the event occurred in the past, the specific Binance data required for resolution is absent from the search results[1][3][38][50].\n- Per the query's instructions, when outcome data is unavailable despite the event's completion, the recommendation defaults to **p3 (unknown/50-50)**[1].\n\n### Recommendation:\n`recommendation: p3`",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750357579 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-19 18:26:19 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p3. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nWe are given a query about a market that resolves based on the SOL/USDT 1-hour candle on Binance for June 19, 2025, at 1 PM ET (which is 17:00 UTC). The market will resolve to \"Up\" (p2) if the close price is greater than or equal to the open price, and \"Down\" (p1) otherwise.\n\nThe current time is 2025-06-19 18:26:19 UTC, which is after the candle in question (17:00 UTC). Therefore, the candle has closed and we should have the data.\n\nWe have search results that include multiple sources for SOL/USDT price data. However, the resolution source is specified as Binance (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/SOL_USDT). We must use the open and close from the 1-hour candle starting at 17:00 UTC (which would be the candle from 17:00 to 18:00 UTC).\n\nLooking at the search results, we have:\n\n- [1] TradingView: Current price of SOL/USDT is 143.39 USDT (as of the time of the page, but we need the specific candle).\n- [2] Binance post from 2025-04-24: Not relevant for the specific time.\n- [3] CoinMarketCap: Provides historical data for SOL to USDT.

Therefore, the data should be available.\n\nGiven that the resolution source is Binance, we can try to reconstruct from the available data:\n\n- The candle in question is the 1-hour candle starting at 17:00 UTC and ending at 18:00 UTC.\n\nWe have the current price at 18:26 UTC (which is after the candle closed) from multiple sources:\n\n- [50] Binance trade page: 143.98 USDT (as of the time of the page load, which is not specified, but likely recent).\n- [38] Binance trade page: 143.98 USDT.\n\nBut we need the open at 17:00 and the close at 18:00.\n\nAlternatively, we can look for historical data in the search results. However, the only historical data we have is daily, not hourly.\n\nGiven the lack of direct hourly data in the search results, we must rely on the fact that the market resolution depends on Binance's data. Since we don't have the exact numbers, we might need to use an alternative approach.\n\nBut note: the query says the resolution source is Binance, and we are to use the open and close displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle. Since we don't have a screenshot of that exact candle, we must look for a source that provides historical hourly data.\n\nLooking again, we have:\n\n- [26] ChartExchange: Provides a table of historical data for SOLUSDT. The table shows data for 2025-06-18 and earlier, but not for today (2025-06-19) because it's not the end of the day.\n\n- [34] Coinalyze: Live chart and news, but no historical hourly data.\n\nGiven the constraints, we must note that the candle has closed and the data is available on Binance. However, without the exact numbers in the search results, we cannot definitively state the open and close.\n\nBut wait: the current time is 18:26 UTC, and the candle closed at 18:00 UTC. We have the current price (which is after the close) and we might be able to infer the close price from the fact that the candle has ended. However, we don't have the open.\n\nAlternative approach: We can use the price at 17:00 UTC and 18:00 UTC from a reliable source. Since the resolution source is Binance, we should use Binance data. We have the Binance trade page (result [50]) which shows the current price, but that is for the current moment, not the historical candle.\n\nWe also have the Binance API (result [11]) which we could use to get historical data, but we don't have an API key and we are not set up to make an API call.\n\nGiven the above, we must rely on the information available in the search results. Unfortunately, none of the search results provide the hourly open and close for the specific candle.\n\nHowever, we note that the market conditions in the ancillary data are clear: p1 for Down, p2 for Up. Without the data, we cannot be certain. But the query says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nIn this case, we have the event (the candle) in the past, but we don't have the data. Therefore, we must assume the most probable outcome? But what is the most probable outcome? The user prompt doesn't specify.\n\nAlternatively, we can look at the price movement during the day. We have:\n\n- From [3] CoinMarketCap: On Jun 19, 2025, the price was 143.89 USDT (at 00:00 UTC) and the 24h change was -1.66%. But this is daily, not hourly.\n\n- From [25] Investing.com: The table shows the price for Jun 19, 2025, but again, daily.\n\nGiven the lack of specific data, we must look for any source that might have recorded the hourly candle.\n\nLooking at [34] Coinalyze: They have a live price chart and news. The news items are from June 18 and 19, but no historical hourly data.\n\nAnother idea: We have the current price and the price at the time of the search results. But the search results were generated at the time of the query, which is 18:26 UTC. The candle closed at 18:00 UTC, so 26 minutes ago. We might be able to use the price at 18:00 UTC from a chart, but we don't have it.\n\nGiven the above, we are forced to conclude that we do not have the data in the search results to determine the open and close of the 17:00-18:00 UTC candle. Therefore, we must return p3 (unknown/50-50) as per the ancillary data (p3: 0.5).\n\nBut note: the query says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nWhat is the most probable outcome? The user prompt does not specify. Therefore, we cannot assume. Hence, we return p3.\n\nHowever, let's reexamine: the event (the candle) has occurred, and the data is available on Binance. We just don't have it in the search results. But the resolution source is Binance, and we are to use the data from Binance. Since we don't have it, we cannot verify.\n\nTherefore, we must return p3.\n\nBut note: the previous response returned p3 and we are asked to try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources.\n\nAlternative data source: We have the Binance trade page (result [50]) which shows the current price and a chart. If we could see the chart, we could get the candle. But the search result is a text snippet, not the chart.\n\nWe also have [38] Binance trade page: same issue.\n\nGiven the constraints, we cannot access the chart. Therefore, we must stick with p3.\n\nBut wait: the current time is 18:26 UTC, and the candle closed at 18:00 UTC. The close price at 18:00 UTC would be the last traded price at that time. We have the current price at 18:26 UTC, which is 143.98 USDT (from [50]). However, we don't have the price at 18:00 UTC.\n\nWe can try to estimate: the candle closed 26 minutes ago. The price now is 143.98. But without knowing the price movement in the last 26 minutes, we cannot know the close.\n\nTherefore, we are stuck.\n\nConclusion: We do not have the data to determine the outcome. We must return p3.\n\nHowever, let's note that the market is about the 1-hour candle on Binance. We have the open and close for the daily candle, but not for the hourly. We must return p3.\n\nBut the query says: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\"\n\nThe user prompt specifies the URL: https://www.binance.com/en/trade/SOL_USDT. We have this URL in the search results (result [50] and [38]). However, the search result for [50] is a snippet of the page, which only shows the current price and 24h high/low, not the historical candle.\n\nTherefore, we cannot extract the open and close for the specific candle from the provided search results.\n\nFinal decision: We return p3.\n\nrecommendation: p3\n</think>\nBased on the analysis of the provided search results and the specific conditions of the UMA optimistic oracle request, the resolution for the market \"Solana Up or Down - June 19, 1PM ET\" is determined as follows:\n\n### Key Findings:\n1. **Event Timing**: The market specified the SOL/USDT 1-hour candle starting at June 19, 2025, 1 PM ET (17:00 UTC) and ending at 18:00 UTC. The current timestamp is June 19, 2025, 18:26:19 UTC, confirming the event has concluded[1][3][5].\n\n2. **Resolution Source Requirement**: The query mandates using Binance's SOL/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/SOL_USDT) as the exclusive resolution source. The open (O) and close (C) prices from the 1-hour candle must be compared[1][3].\n\n3. **Data Availability**: \n   - Search results contain real-time SOL/USDT prices (e.g., $143.98 at Binance Spot as of snippet extraction)[38][50], but **no explicit open/close values for the 17:00-18:00 UTC candle are provided in the indexed data**.\n   - Historical tables (e.g., CoinMarketCap, CoinLore) only show daily aggregates, not hourly granularity[3][15][27].\n   - Binance API documentation exists[11], but no live query was executed due to system constraints.\n\n4. **Ancillary Data Conditions**: \n   - p1: Down (close < open)\n   - p2: Up (close \u2265 open)\n   - p3: Unknown/50-50 (if data is unavailable)[1].\n\n### Resolution:\n- **No verifiable open/close prices** for the 17:00-18:00 UTC candle were found within the provided sources. While the event occurred in the past, the specific Binance data required for resolution is absent from the search results[1][3][38][50].\n- Per the query's instructions, when outcome data is unavailable despite the event's completion, the recommendation defaults to **p3 (unknown/50-50)**[1].\n\n### Recommendation:\n`recommendation: p3`\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.99, ID: 48239187162179184616220805515469395819272383366819163847040883000439042134996, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.01, ID: 111897236122562619582799393005561221050268721706401092633193230117278072520063, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.990 = 99.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Your task is to analyze the provided query and decide which AI solver is best suited to handle it.\n\nAvailable solvers: perplexity\n\nSolver descriptions:\n- perplexity: Uses the Perplexity AI search engine to find information online to answer general questions. Best for:\n  * Historical data and events\n  * General knowledge questions requiring context\n  * Questions needing interpretation of complex information\n  * Has knowledge cutoff and may not have very recent information\n\n- code_runner: Executes code to fetch real-time data from specific APIs. Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Currently available data sources based on API keys:\n    - MLB (Major League Baseball) data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Solana Up or Down - June 19, 1PM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the close price is greater than or equal to the open price for the SOL/USDT 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the SOL/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/SOL_USDT). The close \u00c2\u00ab\u00c2\u00a0C\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00bb and open \u00c2\u00ab\u00c2\u00a0O\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00bb displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance SOL/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets. market_id: 553229\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",

The code itself is structured to handle API data retrieval and decision logic correctly, but it failed to fetch the required data, leading to an inconclusive result. This failure could be due to API access issues, incorrect API parameters, or temporary unavailability of the data. The logic for determining the recommendation based on the fetched prices (if close_price >= open_price then p2 else p1) is correct, but without successful data retrieval, it defaults to p3, which is not justified given the market data.",
