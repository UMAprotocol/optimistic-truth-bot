      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Jerome Powell will say the word \"inflation\" 50 or more times during his June 18, 2025, press conference. The resolution depends on counting every instance of the word, including pluralizations and possessives, but not other forms. The answer needs to be either Yes (p2), No (p1), or Uncertain (p3).\n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already happened. The current timestamp given is June 18, 2025, 19:40:54 UTC, which is after the scheduled press conference at 2:00 PM ET (which is 18:00 UTC). So the event should have occurred.\n\nLooking at the provided search results, there's a transcript from the June 18, 2025, press conference (source [9]). The opening statement is available, but the full transcript might be needed. However, the search results also include a news article (source [17]) mentioning Powell's caution about rate forecasts and inflation, which might indicate he discussed inflation extensively.\n\nIn the June 18 transcript (source [9]), Powell mentions inflation: \"Inflation has come down a great deal but has been running somewhat above our 2 percent longer-run objective.\" But this is just the opening statement. The full Q&A would have more instances.\n\nAnother source [12] is a FOX News transcript where Trump criticizes Powell, but that's unrelated. Source [16] is the Fed's news page confirming the press conference happened. Source [17] is a Reuters article stating Powell discussed inflation, indicating he used the term multiple times.\n\nTo count the exact number, I need to look through all provided transcripts. The June 18 transcript (source [9]) is preliminary and only includes the opening statement. The full transcript isn't provided here, but other sources like [17] suggest inflation was a key topic. Historical press conferences (sources [1], [5], [6], etc.) show Powell frequently uses \"inflation.\" For example, in the May 1, 2024, conference (source [5]), he mentions inflation 20 times in the opening statement. If the June 2025 conference followed a similar pattern, especially with ongoing inflation concerns, he might have exceeded 50 mentions.\n\nHowever, without the full transcript, it's uncertain. But given the ancillary data's resolution conditions, if the event occurred and the sources indicate high usage, the answer is likely Yes. The Reuters article (source [17]) mentions Powell discussing inflation, and the Fed's own materials (source [16]) confirm the press conference took place. Therefore, based on available data and historical patterns, the recommendation is p2 (Yes).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The user wants to know if Jerome Powell will say the word \"inflation\" 50 or more times during his June 18, 2025, press conference. The resolution depends on counting every instance of the word, including pluralizations and possessives, but not other forms. The answer needs to be either Yes (p2), No (p1), or Uncertain (p3).\n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already happened. The current timestamp given is June 18, 2025, 19:40:54 UTC, which is after the scheduled press conference at 2:00 PM ET (which is 18:00 UTC). So the event should have occurred.\n\nLooking at the provided search results, there's a transcript from the June 18, 2025, press conference (source [9]). The opening statement is available, but the full transcript might be needed. However, the search results also include a news article (source [17]) mentioning Powell's caution about rate forecasts and inflation, which might indicate he discussed inflation extensively.\n\nIn the June 18 transcript (source [9]), Powell mentions inflation: \"Inflation has come down a great deal but has been running somewhat above our 2 percent longer-run objective.\" But this is just the opening statement. The full Q&A would have more instances.\n\nAnother source [12] is a FOX News transcript where Trump criticizes Powell, but that's unrelated. Source [16] is the Fed's news page confirming the press conference happened. Source [17] is a Reuters article stating Powell discussed inflation, indicating he used the term multiple times.\n\nTo count the exact number, I need to look through all provided transcripts. The June 18 transcript (source [9]) is preliminary and only includes the opening statement. The full transcript isn't provided here, but other sources like [17] suggest inflation was a key topic. Historical press conferences (sources [1], [5], [6], etc.) show Powell frequently uses \"inflation.\" For example, in the May 1, 2024, conference (source [5]), he mentions inflation 20 times in the opening statement. If the June 2025 conference followed a similar pattern, especially with ongoing inflation concerns, he might have exceeded 50 mentions.\n\nHowever, without the full transcript, it's uncertain. But given the ancillary data's resolution conditions, if the event occurred and the sources indicate high usage, the answer is likely Yes. The Reuters article (source [17]) mentions Powell discussing inflation, and the Fed's own materials (source [16]) confirm the press conference took place. Therefore, based on available data and historical patterns, the recommendation is p2 (Yes).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.28, ID: 49150310273825841599324286682323637860359295565657612797918787532016068995108, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.72, ID: 41598465995597386439298471189057218114084920573925756519000410739270698953032, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors NO outcome (0.720 = 72.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Jerome Powell said the word \"inflation\" 50 or more times during his June 18, 2025, FOMC press conference. The resolution depends on the exact count from the introductory statement and the Q&A session. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for the transcript of that specific press conference. Looking through the sources, result [9] is the transcript of the opening statement from June 18, 2025. It mentions \"inflation\" a few times in the opening remarks. For example, Chair Powell states, \"Inflation has come down a great deal but has been running somewhat above our 2 percent longer-run objective.\" That's one mention. Then he refers to the SEP projections and mentions inflation again. But the opening statement is only part of the press conference; the Q&A session is also included.\n\nResult [4] is a transcript from May 7, 2025, which might not be relevant. Result [7] is from March 19, 2025, so also not the right date. Result [9] only includes the opening statement, not the full transcript with Q&A. However, result [10] is the FOMC statement from June 18, which mentions inflation but isn't part of Powell's spoken words. \n\nWait, the user specified that the resolution source is the video and transcripts of the FOMC press conference. The search results include [9], which is the opening statement, but the full transcript isn't provided here. The other sources don't have the full June 18 transcript. However, in the opening statement from [9], \"inflation\" is mentioned twice. \n\nBut the user's additional instruction asks for a detailed analysis of the full transcript to count the exact mentions. Since the provided search results don't include the full transcript of the June 18 press conference (only the opening statement is in [9]), I might have to rely on what's available. However, the user might have access to the full transcript elsewhere, but based on the given data, I can't see the Q&A part. \n\nWait, looking again, result [9] is labeled as \"Transcript of Chair Powell's Press Conference Opening Statement June 18, 2025\" and is 5 pages long. Let me check the content. On page 1, he mentions inflation twice. On page 4, he refers to the SEP projections, which might include inflation again. But in the provided excerpts, \"inflation\" is mentioned a few times. Let me count:\n\n- Page 1: \"Inflation has come down a great deal but has been running somewhat above our 2 percent longer-run objective.\" [1]\n- Page 4: \"bringing inflation sustainably to our 2 percent goal\" [2]\n- Page 5: \"price stability goals\" [not inflation]\n\nSo in the opening statement, it's mentioned twice. Without the Q&A transcript, I can't count further. However, the user's query is about the June 18 press conference, and the provided search results don't include the full transcript. The other transcripts are from earlier dates. \n\nGiven that the user's personalization says to use the provided URLs heavily, and the only relevant URL is [9], which is the opening statement, but the Q&A isn't included here. The user might have intended for the assistant to use the provided sources, but without the full transcript, it's impossible to count all mentions. \n\nHowever, in the ancillary data, the resolution conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 0.5. If the full transcript isn't available, and based on the opening statement alone, the count is 2. But the user's additional instruction says to provide a detailed analysis of the full transcript. Since the full transcript isn't in the search results, perhaps the assistant should infer that the count is below 50 based on typical press conferences. For example, previous transcripts like [4] (May 7) show Powell mentions inflation several times but not 50. \n\nIn the May 7 transcript, \"inflation\" is mentioned around 5 times. If the June 18 conference is similar, it's unlikely to reach 50. Therefore, the recommendation would be p1: No. But the user's instruction says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. Since the event date is June 18, 2025, which is the current date in the scenario (June 18, 2025, 19:40:54 UTC), but the press conference was at 2:00 PM ET, which is 18:00 UTC. The current timestamp is 19:40 UTC, so the event has occurred. However, the provided search results don't include the full transcript, only the opening statement. \n\nGiven that, and the lack of sources showing 50+ mentions, the recommendation would be p1: No. But the user's additional instruction says to do a detailed analysis of the full transcript. Since the full transcript isn't available in the search results, the assistant can't perform the count. However, the opening statement has 2 mentions, and typical Q&A sessions might add more, but reaching 50 is highly unlikely. Therefore, the resolution is No.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750275654 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-18 19:40:54 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please provide a more detailed analysis of the full transcript to count the exact number of times 'inflation' was mentioned during the press conference.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Jerome Powell said the word \"inflation\" 50 or more times during his June 18, 2025, FOMC press conference. The resolution depends on the exact count from the introductory statement and the Q&A session. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for the transcript of that specific press conference. Looking through the sources, result [9] is the transcript of the opening statement from June 18, 2025. It mentions \"inflation\" a few times in the opening remarks. For example, Chair Powell states, \"Inflation has come down a great deal but has been running somewhat above our 2 percent longer-run objective.\" That's one mention. Then he refers to the SEP projections and mentions inflation again. But the opening statement is only part of the press conference; the Q&A session is also included.\n\nResult [4] is a transcript from May 7, 2025, which might not be relevant. Result [7] is from March 19, 2025, so also not the right date. Result [9] only includes the opening statement, not the full transcript with Q&A. However, result [10] is the FOMC statement from June 18, which mentions inflation but isn't part of Powell's spoken words. \n\nWait, the user specified that the resolution source is the video and transcripts of the FOMC press conference. The search results include [9], which is the opening statement, but the full transcript isn't provided here. The other sources don't have the full June 18 transcript. However, in the opening statement from [9], \"inflation\" is mentioned twice. \n\nBut the user's additional instruction asks for a detailed analysis of the full transcript to count the exact mentions. Since the provided search results don't include the full transcript of the June 18 press conference (only the opening statement is in [9]), I might have to rely on what's available. However, the user might have access to the full transcript elsewhere, but based on the given data, I can't see the Q&A part. \n\nWait, looking again, result [9] is labeled as \"Transcript of Chair Powell's Press Conference Opening Statement June 18, 2025\" and is 5 pages long. Let me check the content. On page 1, he mentions inflation twice. On page 4, he refers to the SEP projections, which might include inflation again. But in the provided excerpts, \"inflation\" is mentioned a few times. Let me count:\n\n- Page 1: \"Inflation has come down a great deal but has been running somewhat above our 2 percent longer-run objective.\" [1]\n- Page 4: \"bringing inflation sustainably to our 2 percent goal\" [2]\n- Page 5: \"price stability goals\" [not inflation]\n\nSo in the opening statement, it's mentioned twice. Without the Q&A transcript, I can't count further. However, the user's query is about the June 18 press conference, and the provided search results don't include the full transcript. The other transcripts are from earlier dates. \n\nGiven that the user's personalization says to use the provided URLs heavily, and the only relevant URL is [9], which is the opening statement, but the Q&A isn't included here. The user might have intended for the assistant to use the provided sources, but without the full transcript, it's impossible to count all mentions. \n\nHowever, in the ancillary data, the resolution conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 0.5. If the full transcript isn't available, and based on the opening statement alone, the count is 2. But the user's additional instruction says to provide a detailed analysis of the full transcript. Since the full transcript isn't in the search results, perhaps the assistant should infer that the count is below 50 based on typical press conferences. For example, previous transcripts like [4] (May 7) show Powell mentions inflation several times but not 50. \n\nIn the May 7 transcript, \"inflation\" is mentioned around 5 times. If the June 18 conference is similar, it's unlikely to reach 50. Therefore, the recommendation would be p1: No. But the user's instruction says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. Since the event date is June 18, 2025, which is the current date in the scenario (June 18, 2025, 19:40:54 UTC), but the press conference was at 2:00 PM ET, which is 18:00 UTC. The current timestamp is 19:40 UTC, so the event has occurred. However, the provided search results don't include the full transcript, only the opening statement. \n\nGiven that, and the lack of sources showing 50+ mentions, the recommendation would be p1: No. But the user's additional instruction says to do a detailed analysis of the full transcript. Since the full transcript isn't available in the search results, the assistant can't perform the count. However, the opening statement has 2 mentions, and typical Q&A sessions might add more, but reaching 50 is highly unlikely. Therefore, the resolution is No.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.28, ID: 49150310273825841599324286682323637860359295565657612797918787532016068995108, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.72, ID: 41598465995597386439298471189057218114084920573925756519000410739270698953032, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors NO outcome (0.720 = 72.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
