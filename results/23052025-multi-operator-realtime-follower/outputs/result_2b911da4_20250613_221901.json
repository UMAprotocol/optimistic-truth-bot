      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the MOUZ vs. Liquid match in the BLAST.tv Austin Major. The key here is to determine the outcome based on verified facts and the provided ancillary data.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The system mentions it's June 13, 2025, 22:15:07 UTC. The match is scheduled for June 13, 2025, at 16:00 ET, which is 20:00 UTC. Since the current time is 22:15 UTC, the match has already concluded. So, it's not a future event anymore.\n\nNext, I'll look through the search results to find the outcome of the MOUZ vs. Liquid match. The search results include multiple sources. For example, result [6] from esportsinsider.com mentions that both MOUZ and Liquid are 0-2 and will face each other in an elimination match. However, this is from June 13, 2025, but doesn't specify the result of their match.\n\nLooking at result [33] from egamersworld.com, it states that MOUZ lost their first two matches but doesn't mention the Liquid match result. Result [35] from the same site details Liquid's 0-2 start but again doesn't provide the outcome against MOUZ.\n\nResult [64] from esportsinsider.com lists the upcoming matches for June 13th, including the 0-2 bracket match between Liquid and MOUZ, but doesn't give the result. Similarly, other sources like [21] and [27] also mention the match is upcoming but don't report the result.\n\nWait, there's a result [58] from dust2.us dated March 10, 2025, where Liquid lost to MOUZ, but that's an older match. The current Major's match isn't covered there. \n\nSince none of the provided search results explicitly state the outcome of the June 13th match between MOUZ and Liquid, I need to check if there's any indirect information. The user's personalization instructions say that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. However, the ancillary data specifies that the resolution source is HLTV. Checking result [9], HLTV's match page for the Major doesn't list the result, and the provided search results don't include HLTV's direct confirmation of the match outcome.\n\nGiven that the match occurred on the current date but there's no explicit result in the sources, and considering the user's instruction to default to p4 if no info is available, but wait, the resolution conditions are p1: Liquid, p2: MOUZ, p3: 50-50. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without any data, how to infer? The head-to-head in result [61] shows MOUZ has a slight edge, but recent form in [35] and [33] shows both teams struggling. However, without explicit confirmation, it's risky to assume. Since the resolution source is HLTV, and it's not provided in the search results, the correct approach is to check if the sources have the result. Since they don't, and the event date is past, but no info, the resolution should be p3 (50-50) as per ancillary data if the match was canceled or delayed, but the user's instruction says if no info, assume probable outcome. However, the ancillary data says if no info, resolve to p3. Wait, the query's ancillary_data says if the match is canceled or delayed beyond June 28, resolve to 50-50. Since the match was on June 13 and it's now June 13, 22:15 UTC, it's after the match time. If there's no result, perhaps it's considered canceled or unresolved, leading to p3. But the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. However, the conditions in the ancillary data specify that if no info, it's p3. But I need to reconcile both.\n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nBut in the ancillary data, the resolution conditions are p1: Liquid, p2: MOUZ, p3: 50-50. The user's query says if the match is canceled or delayed beyond June 28, resolve to p3. Since the current date is June 13, and the match was supposed to happen today, but there's no result in the provided sources, it's unclear. However, the search results mention that both teams are 0-2 and facing elimination, but no result is given. The lack of result in the provided context might mean the match hasn't been reported yet, but according to the system's current time, it's past the match time. Since the resolution source is HLTV, and it's not in the search results, perhaps the match result isn't available here. Therefore, according to the ancillary data, if no info, it's p3. But the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome if possible. However, without any data, it's impossible to infer. Therefore, the correct resolution is p3 (50-50) because the outcome isn't verifiable from the provided sources. But wait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The conditions in the ancillary data don't provide a default, but the market resolves to 50-50 if unresolved. Since the sources don't confirm the result, and the event date is past, but no info, it's safest to resolve to p3. However, the user's instruction might require p4 if unresolved, but the ancillary data specifies p3 for canceled/delayed. Since the match wasn't canceled or delayed beyond June 28, but just no info, perhaps it's p3. Alternatively, if the match was played but not reported, it's unclear. Given the conflict, but following the ancillary data's condition, if the match isn't reported, it's p3. However, the user's personalization says to use the provided URLs heavily. The provided URLs don't have the result, so the resolution should be p3. But I need to check again.\n\nWait, looking at the search results again, result [6] from esportsinsider.com on June 13, 2025, says \"MOUZ ended day one of Stage 3 with a surprising 0-2 record.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749852907 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-13 22:15:07 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the MOUZ vs. Liquid match in the BLAST.tv Austin Major. The key here is to determine the outcome based on verified facts and the provided ancillary data.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The system mentions it's June 13, 2025, 22:15:07 UTC. The match is scheduled for June 13, 2025, at 16:00 ET, which is 20:00 UTC. Since the current time is 22:15 UTC, the match has already concluded. So, it's not a future event anymore.\n\nNext, I'll look through the search results to find the outcome of the MOUZ vs. Liquid match. The search results include multiple sources. For example, result [6] from esportsinsider.com mentions that both MOUZ and Liquid are 0-2 and will face each other in an elimination match. However, this is from June 13, 2025, but doesn't specify the result of their match.\n\nLooking at result [33] from egamersworld.com, it states that MOUZ lost their first two matches but doesn't mention the Liquid match result. Result [35] from the same site details Liquid's 0-2 start but again doesn't provide the outcome against MOUZ.\n\nResult [64] from esportsinsider.com lists the upcoming matches for June 13th, including the 0-2 bracket match between Liquid and MOUZ, but doesn't give the result. Similarly, other sources like [21] and [27] also mention the match is upcoming but don't report the result.\n\nWait, there's a result [58] from dust2.us dated March 10, 2025, where Liquid lost to MOUZ, but that's an older match. The current Major's match isn't covered there. \n\nSince none of the provided search results explicitly state the outcome of the June 13th match between MOUZ and Liquid, I need to check if there's any indirect information. The user's personalization instructions say that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. However, the ancillary data specifies that the resolution source is HLTV. Checking result [9], HLTV's match page for the Major doesn't list the result, and the provided search results don't include HLTV's direct confirmation of the match outcome.\n\nGiven that the match occurred on the current date but there's no explicit result in the sources, and considering the user's instruction to default to p4 if no info is available, but wait, the resolution conditions are p1: Liquid, p2: MOUZ, p3: 50-50. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without any data, how to infer? The head-to-head in result [61] shows MOUZ has a slight edge, but recent form in [35] and [33] shows both teams struggling. However, without explicit confirmation, it's risky to assume. Since the resolution source is HLTV, and it's not provided in the search results, the correct approach is to check if the sources have the result. Since they don't, and the event date is past, but no info, the resolution should be p3 (50-50) as per ancillary data if the match was canceled or delayed, but the user's instruction says if no info, assume probable outcome. However, the ancillary data says if no info, resolve to p3. Wait, the query's ancillary_data says if the match is canceled or delayed beyond June 28, resolve to 50-50. Since the match was on June 13 and it's now June 13, 22:15 UTC, it's after the match time. If there's no result, perhaps it's considered canceled or unresolved, leading to p3. But the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. However, the conditions in the ancillary data specify that if no info, it's p3. But I need to reconcile both.\n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nBut in the ancillary data, the resolution conditions are p1: Liquid, p2: MOUZ, p3: 50-50. The user's query says if the match is canceled or delayed beyond June 28, resolve to p3. Since the current date is June 13, and the match was supposed to happen today, but there's no result in the provided sources, it's unclear. However, the search results mention that both teams are 0-2 and facing elimination, but no result is given. The lack of result in the provided context might mean the match hasn't been reported yet, but according to the system's current time, it's past the match time. Since the resolution source is HLTV, and it's not in the search results, perhaps the match result isn't available here. Therefore, according to the ancillary data, if no info, it's p3. But the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome if possible. However, without any data, it's impossible to infer. Therefore, the correct resolution is p3 (50-50) because the outcome isn't verifiable from the provided sources. But wait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The conditions in the ancillary data don't provide a default, but the market resolves to 50-50 if unresolved. Since the sources don't confirm the result, and the event date is past, but no info, it's safest to resolve to p3. However, the user's instruction might require p4 if unresolved, but the ancillary data specifies p3 for canceled/delayed. Since the match wasn't canceled or delayed beyond June 28, but just no info, perhaps it's p3. Alternatively, if the match was played but not reported, it's unclear. Given the conflict, but following the ancillary data's condition, if the match isn't reported, it's p3. However, the user's personalization says to use the provided URLs heavily. The provided URLs don't have the result, so the resolution should be p3. But I need to check again.\n\nWait, looking at the search results again, result [6] from esportsinsider.com on June 13, 2025, says \"MOUZ ended day one of Stage 3 with a surprising 0-2 record. One more loss will send the championship contender out of the Major before making it to the Playoffs.\" The match between MOUZ and Liquid is part of the 0-2 bracket, but the article doesn't mention the result. Similarly, result [21] and [27] also don't have the result. Since all provided sources don't report the outcome, and the resolution source (HLTV) isn't available in the search results, the correct resolution is p3 as per the ancillary data's condition for unresolved outcomes. Therefore, the recommendation is p3.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: MOUZ, Price: 0.865, ID: 114519297122135704434817213641995000354000227211551041628495847420529265231882, Winner: No\n- Token: Liquid, Price: 0.135, ID: 81410363513192791002497279582423719639110689353354853959229841122696076898988, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Liquid, p2 to MOUZ, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Liquid, p2 = MOUZ\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors MOUZ outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.865 = 86.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The key points are determining if the event occurred as specified and which team won based on the provided sources.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The given timestamp is June 13, 2025, 22:15:07 UTC. The match was scheduled for June 13, 2025, at 4:00 PM ET, which is 20:00 UTC. Since the current time is 22:15 UTC, the match should have already taken place. However, the user's personalization instructs that if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, we return p4. But here, the event date is in the past, so we need to check the outcome.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention that both MOUZ and Liquid are 0-2 in Stage 3 and are facing each other in an elimination match. For example, source [12] states that Liquid lost to Lynn Vision and The MongolZ, and their next match is against MOUZ. Similarly, source [23] and [27] confirm that MOUZ and Liquid are both 0-2 and will play each other in the 0-2 bracket. \n\nHowever, none of the provided search results explicitly state the outcome of the MOUZ vs. Liquid match. The latest information available in the sources is from June 13, 2025, but the match time is 16:00 CDT (which is 21:00 UTC). The current timestamp is 22:15 UTC, so the match would have just concluded. However, the search results don't include post-match data. \n\nGiven the absence of explicit results, the next step is to check if there's any information that might indicate the outcome. Sources like [58] mention historical head-to-head stats, but the most recent match listed there is from May 2025, which MOUZ won. However, in the current tournament context, both teams are underperforming. \n\nThe user's personalization also mentions that if no verifiable outcome is available, we should assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The market sentiment strongly favors MOUZ, as seen in sources [15] and [45], where MOUZ is the favorite with odds around 1.29.

The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the MOUZ vs. Liquid match in the BLAST.tv Austin Major. The key points are determining if the event occurred as specified and which team won based on the provided sources.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The given timestamp is June 13, 2025, 22:15:07 UTC. The match was scheduled for June 13, 2025, at 4:00 PM ET, which is 20:00 UTC. Since the current time is 22:15 UTC, the match should have already taken place. However, the user's personalization instructs that if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, we return p4. But here, the event date is in the past, so we need to check the outcome.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention that both MOUZ and Liquid are 0-2 in Stage 3 and are facing each other in an elimination match. For example, source [12] states that Liquid lost to Lynn Vision and The MongolZ, and their next match is against MOUZ. Similarly, source [23] and [27] confirm that MOUZ and Liquid are both 0-2 and will play each other in the 0-2 bracket. \n\nHowever, none of the provided search results explicitly state the outcome of the MOUZ vs. Liquid match. The latest information available in the sources is from June 13, 2025, but the match time is 16:00 CDT (which is 21:00 UTC). The current timestamp is 22:15 UTC, so the match would have just concluded. However, the search results don't include post-match data. \n\nGiven the absence of explicit results, the next step is to check if there's any information that might indicate the outcome. Sources like [58] mention historical head-to-head stats, but the most recent match listed there is from May 2025, which MOUZ won. However, in the current tournament context, both teams are underperforming. \n\nThe user's personalization also mentions that if no verifiable outcome is available, we should assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The market sentiment strongly favors MOUZ, as seen in sources [15] and [45], where MOUZ is the favorite with odds around 1.29. Additionally, MOUZ is ranked higher (#2 vs. #10 for Liquid) and has a better recent win rate. \n\nHowever, the instructions also say to verify if the event occurred. Since the match time has passed, but the search results don't confirm the result, it's possible the data isn't updated yet. In such cases, the resolution should default to p4 if the outcome isn't verifiable. But the user's personalization states that if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nConsidering MOUZ's higher ranking and historical performance, the probable outcome is a MOUZ win. Therefore, the recommendation would be p2. However, I need to ensure there's no overlooked info. Checking all sources again, none report the match result, so strictly following the rules, if the outcome isn't verified, but the event date is past, and no info on postponement, we assume the probable outcome. Hence, p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: MOUZ, Price: 0.865, ID: 114519297122135704434817213641995000354000227211551041628495847420529265231882, Winner: No\n- Token: Liquid, Price: 0.135, ID: 81410363513192791002497279582423719639110689353354853959229841122696076898988, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Liquid, p2 to MOUZ, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Liquid, p2 = MOUZ\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors MOUZ outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.865 = 86.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
