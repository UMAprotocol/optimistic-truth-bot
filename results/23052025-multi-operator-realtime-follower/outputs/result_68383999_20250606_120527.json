      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the next Dutch parliamentary election date will be announced between June 3 and July 3, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if the date is set within that timeframe, regardless of when the election actually happens. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The system says it's June 6, 2025, UTC. The deadline for the announcement is July 3, 2025, ET, which is July 4 UTC. So there's still time until early July for an announcement.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the election date. Result [1] states the election is expected on October 29, 2025. Result [9] is a government news release from June 4, 2025, saying the caretaker government is deciding on the date soon, with the Electoral Council advising against holding it before October 29. Result [12] from the Electoral Council on June 4 also recommends October 29 as the earliest feasible date. Result [15] and [16] confirm the October 29 date was recommended and then officially set by the minister on June 6.\n\nThe key point here is when the date was announced. The user's query is about the announcement date, not the election date. The announcement happened on June 6, 2025, as per result [17], where the minister announced the date after the cabinet meeting. Since June 6 falls within the June 3 to July 3 window, the answer should be \"Yes\". \n\nWait, but the user's deadline is July 3, 11:59 PM ET, which is July 4, 2025, 3:59 AM UTC. The announcement on June 6 is well within that period. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2). All sources confirm the date was set within the specified timeframe.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.

The user wants to know if the next Dutch parliamentary election date will be announced between June 3 and July 3, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if the date is set within that timeframe, regardless of when the election actually happens. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The system says it's June 6, 2025, UTC. The deadline for the announcement is July 3, 2025, ET, which is July 4 UTC. So there's still time until early July for an announcement.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the election date. Result [1] states the election is expected on October 29, 2025. Result [9] is a government news release from June 4, 2025, saying the caretaker government is deciding on the date soon, with the Electoral Council advising against holding it before October 29. Result [12] from the Electoral Council on June 4 also recommends October 29 as the earliest feasible date. Result [15] and [16] confirm the October 29 date was recommended and then officially set by the minister on June 6.\n\nThe key point here is when the date was announced. The user's query is about the announcement date, not the election date. The announcement happened on June 6, 2025, as per result [17], where the minister announced the date after the cabinet meeting. Since June 6 falls within the June 3 to July 3 window, the answer should be \"Yes\". \n\nWait, but the user's deadline is July 3, 11:59 PM ET, which is July 4, 2025, 3:59 AM UTC. The announcement on June 6 is well within that period. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2). All sources confirm the date was set within the specified timeframe.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.999, ID: 106899735064970793568484392725446190609514418618253533469583193749424527088690, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.001, ID: 3605021580956913503223176578147027090753827625297346728125520818597952369384, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.999 = 99.9% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
