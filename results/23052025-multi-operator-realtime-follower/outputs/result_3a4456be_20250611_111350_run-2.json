Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Ethereum Up or Down - June 11, 6 AM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for ETHUSDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the ETHUSDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ETH_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance ETHUSDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 550885\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749640074 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-11 11:07:54 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Configure logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nconsole_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\nconsole_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nconsole_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\nlogger.addHandler(console_handler)\n\ndef get_eth_price_change(date_str, hour, minute, timezone_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches the percentage change for the ETHUSDT pair on Binance for a specific 1-hour candle.\n\n    Args:\n        date_str: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format\n        hour: Hour in 24-hour format\n        minute: Minute\n        timezone_str: Timezone string\n\n    Returns:\n        Percentage change as float or None if data cannot be retrieved.\n    \"\"\"\n    logger.info(f\"Fetching ETHUSDT price change for {date_str} at {hour}:{minute} {timezone_str}\")\n    \n    # Convert the target time to UTC timestamp\n    try:\n        tz = pytz.timezone(timezone_str)\n        time_str = f\"{hour:02d}:{minute:02d}:00\"\n        target_time_local = tz.localize(\n            datetime.strptime(f\"{date_str} {time_str}\", \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n        )\n        target_time_utc = target_time_local.astimezone(timezone.utc)\n        start_time_ms = int(target_time_utc.timestamp() * 1000)\n        \n        logger.debug(f\"Converted local time to UTC timestamp: {start_time_ms}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Error converting time: {e}\")\n        return None\n\n    # Binance API endpoint\n    api_url = \"https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines\"\n    params = {\n        \"symbol\": \"ETHUSDT\",\n        \"interval\": \"1h\",\n        \"limit\": 1,\n        \"startTime\": start_time_ms,\n        \"endTime\": start_time_ms + 3600000  # plus 1 hour\n    }\n\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(api_url, params=params, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n        \n        if data:\n            open_price = float(data[0][1])\n            close_price = float(data[0][4])\n            price_change_percent = ((close_price - open_price) / open_price) * 100\n            logger.info(f\"Successfully retrieved price change: {price_change_percent}%\")\n            return price_change_percent\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        logger.error(f\"API request failed: {e}\")\n    \n    return None\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to determine if the ETH price went up or down.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Specific date and time for the query\n    date_str = \"2025-06-11\"\n    hour = 6  # 6 AM ET\n    minute = 0\n    timezone_str = \"US/Eastern\"\n\n    price_change = get_eth_price_change(date_str, hour, minute, timezone_str)\n    \n    if price_change is None:\n        print(\"recommendation: p4\")  # Unable to resolve\n    elif price_change >= 0:\n        print(\"recommendation: p2\")  # Up\n    else:\n        print(\"recommendation: p1\")  # Down\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p4\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful. Recommendation found: p4.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p4\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.96, ID: 92075475910543549982021718715891204973356036296078995197345378146218556710993, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.04, ID: 20901807458816018201803544590969522792950052203685227396263137181253858305137, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.960 = 96.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

I need you to generate code to solve the following prediction market question:\n\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Ethereum Up or Down - June 11, 6 AM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for ETHUSDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the ETHUSDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ETH_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance ETHUSDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 550885\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Ethereum Up or Down - June 11, 6 AM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for ETHUSDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the ETHUSDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ETH_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance ETHUSDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 550885\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749640074 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-11 11:07:54 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Configure logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nconsole_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\nconsole_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nconsole_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\nlogger.addHandler(console_handler)\n\ndef get_eth_price_change(date_str, hour, minute, timezone_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches the percentage change for the ETHUSDT pair on Binance for a specific 1-hour candle.\n\n    Args:\n        date_str: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format\n        hour: Hour in 24-hour format\n        minute: Minute\n        timezone_str: Timezone string\n\n    Returns:\n        Percentage change as float or None if data cannot be fetched.\n    \"\"\"\n    logger.info(f\"Fetching ETHUSDT price change for {date_str} at {hour}:{minute} {timezone_str}\")\n    \n    # Convert the target time to UTC timestamp\n    try:\n        tz = pytz.timezone(timezone_str)\n        time_str = f\"{hour:02d}:{minute:02d}:00\"\n        target_time_local = tz.localize(\n            datetime.strptime(f\"{date_str} {time_str}\", \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n        )\n        target_time_utc = target_time_local.astimezone(timezone.utc)\n        start_time_ms = int(target_time_utc.timestamp() * 1000)\n        \n        logger.debug(f\"Converted local time to UTC timestamp: {start_time_ms}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Error converting time: {e}\")\n        return None\n\n    # Binance API endpoint\n    api_url = \"https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines\"\n    params = {\n        \"symbol\": \"ETHUSDT\",\n        \"interval\": \"1h\",\n        \"limit\": 1,\n        \"startTime\": start_time_ms,\n        \"endTime\": start_time_ms + 3600000  # plus 1 hour\n    }\n\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(api_url, params=params, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n        \n        if data:\n            open_price = float(data[0][1])\n            close_price = float(data[0][4])\n            price_change_percent = ((close_price - open_price) / open_price) * 100\n            logger.info(f\"Successfully retrieved price change: {price_change_percent}%\")\n            return price_change_percent\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        logger.error(f\"API request failed: {e}\")\n    \n    return None\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to determine if the ETH price went up or down.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Specific date and time for the query\n    date_str = \"2025-06-11\"\n    hour = 6  # 6 AM\n    minute = 0\n    timezone_str = \"US/Eastern\"\n\n    price_change = get_eth_price_change(date_str, hour, minute, timezone_str)\n    \n    if price_change is None:\n        print(\"recommendation: p4\")  # Unable to resolve\n    elif price_change >= 0:\n        print(\"recommendation: p2\")  # Up\n    else:\n        print(\"recommendation: p1\")  # Down\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p4\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.960 = 96.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market prediction about whether Ethereum's price (ETHUSDT) on Binance will be up or down at a specific time. The key is to check the 1-hour candle starting June 11 at 6 AM ET. The resolution depends on the percentage change shown on Binance for that candle.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the current time. The given timestamp is June 11, 2025, 11:07:54 UTC. The event time is June 11, 6 AM ET, which is 10 AM UTC. Since the current time is 11:07 UTC, the candle in question (10-11 AM UTC) has already closed. \n\nNext, I should look at the provided search results for ETHUSDT data around that time. Search result [11] from CoinGecko shows the ETH/USDT rate on June 11 as 2,768.86 USDT with a -1.58% change. However, this might be the 24-hour change, not the specific 1-hour candle. \n\nResult [3] mentions Fidelity's Ethereum ETF inflow on June 11, with ETH price at $3,550 at 10 AM UTC. But this seems inconsistent with other data. Result [4] states ETH hit a 15-week high of $2,833 on June 11, but the time isn't specified. Result [15] from CoinDesk on June 10 mentions ETH reaching $2,783, but that's the previous day. \n\nLooking at result [11] again, the ETH/USDT rate history table shows June 11's closing price at 2,768.86, which is a decrease from June 10's 2,813.39. However, the 1-hour candle at 10 AM UTC might have a different percentage. \n\nSince the exact percentage change for that specific hour isn't directly provided, I need to infer. If the overall daily change is negative, but the specific hour might have been positive. However, without explicit data for that hour, it's challenging. The user instructions say if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nGiven the ancillary data, if the change is >=0, it's Up (p2). If not, Down (p1). Without clear data, but considering the daily trend on June 11 is negative, it's probable the 1-hour candle also had a negative change. Therefore, the recommendation would be p1 (Down). But wait, result [3] mentions a price increase to $3,550 at 10 AM UTC. That's a significant jump. However, other sources like [11] show lower prices. There's a discrepancy here. \n\nNeed to resolve this conflict. The user specified using Binance as the source. Check result [6], the Binance market data. The ETH/USDT price on Binance is listed as $2,766.87 in the table. The timestamp is \"Recently,\" but the date isn't clear. Result [4] from TradingView on June 11 mentions ETH at $2,788, down 0.8% on the day. If the 1-hour candle at 10 AM UTC was part of a downward trend, the change might be negative. \n\nAlternatively, result [3] from Blockchain.news states that on June 11 at 10 AM UTC, ETH was $3,550. This seems like an outlier compared to other sources. It's possible there was a typo or misunderstanding in that article. Given multiple sources indicating prices around $2,700-$2,800 on June 11, the $3,550 figure might be incorrect. \n\nTherefore, relying on the more consistent data points, the price on June 11 was around $2,768, indicating a decrease from the previous day. Assuming the 1-hour candle at 10 AM UTC had a negative change, the resolution would be Down (p1). However, without explicit confirmation of that specific hour's change, there's uncertainty. But per the user's instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. Given the overall negative daily trend, p1 is likely correct.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.960 = 96.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the Ethereum price (ETHUSDT) on Binance was up or down for the 1-hour candle starting at June 11, 6 AM ET. The resolution depends on the percentage change shown on Binance's 1H candle for that specific time.\n\nFirst, I need to convert 6 AM ET to UTC. ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, so 6 AM ET would be 10 AM UTC. The candle in question is from 10:00 to 11:00 UTC on June 11, 2025.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the price around that time. For example, result [2] states that as of 10:00 AM UTC on June 11, Ethereum's price was approximately $3,550 on Binance. Result [12] also mentions the price at 10:00 AM UTC as $3,550. However, other sources like [1] mention a high of $2,833 on June 11, which seems conflicting. Wait, maybe there's a discrepancy here. Let me check the dates again. Result [1] is from June 11, 2025, but mentions a high of $2,833, while result [2] and [12] from the same date mention $3,550. That's a big difference. Hmm, maybe some sources have different data or typos. Need to cross-verify.\n\nLooking at result [20], the ETH to USDT rate on June 11, 2025, is listed as $2,768.86, which aligns more with the lower price. However, result [39] and [12] mention $3,550. This inconsistency is confusing. Let me check the timestamps. The user's query is about the 1-hour candle starting at 6 AM ET (10 AM UTC). The search results might have data from different times. For example, result [2] says \"As of 10:00 AM UTC on June 11, 2025, Ethereum's price stood at approximately 3,550 USD on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase.\" But result [20] shows the closing price on June 11 as $2,768.86. Wait, maybe the $3,550 is a typo or from a different context. Let me check other sources.\n\nResult [16] mentions on June 11, 2025, at 10:00 AM UTC, ETH broke through $4,000, reaching $4,125.32. That's even higher. But this seems inconsistent with other data points. There's a lot of conflicting information here. How to resolve this?\n\nWait, the user specified that the resolution source is Binance's ETHUSDT pair. So I should prioritize data directly from Binance or sources citing Binance. Result [5] provides a table from CoinGecko showing Binance's ETH/USDT price at $2,766.87. Result [61] also lists Binance's ETH/USDT at $2,766.87. These are consistent. However, result [2] and [12] mention $3,550, which might be a mistake or from a different pair. Maybe those sources confused ETH with another asset or had a typo. Since the user's resolution depends on Binance's data, the correct price is likely around $2,766 as per [5] and [61].\n\nNow, the 1-hour candle from 10:00 to 11:00 UTC. The percentage change is calculated as (Closing Price - Opening Price)/Opening Price * 100. If the closing price is higher than the opening, it's up (p2); else, down (p1).\n\nLooking for the specific candle data. Result [11] mentions that on June 10, 20:00 UTC, ETH/USDT on Binance had a bullish candlestick breaking above the 50-day MA at $2,820, closing at $2,865. But that's a different time. Result [35] from June 11, 2025, at 11:00 AM UTC, discusses a 1-hour chart with resistance at $3,525. However, this might be after the candle in question.\n\nResult [12] states that as of 4:00 PM UTC on June 11, the RSI was 62, and the 50-day MA was $3,400. But again, this is later than the 10:00 AM candle. The key is to find the opening and closing prices for the 10:00-11:00 UTC candle.\n\nResult [20] shows the ETH/USDT rate on June 11 as $2,768.86, but that's the daily close. The hourly data isn't directly provided. However, result [25] from CoinMarketCap on June 11, 2025, at 10:32 AM UTC, lists the ETH to USDT rate as 2,768.99. If this is the closing price at 11:00 UTC, then the change would depend on the opening price at 10:00 UTC.\n\nAssuming the opening price at 10:00 UTC was around $2,768 (from [25]), and if the price stayed flat, the change would be 0%. But if the price increased during the hour, it would be positive. However, without explicit data on the exact 1-hour candle's open and close, it's challenging. The user mentioned that the resolution source is Binance's displayed change for that specific 1H candle. Since the search results don't provide the exact percentage change for that candle, but some sources indicate a price around $2,768-2,795 during that day, and considering the overall market sentiment from ETF inflows (result [2], [39]) and positive technical indicators (result [12], [16]), it's possible the candle closed with a positive change. However, without explicit data, I might have to default to the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The user instruction says if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. Given the positive inflow news and the price increase mentioned in some sources, it's likely the change was positive. Therefore, the resolution would be p2 (Up).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Therefore, the resolution would be p2 (Up).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.96, ID: 92075475910543549982021718715891204973356036296078995197345378146218556710993, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.04, ID: 20901807458816018201803544590969522792950052203685227396263137181253858305137, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.960 = 96.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

Your task is to analyze the provided query and decide which AI solver is best suited to handle it.\n\nAvailable solvers: perplexity\n\nSolver descriptions:\n- perplexity: Uses the Perplexity AI search engine to find information online to answer general questions. Best for:\n  * Historical data and events\n  * General knowledge questions requiring context\n  * Questions needing interpretation of complex information\n  * Has knowledge cutoff and may not have very recent information\n\n- code_runner: Executes code to fetch real-time data from specific APIs. Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Currently available data sources based on API keys:\n    - MLB (Major League Baseball) data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Ethereum Up or Down - June 11, 6 AM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for ETHUSDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the ETHUSDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ETH_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance ETHUSDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 550885\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.

If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749640074 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-11 11:07:54 UTC",
        "system_prompt_after": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt.
