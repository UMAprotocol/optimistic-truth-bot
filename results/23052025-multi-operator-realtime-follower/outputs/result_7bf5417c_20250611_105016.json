      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to determine the outcome of the Arthur Rinderknech vs. Marton Fucsovics match in the second round of the Boss Open on June 11, 2025. The resolution depends on who advances, with specific conditions for p1 (Fucsovics), p2 (Rinderknech), or p3 (50-50 if canceled/delayed).\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The user provided the current Unix timestamp as 1749638541, which converts to June 11, 2025, 10:42:21 UTC. The match was scheduled for June 11 at 5:00 AM ET, which is 9:00 AM UTC. Since the current time is 10:42 AM UTC, the match should have already taken place. Therefore, the event date is in the past, and we need to verify the outcome.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources (1, 6, 16, 19, 20, 23, 25, 29, 44, 50, 66) report that Arthur Rinderknech defeated Denis Shapovalov in the first round on June 10, advancing to the second round against Marton Fucsovics. Similarly, sources (2, 4, 18, 26, 40, 57) confirm that Marton Fucsovics beat Yannick Hanfmann in the first round, setting up the second-round clash with Rinderknech.\n\nThe next step is to find the result of their second-round match. The search results include several previews and predictions (5, 14, 21, 28, 33, 41, 53, 59, 67) indicating the match was scheduled for June 11 at 9:00 AM UTC (5:00 AM ET). However, none of the provided search results explicitly state the outcome of the Rinderknech vs. Fucsovics match. Some sources (9, 13, 47, 56) mention the match is upcoming or provide live score pages, but without results. \n\nSince the current timestamp is after the match's scheduled time, but no results are present in the provided context, I need to check if there's any indication of postponement or cancellation. The user's personalization instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, we should assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p1 as Fucsovics winning, p2 as Rinderknech, and p3 as 50-50 if unresolved.\n\nGiven the lack of explicit results in the search context, but considering the match was scheduled and the event date has passed, the next step is to infer based on available data. However, the user's instructions specify that if no verifiable information is available, and the event date is past, we should assume the most probable outcome. The previews (5, 14, 21, 28, 33, 41, 53, 59, 67) mostly favor Fucsovics as the predicted winner, with odds around 1.615 vs. Rinderknech's 2.31. However, predictions are not results.\n\nSince the official source (bossopen.com) isn't provided in the search results, and the available data doesn't confirm the result, but the event date is past, the resolution would default to p4 (unresolved) per the user's personalization. However, the user's resolution_conditions don't include p4, only p1, p2, p3. Wait, the personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, resolve based on most probable outcome. But the ancillary data says if no info, p3 (50-50). However, the user's personalization says if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The conflict here needs resolving.\n\nThe user's personalization takes precedence: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" So, even if no info, we have to pick the most probable. The ancillary data's p3 is for canceled/delayed, which isn't the case here. Since the match was held (as per schedule), but no result is found, but the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome. The previews suggest Fucsovics is favored, but without official confirmation, it's risky. However, the user's instruction says to use the primary source (bossopen.com) or credible reporting. Since none of the provided search results have the result, but the event date is past, perhaps the match was played, and the result isn't in the provided context. In real-time, we'd check official sources, but given the provided data, we have to go with the most probable. However, the user's personalization also says if the event is scheduled for the same day but later time (current time is 10:42 AM UTC, match was at 9:00 AM UTC), it's considered past. Since the match was at 9:00 AM UTC and it's now 10:42 AM, it's past. But without results in the provided sources, we have to default to p3 (50-50) as per the resolution_conditions if no info. However, the user's personalization says if no info but event date past, assume most probable. The conflict here is between the two instructions. The resolution_conditions say if no info, p3, but the personalization says assume most probable. The personalization should take precedence. However, the ancillary data's resolution_conditions have p3 for unknown. Since the user's personalization says to follow the ancillary data's resolution conditions, but also to assume most probable if no info. Since the match was held, but no result is found in the provided sources, and the user's instructions say to use the primary source (bossopen.com) which isn't in the search results, but the provided search results don't have the outcome, it's a dilemma. However, the user's personalization says if no verifiable info, answer as well as possible with existing knowledge. Given that, and the fact that the search results don't include the match result, but the event date is past, the correct resolution would be p3 (50-50) as per the resolution_conditions. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is past and no info, assume most probable outcome. But without any data points in the provided context indicating the result, it's impossible to determine. Therefore, the safe answer is p3. However, the user's personalization might require p4, but the resolution_conditions don't have p4. Wait, the user's personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. Since the event is in the past, p4 isn't applicable. The resolution_conditions only have p1, p2, p3. Therefore, since the event date is past and no result is found in the provided sources, but the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome, which in the previews is Fucsovics, but without official confirmation, it's uncertain. However, the strictest interpretation is that without verifiable info, it's p3. But the user's instruction says to assume the most probable. Given the conflict, I think the correct answer is p3 (50-50) because the provided search results don't include the match result, and we can't confirm it. However, some sources (like 9, 13, 47, 56) list the match as upcoming or live, but no result. Therefore, the resolution is p3.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749638541 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-11 10:42:21 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to determine the outcome of the Arthur Rinderknech vs. Marton Fucsovics match in the second round of the Boss Open on June 11, 2025. The resolution depends on who advances, with specific conditions for p1 (Fucsovics), p2 (Rinderknech), or p3 (50-50 if canceled/delayed).\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The user provided the current Unix timestamp as 1749638541, which converts to June 11, 2025, 10:42:21 UTC. The match was scheduled for June 11 at 5:00 AM ET, which is 9:00 AM UTC. Since the current time is 10:42 AM UTC, the match should have already taken place. Therefore, the event date is in the past, and we need to verify the outcome.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources (1, 6, 16, 19, 20, 23, 25, 29, 44, 50, 66) report that Arthur Rinderknech defeated Denis Shapovalov in the first round on June 10, advancing to the second round against Marton Fucsovics. Similarly, sources (2, 4, 18, 26, 40, 57) confirm that Marton Fucsovics beat Yannick Hanfmann in the first round, setting up the second-round clash with Rinderknech.\n\nThe next step is to find the result of their second-round match. The search results include several previews and predictions (5, 14, 21, 28, 33, 41, 53, 59, 67) indicating the match was scheduled for June 11 at 9:00 AM UTC (5:00 AM ET). However, none of the provided search results explicitly state the outcome of the Rinderknech vs. Fucsovics match. Some sources (9, 13, 47, 56) mention the match is upcoming or provide live score pages, but without results. \n\nSince the current timestamp is after the match's scheduled time, but no results are present in the provided context, I need to check if there's any indication of postponement or cancellation. The user's personalization instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, we should assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p1 as Fucsovics winning, p2 as Rinderknech, and p3 as 50-50 if unresolved.\n\nGiven the lack of explicit results in the search context, but considering the match was scheduled and the event date has passed, the next step is to infer based on available data. However, the user's instructions specify that if no verifiable information is available, and the event date is past, we should assume the most probable outcome. The previews (5, 14, 21, 28, 33, 41, 53, 59, 67) mostly favor Fucsovics as the predicted winner, with odds around 1.615 vs. Rinderknech's 2.31. However, predictions are not results.\n\nSince the official source (bossopen.com) isn't provided in the search results, and the available data doesn't confirm the result, but the event date is past, the resolution would default to p4 (unresolved) per the user's personalization. However, the user's resolution_conditions don't include p4, only p1, p2, p3. Wait, the personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, resolve based on most probable outcome. But the ancillary data says if no info, p3 (50-50). However, the user's personalization says if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The conflict here needs resolving.\n\nThe user's personalization takes precedence: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" So, even if no info, we have to pick the most probable. The ancillary data's p3 is for canceled/delayed, which isn't the case here. Since the match was held (as per schedule), but no result is found, but the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome. The previews suggest Fucsovics is favored, but without official confirmation, it's risky. However, the user's instruction says to use the primary source (bossopen.com) or credible reporting. Since none of the provided search results have the result, but the event date is past, perhaps the match was played, and the result isn't in the provided context. In real-time, we'd check official sources, but given the provided data, we have to go with the most probable. However, the user's personalization also says if the event is scheduled for the same day but later time (current time is 10:42 AM UTC, match was at 9:00 AM UTC), it's considered past. Since the match was at 9:00 AM UTC and it's now 10:42 AM, it's past. But without results in the provided sources, we have to default to p3 (50-50) as per the resolution_conditions if no info. However, the user's personalization says if no info but event date past, assume most probable. The conflict here is between the two instructions. The resolution_conditions say if no info, p3, but the personalization says assume most probable. The personalization should take precedence. However, the ancillary data's resolution_conditions have p3 for unknown. Since the user's personalization says to follow the ancillary data's resolution conditions, but also to assume most probable if no info. Since the match was held, but no result is found in the provided sources, and the user's instructions say to use the primary source (bossopen.com) which isn't in the search results, but the provided search results don't have the outcome, it's a dilemma. However, the user's personalization says if no verifiable info, answer as well as possible with existing knowledge. Given that, and the fact that the search results don't include the match result, but the event date is past, the correct resolution would be p3 (50-50) as per the resolution_conditions. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is past and no info, assume most probable outcome. But without any data points in the provided context indicating the result, it's impossible to determine. Therefore, the safe answer is p3. However, the user's personalization might require p4, but the resolution_conditions don't have p4. Wait, the user's personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. Since the event is in the past, p4 isn't applicable. The resolution_conditions only have p1, p2, p3.

However, some sources (like 9, 13, 47, 56) list the match as upcoming or live, but no result. Therefore, the resolution is p3.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Rinderknech, Price: 0.0055, ID: 34693570737187592826546710942113293796546016501669321872840931545024400383071, Winner: No\n- Token: Fucsovics, Price: 0.9945, ID: 91777299787795975729336093700516972339846844120409815357230537073000177342358, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Fucsovics, p2 to Rinderknech, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Fucsovics, p2 = Rinderknech\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Fucsovics outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about resolving a UMA optimistic oracle request for the outcome of the tennis match between Arthur Rinderknech and Marton Fucsovics at the Boss Open on June 11, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Rinderknech\" (p2) if he wins, \"Fucsovics\" (p1) if he wins, and 50-50 (p3) if the match is tied, canceled, or delayed beyond July 11, 2025. The current timestamp is June 11, 2025, 10:42:21 UTC, and the match was scheduled for June 11 at 11:00 am local time in Stuttgart, which is UTC+2, so that would be 09:00 UTC. The current time is past the scheduled start, so the event should have occurred.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided to determine the outcome of the match. The user mentioned that a previous response returned p3, but they want a different approach. Let me go through the sources carefully.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources (1, 3, 7, 16, 18, 20, 29, 47, 52) report that Rinderknech defeated Shapovalov in the first round on June 10 and is set to face Fucsovics in the second round on June 11. However, the actual result of the Rinderknech vs. Fucsovics match isn't directly reported in any of the provided sources. The latest information is from June 10 or 11, but the match was scheduled for June 11 at 11:00 am local time (09:00 UTC). Since the current timestamp is June 11, 10:42 UTC, the match should have already taken place, but none of the search results explicitly state the outcome.\n\nSome sources (5, 6, 14, 21, 24, 28, 31, 39, 45, 54, 63) discuss the upcoming match, predictions, and head-to-head stats, favoring Fucsovics. However, predictions aren't outcomes. The user's personalization instructions mention that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, we should assume the most probable outcome based on conditions unless contradicted. However, the user also states that if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, it should resolve to p4. Wait, the current time is June 11, 10:42 UTC, and the match was scheduled for 09:00 UTC on the same day. So the event has already occurred. But the search results don't include any post-match reports. All sources are from June 10 or 11 but before the match time. \n\nSince there's no result reported in the provided context, and the event date is in the past, but no outcome is available, the resolution should default to p3 (50-50) as per the ancillary data if the outcome isn't verifiable. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. But the instructions also say if no verifiable info, resolve to p4. Wait, the personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nBut in this case, the event date is June 11, which is the same as the current date. The match was scheduled for 11:00 am local time (Stuttgart is UTC+2), which would be 09:00 UTC. The current timestamp is 10:42 UTC, so the match should have already happened. However, the provided search results don't include any post-match reports. All sources are from before the match. Therefore, there's no verifiable outcome available in the provided context. \n\nAccording to the user's instructions, if the event is in the past (which it is, as of the current timestamp) and no verifiable outcome is found, we should assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The ancillary data's resolution conditions are p1 for Fucsovics, p2 for Rinderknech, p3 for 50-50. However, the user's personalization also says that if the event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it's still a future event. Wait, in this case, the event was at 09:00 UTC, and the current time is 10:42 UTC, so the event is in the past. Therefore, if no outcome is found, we need to check if it can be inferred. \n\nBut the search results don't have any information post-match. All sources are from before the match. Therefore, there's no verifiable information. The user's instruction says if no verifiable info, and the event is in the past, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The conditions in the ancillary data don't specify probabilities, but the search results include predictions favoring Fucsovics. However, predictions aren't outcomes. \n\nThe user's personalization also mentions that if the user prompt contains URLs, only use those. The search results provided are the only sources. Since none report the outcome, and the event is in the past, but no info is available, the resolution should be p3 (50-50) as per the ancillary data's condition if the match is canceled or delayed beyond July 11, but that's not the case here. Wait, the ancillary data says if the match is canceled or delayed beyond July 11, resolve to p3. However, the current date is June 11, and the match was supposed to happen on June 11. If the match was delayed but not beyond July 11, it's still pending. However, there's no info about a delay. \n\nGiven the lack of post-match data in the provided sources, and the event date being in the past, but no outcome available, the correct resolution would be p3 (50-50) as per the ancillary data's condition for unresolved outcomes. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But how to determine that? The predictions in the sources suggest Fucsovics was favored, but that's not a result. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" The conditions in the user prompt's ancillary data don't provide probabilities, but the market resolution is based on who advances. Since there's no data, but the event is past, and no sources report the outcome, we have to default to p3. However, the user's previous response was p3, and they want a different approach. Maybe check if any sources mention the match being postponed or canceled. The search results don't indicate that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the match was played, but the result isn't in the provided sources. In that case, since it's past the event time and no result is found, but the user's instructions say to use the provided sources, and if they're unhelpful, answer as best as possible. Since the sources don't have the result, but the event is in the past, perhaps the resolution is p3. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable outcome based on the ancillary data's resolution conditions isn't clear, but the predictions in the sources suggest Fucsovics was more likely. However, the user's instructions say to base the resolution strictly on verified facts, not predictions. \n\nSince there's no verified outcome in the provided sources, and the event date is in the past, the resolution should be p3 (50-50) as per the ancillary data's condition for unresolved matches. However, the user's personalization might require p4 if it's a future event, but the event is in the past. Wait, the current time is after the match's scheduled time, so it's not a future event. Therefore, per the user's instructions, if no verifiable info, and the event is in the past, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But without any data, how to determine that? The ancillary data's resolution conditions don't provide probabilities, but the market resolves to p1 or p2 based on the winner. Since there's no data, perhaps the correct answer is p3. However, the user's previous response was p3, and they want a different approach. Maybe the match was indeed played, and the result is available elsewhere, but not in the provided sources. However, we can only use the provided sources. \n\nGiven all this, the correct resolution is p3 because there's no verifiable outcome in the provided sources, and the event date is in the past. However, the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome if no info. The predictions in the sources suggest Fucsovics was favored, but that's not a fact. Since we can't use predictions, and must rely only on verified outcomes, and none are present, the resolution should be p3. But the user's instructions say if no info, answer as best as possible. Maybe the match was played, and the lack of results in the sources implies it wasn't reported, but that's speculative. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the match was not played, leading to p3. However, there's no info about cancellation. Given the strict instructions to rely only on provided sources and not external knowledge, and the sources not reporting the result, the resolution must be p3. However, the user's previous response was p3, and they want a different approach. Maybe the answer is p4, but p4 is for future events. Since the event is in the past, p4 isn't applicable. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.\"\n\nIn this case, the event was scheduled for June 11 at 09:00 UTC, and the current timestamp is June 11 at 10:42 UTC. So the event is in the past. Therefore, p4 is not applicable. The resolution should be based on whether the outcome is known. Since it's not in the sources, and the event is in the past, per the user's instructions, if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data's conditions don't specify, but the market resolves to p1 or p2. However, without any data, we can't assume. Therefore, the correct resolution is p3 (50-50) as per the ancillary data's condition for unresolved matches. But the user's previous response was p3, and they want a different approach. Maybe I missed a source. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the sources again, some sources (like 25, 37, 41, 51) are from Sofascore and mention the match is live or upcoming, but no result. Source 55 is a match page with no result. Source 64 mentions other results but not Rinderknech vs. Fucsovics. Source 64 lists Moutet's win but not the match in question. Therefore, no result is available in the provided sources. \n\nThus, the resolution should be p3 as the outcome isn't verifiable from the provided sources, and the event date is in the past. However, the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome if no info. But without any data, it's impossible to determine. Therefore, the correct answer is p3. But the user says the previous response was p3 and wants a different approach. Maybe the answer is p4, but p4 is only for future events. Since the event is in the past, p4 isn't applicable. Therefore, the answer remains p3.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749638541 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-11 10:42:21 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p3. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about resolving a UMA optimistic oracle request for the outcome of the tennis match between Arthur Rinderknech and Marton Fucsovics at the Boss Open on June 11, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Rinderknech\" (p2) if he wins, \"Fucsovics\" (p1) if he wins, and 50-50 (p3) if the match is tied, canceled, or delayed beyond July 11, 2025. The current timestamp is June 11, 2025, 10:42:21 UTC, and the match was scheduled for June 11 at 11:00 am local time in Stuttgart, which is UTC+2, so that would be 09:00 UTC. The current time is past the scheduled start, so the event should have occurred.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided to determine the outcome of the match. The user mentioned that a previous response returned p3, but they want a different approach. Let me go through the sources carefully.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources (1, 3, 7, 16, 18, 20, 29, 47, 52) report that Rinderknech defeated Shapovalov in the first round on June 10 and is set to face Fucsovics in the second round on June 11. However, the actual result of the Rinderknech vs. Fucsovics match isn't directly reported in any of the provided sources. The latest information is from June 10 or 11, but the match was scheduled for June 11 at 11:00 am local time (09:00 UTC). Since the current timestamp is June 11, 10:42 UTC, the match should have already taken place, but none of the search results explicitly state the outcome.\n\nSome sources (5, 6, 14, 21, 24, 28, 31, 39, 45, 54, 63) discuss the upcoming match, predictions, and head-to-head stats, favoring Fucsovics. However, predictions aren't outcomes. The user's personalization instructions mention that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, we should assume the most probable outcome based on conditions unless contradicted. However, the user also states that if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, it should resolve to p4. Wait, the current time is June 11, 10:42 UTC, and the match was scheduled for 09:00 UTC on the same day. So the event has already occurred. But the search results don't include any post-match reports. All sources are from June 10 or 11 but before the match time. \n\nSince there's no result reported in the provided context, and the event date is in the past, but no outcome is available, the resolution should default to p3 (50-50) as per the ancillary data if the outcome isn't verifiable. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. But the instructions also say if no verifiable info, resolve to p4. Wait, the personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nBut in this case, the event date is June 11, which is the same as the current date. The match was scheduled for 11:00 am local time (Stuttgart is UTC+2), which would be 09:00 UTC. The current timestamp is 10:42 UTC, so the match should have already happened. However, the provided search results don't include any post-match reports. All sources are from before the match. Therefore, there's no verifiable outcome available in the provided context. \n\nAccording to the user's instructions, if the event is in the past (which it is, as of the current timestamp) and no verifiable outcome is found, we should assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The ancillary data's resolution conditions are p1 for Fucsovics, p2 for Rinderknech, p3 for 50-50. However, the user's personalization also says that if the event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it's still a future event. Wait, in this case, the event was at 09:00 UTC, and the current time is 10:42 UTC, so the event is in the past. Therefore, if no outcome is found, we need to check if it can be inferred. \n\nBut the search results don't have any information post-match. All sources are from before the match. Therefore, there's no verifiable information. The user's instruction says if no verifiable info, and the event is in the past, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The conditions in the ancillary data don't specify probabilities, but the search results include predictions favoring Fucsovics. However, predictions aren't outcomes. \n\nThe user's personalization also mentions that if the user prompt contains URLs, only use those. The search results provided are the only sources. Since none report the outcome, and the event is in the past, but no info is available, the resolution should be p3 (50-50) as per the ancillary data's condition if the match is canceled or delayed beyond July 11, but that's not the case here. Wait, the ancillary data says if the match is canceled or delayed beyond July 11, resolve to p3. However, the current date is June 11, and the match was supposed to happen on June 11. If the match was delayed but not beyond July 11, it's still pending. However, there's no info about a delay. \n\nGiven the lack of post-match data in the provided sources, and the event date being in the past, but no outcome available, the correct resolution would be p3 (50-50) as per the ancillary data's condition for unresolved outcomes. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But how to determine that? The predictions in the sources suggest Fucsovics was favored, but that's not a result. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" The conditions in the user prompt's ancillary data don't provide probabilities, but the market resolution is based on who advances. Since there's no data, but the event is past, and no sources report the outcome, we have to default to p3. However, the user's previous response was p3, and they want a different approach. Maybe check if any sources mention the match being postponed or canceled. The search results don't indicate that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the match was played, but the result isn't in the provided sources. In that case, since it's past the event time and no result is found, but the user's instructions say to use the provided sources, and if they're unhelpful, answer as best as possible. Since the sources don't have the result, but the event is in the past, perhaps the resolution is p3. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable outcome based on the ancillary data's resolution conditions isn't clear, but the predictions in the sources suggest Fucsovics was more likely. However, the user's instructions say to base the resolution strictly on verified facts, not predictions. \n\nSince there's no verified outcome in the provided sources, and the event date is in the past, the resolution should be p3 (50-50) as per the ancillary data's condition for unresolved matches. However, the user's personalization might require p4 if it's a future event, but the event is in the past. Wait, the current time is after the match's scheduled time, so it's not a future event. Therefore, per the user's instructions, if no verifiable info, and the event is in the past, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But without any data, how to determine that? The ancillary data's resolution conditions don't provide probabilities, but the market resolves to p1 or p2 based on the winner. Since there's no data, perhaps the correct answer is p3. However, the user's previous response was p3, and they want a different approach. Maybe the match was indeed played, and the result is available elsewhere, but not in the provided sources. However, we can only use the provided sources. \n\nGiven all this, the correct resolution is p3 because there's no verifiable outcome in the provided sources, and the event date is in the past. However, the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome if no info. The predictions in the sources suggest Fucsovics was favored, but that's not a fact.

Given the strict instructions to rely only on provided sources and not external knowledge, and the sources not reporting the result, the resolution must be p3. However, the user's previous response was p3, and they want a different approach. Maybe the answer is p4, but p4 is for future events. Since the event is in the past, p4 isn't applicable. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.\"\n\nIn this case, the event was scheduled for June 11 at 09:00 UTC, and the current timestamp is June 11 at 10:42 UTC. So the event is in the past. Therefore, p4 is not applicable. The resolution should be based on whether the outcome is known.

Source 55 is a match page with no result. Source 64 mentions other results but not Rinderknech vs. Fucsovics. Source 64 lists Moutet's win but not the match in question. Therefore, no result is available in the provided sources. \n\nThus, the resolution should be p3 as the outcome isn't verifiable from the provided sources, and the event date is in the past. However, the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome if no info. But without any data, it's impossible to determine. Therefore, the correct answer is p3. But the user says the previous response was p3 and wants a different approach. Maybe the answer is p4, but p4 is only for future events. Since the event is in the past, p4 isn't applicable. Therefore, the answer remains p3.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Rinderknech, Price: 0.0055, ID: 34693570737187592826546710942113293796546016501669321872840931545024400383071, Winner: No\n- Token: Fucsovics, Price: 0.9945, ID: 91777299787795975729336093700516972339846844120409815357230537073000177342358, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Fucsovics, p2 to Rinderknech, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Fucsovics, p2 = Rinderknech\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Fucsovics outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

The event date is June 11, 2025, which is in the past relative to the current timestamp of June 11, 2025, 10:42:21 UTC. So, the first thing I need to check is whether the match occurred and what the result was.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are multiple sources indicating that the match took place. For example, result [5] mentions that Arthur Rinderknech defeated Denis Shapovalov in the first round and was set to play Fucsovics in the second round. Result [13] states that Fucsovics won his first-round match against Yannick Hanfmann, setting up the second-round clash with Rinderknech. \n\nNow, the key is to find the actual result of their second-round match. Several sources, like [6], [7], [15], [22], [31], [54], and [71], provide predictions and previews for the match, but they don't report the outcome. However, result [12] lists live scores from Stuttgart, including \"Marton FucsovicsFucsovics \u2013 Yannick HanfmannHanfmann (7-5 6-4)\" and \"Arthur RinderknechRinderknech \u2013 Denis ShapovalovShapovalov (6-4 2-6 6-0)\", but doesn't show the result of their head-to-head. \n\nWait, result [65] from Sofascore shows the live score page for the match, but it doesn't have the final result. Similarly, result [41] from ESPN's live scores doesn't list the result either. However, result [37] from Tennis Connected mentions that Rinderknech defeated Shapovalov and was to face Fucsovics next, but again, no result. \n\nLooking deeper, result [45] is a PDF from ATP Tour media notes, which includes detailed player stats and match schedules but doesn't provide the result of the specific match. Result [46] from bossopen.com lists the full program for Tuesday, including the Rinderknech vs. Fucsovics match, but since it's dated June 9, 2025, it's a preview, not the result.\n\nWait, the user's current timestamp is June 11, 2025, 10:42:21 UTC, and the match was scheduled for June 11 at 11:00 am on Center Court. The current time is 10:42, so the match hasn't happened yet. But wait, the Unix timestamp given is 1749638541, which converts to June 11, 2025, 10:42:21 UTC. The match is scheduled for 11:00 am UTC on the same day. Therefore, the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp. According to the personalization instructions, if the event is scheduled for a future date or time, the recommendation should be p4. However, the user mentioned that the previous response returned p3 and asked to re-evaluate with a focus on market sentiment favoring Fucsovics.\n\nBut wait, the current timestamp is June 11, 10:42 AM UTC, and the match is at 11:00 AM UTC. Since the event is in the future (18 minutes later), the correct resolution should be p4 (cannot be resolved yet). However, the user's additional instructions say to consider the market conditions and strong sentiment favoring Fucsovics. But according to the rules, if the event is in the future, regardless of predictions, it should be p4. However, the user might have conflicting information. Let me double-check the event date.\n\nWait, the query states the market resolves to 50-50 if delayed beyond July 11, 2025, but the event date is June 11. The current timestamp is June 11, so the match is today. If the current time is before the match, then it's a future event. However, some sources might have reported the result already if the match occurred. But according to the search results provided, there's no indication that the match has concluded. All sources mentioning the match are previews, predictions, or live scores without a final result. Therefore, the event is still in the future, and the recommendation should be p4. However, the user's previous response was p3, and they want a re-evaluation. Maybe there's a time zone confusion. The match is at 11:00 am UTC, and the current time is 10:42 am UTC, so it's 18 minutes before the match. Therefore, the event hasn't occurred yet, so p4 is correct. But the user's personalization says to consider market sentiment. However, the strict rule is that if the event is in the future, it's p4. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Where p1 corresponds to Fucsovics, p2 to Rinderknech, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Fucsovics, p2 = Rinderknech\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Fucsovics outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

DO NOT use command-line arguments. Extract all necessary information from the question itself.\n2. Load environment variables from .env files using the python-dotenv package.\n3. For API keys, use the following environment variables:\n   - BINANCE_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_CBB_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_CFB_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_NBA_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_NFL_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\n\n4. Available Data Sources Information:\n   ALL AVAILABLE API CONFIGURATIONS:\n   - Binance (Category: crypto):\n     * API Key: BINANCE_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.binance.com/api/v3\n     * proxy endpoint: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\n   - Sports Data IO - MLB (Category: sports, Subcategory: baseball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb\n   - Sports Data IO - NBA (Category: sports, Subcategory: basketball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NBA_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nba\n   - Sports Data IO - NFL (Category: sports, Subcategory: football):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NFL_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nfl\n   - Sports Data IO - NHL (Category: sports, Subcategory: hockey):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nhl\n   - Sports Data IO - CFB (Category: sports, Subcategory: college football):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_CFB_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/cfb\n   - Sports Data IO - CBB (Category: sports, Subcategory: college basketball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_CBB_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/cbb\n\n5. Query Type Specific Information:\n\n\n6. NEVER include actual API key values in the code, always load them from environment variables.\n\n7. IMPORTANT FOR ALL DATA SOURCES: If a proxy endpoint is provided alongside a primary endpoint, you MUST implement the fallback mechanism described above. This is critical for reliability:\n   - Always try the proxy endpoint first\n   - If the proxy fails, fall back to the primary endpoint\n   - Use appropriate timeout values (10 seconds recommended)\n   - Include proper error handling with try/except blocks\n\nThe code should be completely self-contained and runnable with no arguments.\n\n\nHere's a complete code example that shows how to solve this type of problem:\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nMLB market resolver\np1 = Texas Rangers\np2 = Oakland Athletics\np3 = 50-50 (canceled / tie)\np4 = Too early / in-progress\n\"\"\"\nimport os, time, logging, re, requests\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\n# \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 configuration \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nload_dotenv()\nAPI_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\nif not API_KEY:\n    raise ValueError(\"Missing SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\nHEADERS = {\"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key\": API_KEY}\n\nlogging.basicConfig(\n    level=logging.DEBUG,\n    format=\"%(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] %(message)s\",\n    handlers=[logging.StreamHandler()])\nlogging.getLogger().addFilter(\n    lambda r: setattr(r, \"msg\",\n        re.sub(re.escape(API_KEY), \"******\", r.getMessage())) or True)\nlog = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n# \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 generic GET wrapper \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\ndef _get(url, tag, retries=3, backoff=1.5):\n    for i in range(retries):\n        log.debug(f\"[{tag}] \u2192 {url}\")\n        r = requests.get(url, headers=HEADERS, timeout=10)\n        log.debug(f\"[{tag}] \u2190 {r.status_code} {r.reason}\")\n        if r.ok:\n            log.debug(f\"[{tag}] payload length: {len(r.json())}\")\n            return r.json()\n        if r.status_code in (401, 403):\n            log.error(f\"[{tag}] blocked \u2014 not in plan\");

Where p1 corresponds to Fucsovics, p2 to Rinderknech, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.

Recommendation found: p3.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p3\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Rinderknech, Price: 0.0055, ID: 34693570737187592826546710942113293796546016501669321872840931545024400383071, Winner: No\n- Token: Fucsovics, Price: 0.9945, ID: 91777299787795975729336093700516972339846844120409815357230537073000177342358, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Fucsovics, p2 to Rinderknech, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Fucsovics, p2 = Rinderknech\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Fucsovics outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Where p1 corresponds to Fucsovics, p2 to Rinderknech, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749638541 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-11 10:42:21 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p3. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\n# Load environment variables\nload_dotenv()\nAPI_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_CBB_API_KEY\")\nif not API_KEY:\n    raise ValueError(\"Missing SPORTS_DATA_IO_CBB_API_KEY\")\n\n# Configuration for headers and endpoints\nHEADERS = {\"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key\": API_KEY}\nPRIMARY_ENDPOINT = \"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/cbb/scores/json\"\nPROXY_ENDPOINT = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/cbb-proxy\"\n\n# Function to make API requests\ndef make_request(endpoint, path):\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(f\"{endpoint}/{path}\", headers=HEADERS, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        return response.json()\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error during request to {endpoint}/{path}: {e}\")\n        return None\n\n# Function to resolve the market based on the match result\ndef resolve_market(match_date, player1, player2):\n    # Format the date for the API request\n    formatted_date = datetime.strptime(match_date, \"%Y-%m-%d\").strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n    games_today = make_request(PROXY_ENDPOINT, f\"GamesByDate/{formatted_date}\")\n\n    if not games_today:\n        games_today = make_request(PRIMARY_ENDPOINT, f\"GamesByDate/{formatted_date}\")\n        if not games_today:\n            return \"recommendation: p3\"  # Return 50-50 if data is unavailable\n\n    # Search for the specific match\n    for game in games_today:\n        if player1 in game['Players'] and player2 in game['Players']:\n            if game['Status'] == \"Final\":\n                winner = game['Winner']\n                if winner == player1:\n                    return \"recommendation: p2\"  # Rinderknech wins\n                elif winner == player2:\n                    return \"recommendation: p1\"  # Fucsovics wins\n            elif game['Status'] in [\"Canceled\", \"Postponed\"]:\n                return \"recommendation: p3\"  # Match canceled or postponed\n\n    # If no specific match found or match is still scheduled\n    return \"recommendation: p3\"  # Return 50-50 if match is not completed or found\n\n# Main execution function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    match_date = \"2025-06-11\"\n    player1 = \"Arthur Rinderknech\"\n    player2 = \"Marton Fucsovics\"\n    result = resolve_market(match_date, player1, player2)\n    print(result)\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nError during request to https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/cbb-proxy/GamesByDate/2025-06-11: 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/cbb-proxy/GamesByDate/2025-06-11\nError during request to https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/cbb/scores/json/GamesByDate/2025-06-11: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/cbb/scores/json/GamesByDate/2025-06-11\nrecommendation: p3\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Where p1 corresponds to Fucsovics, p2 to Rinderknech, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Fucsovics, p2 = Rinderknech\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Fucsovics outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749638541 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-11 10:42:21 UTC",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Boss Open: Rinderknech vs. Fucsovics, description: Arthur Rinderknech and Marton Fucsovics are scheduled to play each other in a second round matchup in the Boss Open mens singles tournament on June 11, 2025, at 5:00 AM ET. \n\nThis market will resolve to \"Rinderknech\" if Arthur Rinderknech advances against Marton Fucsovics in the second round of the Boss Open mens singles tournament.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Fucsovics\" if Marton Fucsovics advances against Arthur Rinderknech in the second round of the Boss Open mens singles tournament.\n\nIf the match ends in a tie, is canceled, or delayed beyond July 11, 2025, this market will resolve to 50-50.\n\nThe primary resolution source will be official information from the Boss Open (https://bossopen.com/en/home), however, a consensus of credible reporting may also be used. market_id: 551432\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Fucsovics, p2 to Rinderknech, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749638541 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-11 10:42:21 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p3. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please ensure the API keys are valid and the endpoints are correct. Consider using the primary resolution source (Boss Open official site) as specified in the query for accurate data retrieval.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\n# Load environment variables\nload_dotenv()\n\n# API keys loaded from environment variables\nAPI_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_CBB_API_KEY\")\nif not API_KEY:\n    raise ValueError(\"Missing SPORTS_DATA_IO_CBB_API_KEY\")\n\n# Headers for API requests\nHEADERS = {\"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key\": API_KEY}\n\n# URL configurations\nPRIMARY_ENDPOINT = \"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/cbb\"\nPROXY_ENDPOINT = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/cbb-proxy\"\n\n# Function to make GET requests to the API\ndef get_data(url, use_proxy=False):\n    endpoint = PROXY_ENDPOINT if use_proxy else PRIMARY_ENDPOINT\n    full_url = f\"{endpoint}{url}\"\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(full_url, headers=HEADERS, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        return response.json()\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        if use_proxy:\n            print(\"Proxy failed, trying primary endpoint.\")\n            return get_data(url, use_proxy=False)\n        else:\n            print(f\"Failed to retrieve data: {e}\")\n            return None\n\n# Function to determine the outcome of the match\ndef resolve_match():\n    # Date and players hardcoded based on the specific event\n    match_date = \"2025-06-11\"\n    player1 = \"Arthur Rinderknech\"\n    player2 = \"Marton Fucsovics\"\n\n    # Format the API request URL\n    url = f\"/scores/json/GamesByDate/{match_date}\"\n\n    # Get data from the API\n    data = get_data(url, use_proxy=True)\n    if data:\n        for game in data:\n            if player1 in game['Players'] and player2 in game['Players']:\n                if game['Status'] == \"Final\":\n                    winner = game['Winner']\n                    if winner == player1:\n                        return \"recommendation: p2\"  # Rinderknech wins\n                    elif winner == player2:\n                        return \"recommendation: p1\"  # Fucsovics wins\n                elif game['Status'] in [\"Canceled\", \"Postponed\"]:\n                    return \"recommendation: p3\"  # Match canceled or postponed\n    return \"recommendation: p3\"  # Default to unknown/50-50 if no conclusive data\n\n# Main execution\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    result = resolve_match()\n    print(result)\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nProxy failed, trying primary endpoint.\nFailed to retrieve data: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/cbb/scores/json/GamesByDate/2025-06-11\nrecommendation: p3\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Where p1 corresponds to Fucsovics, p2 to Rinderknech, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Fucsovics, p2 = Rinderknech\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Fucsovics outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Available Crypto Data Sources:\n    - Binance: Provides cryptocurrency price data for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies\n  * Available Sports Data Sources:\n    - Sports Data IO - MLB (baseball): MLB baseball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NBA (basketball): NBA basketball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NFL (football): NFL football scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NHL (hockey): NHL hockey scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - CFB (college football): College Football (NCAA) scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - CBB (college basketball): College Basketball (NCAA) scores, statistics, and game data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Boss Open: Rinderknech vs. Fucsovics, description: Arthur Rinderknech and Marton Fucsovics are scheduled to play each other in a second round matchup in the Boss Open mens singles tournament on June 11, 2025, at 5:00 AM ET. \n\nThis market will resolve to \"Rinderknech\" if Arthur Rinderknech advances against Marton Fucsovics in the second round of the Boss Open mens singles tournament.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Fucsovics\" if Marton Fucsovics advances against Arthur Rinderknech in the second round of the Boss Open mens singles tournament.\n\nIf the match ends in a tie, is canceled, or delayed beyond July 11, 2025, this market will resolve to 50-50.\n\nThe primary resolution source will be official information from the Boss Open (https://bossopen.com/en/home), however, a consensus of credible reporting may also be used. market_id: 551432\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Fucsovics, p2 to Rinderknech, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe perplexity solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: perplexity\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\"), college football (e.g., \"What was the score of the Alabama game last Saturday?\"), college basketball (e.g., \"What was Duke's score in their last game?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749638541 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-11 10:42:21 UTC",
