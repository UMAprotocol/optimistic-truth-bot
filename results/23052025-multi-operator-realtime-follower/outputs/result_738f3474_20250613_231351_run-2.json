Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nRoute the query to the perplexity solver for a different analytical approach.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the ETH/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ETH_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance ETH/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 551334\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.

Recommendation found: p3.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p3\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.995, ID: 81892571958084597408432657109969453649781591772316811195493997584477673504819, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.005, ID: 13142581705029148980353645173307404655634245052939095918381344565861115443480, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Ethereum Up or Down - June 13, 6 PM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for ETH/USDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the ETH/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ETH_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance ETH/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 551334\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749856040 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-13 23:07:20 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Review and ensure the API call is correctly fetching data.

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve whether Ethereum (ETH) went up or down based on the 1-hour candle starting at June 13, 6 PM ET (which is 10 PM UTC). The resolution depends on the percentage change of the ETH/USDT pair on Binance for that specific candle. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Down, p2 is Up, and p3 is unknown.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the exact time window. The candle starts at 6 PM ET, which converts to 22:00 UTC on June 13, 2025. The 1-hour candle would end at 7 PM ET (23:00 UTC). The percentage change displayed on Binance for that candle is the key data point.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the ETH price on June 13. For example, result [2] states the live price of Ethereum as $2,550.27, and result [3] mentions ETH testing resistance at $3,480 on June 13. However, these might be from different times. Result [8] from Binance Square on June 13, 00:08 AM UTC notes ETH dropped below 2,600 USDT to 2,596.07. Result [34] from June 13, 2025, at 1:00 PM UTC mentions ETH testing resistance at $3,480, but this seems inconsistent with other data points.\n\nWait, there's a discrepancy here. Some sources mention higher prices around $3,480, while others report lower figures around $2,500. This could be due to different timestamps. The user's query is specifically about the 1-hour window from 22:00 to 23:00 UTC on June 13. \n\nResult [43] from CoinDesk on June 13, 2025, states that ETH fell sharply from $2,770 to $2,530 over 24 hours, with a low of $2,477.71. The article mentions a 7% drop due to geopolitical tensions. However, this is a 24-hour change, not the specific 1-hour window. \n\nResult [44] and [48] discuss a sharp drop to around $2,500 on June 13, but again, the exact timing isn't clear. Result [46] from Blockchain.news on June 13, 2025, reports Ethereum sinking nearly 9% daily, with ETH at $2,517. \n\nThe critical point is the percentage change during the specific 1-hour candle. If the change is >=0%, it's Up (p2); otherwise, Down (p1). The resolution source is Binance's ETH/USDT pair, specifically the 1H candle's change value. \n\nGiven the market's end time (23:00 UTC), I need to check if there's data confirming the change during that hour. Result [8] from Binance Square at 00:08 AM UTC on June 13 shows ETH at 2,596.07, but that's earlier in the day. The geopolitical event in result [43] caused a drop, but the exact timing of the drop relative to the 22:00-23:00 UTC window is unclear. \n\nSince the user's current timestamp is June 13, 2025, 23:07:20 UTC, the 1-hour candle from 22:00 to 23:00 UTC would have just closed. If the change during that hour was negative, the resolution is p1 (Down). If it was positive, p2 (Up). \n\nHowever, the provided search results don't explicitly state the percentage change for that exact hour. The closest is result [43], which mentions a 7% drop over 24 hours, but that's a broader timeframe. Without explicit data for the 22:00-23:00 UTC window, I might have to infer based on the overall trend. \n\nGiven the geopolitical tensions causing a sell-off, it's likely the price continued to drop during that hour. However, without concrete data from Binance for that specific candle, the resolution would default to p4 if the information isn't available. But the user instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info exists. \n\nConsidering the market's end time (23:00 UTC) and the current time (23:07 UTC), the data should be available. If the change was negative, resolve to p1. If the change was positive, p2. But the search results don't provide the exact figure. \n\nWait, result [34] from June 13, 1:00 PM UTC mentions ETH testing resistance at $3,480, but this might be a different timezone or an error. Result [52] from Binance's Ethereum page states the live price as $2,537.46 as of the current time (June 13, 23:07 UTC). If the price at 22:00 was higher than at 23:00, the change is negative. \n\nAssuming the price was decreasing throughout the day, especially with the geopolitical news, the 1-hour candle from 22:00-23:00 UTC likely had a negative change. Therefore, the resolution would be p1 (Down). However, without explicit data, this is an assumption. But per the user's instructions, if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. Given the overall downward trend reported, the probable outcome is Down.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749856040 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-13 23:07:20 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query.

But the user instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info exists. \n\nConsidering the market's end time (23:00 UTC) and the current time (23:07 UTC), the data should be available. If the change was negative, resolve to p1. If the change was positive, p2. But the search results don't provide the exact figure. \n\nWait, result [34] from June 13, 1:00 PM UTC mentions ETH testing resistance at $3,480, but this might be a different timezone or an error. Result [52] from Binance's Ethereum page states the live price as $2,537.46 as of the current time (June 13, 23:07 UTC). If the price at 22:00 was higher than at 23:00, the change is negative. \n\nAssuming the price was decreasing throughout the day, especially with the geopolitical news, the 1-hour candle from 22:00-23:00 UTC likely had a negative change. Therefore, the resolution would be p1 (Down). However, without explicit data, this is an assumption. But per the user's instructions, if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. Given the overall downward trend reported, the probable outcome is Down.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.995, ID: 81892571958084597408432657109969453649781591772316811195493997584477673504819, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.005, ID: 13142581705029148980353645173307404655634245052939095918381344565861115443480, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

      "routing_phase": 1,
      "prompt": null,
      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market that depends on whether the ETH/USDT 1-hour candle on Binance from June 13, 6 PM ET (which is 22:00 UTC) had a non-negative percentage change. The current timestamp is June 13, 2025, 23:07:20 UTC, so the candle in question (22:00-23:00 UTC) has already closed.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the exact time conversion from ET to UTC. Since June 13 is during Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), which is UTC-4, 6 PM EDT converts to 22:00 UTC. That matches the user's note about the 1-hour candle from 22:00 to 23:00 UTC.\n\nNext, I should check the provided search results for data related to that specific time frame. Looking at the sources, several mention Binance's ETH/USDT pair. For example, source [4] from cryptonews.net gives a price prediction for June 13, 2025, mentioning ETH was around $2,755. Source [5] on CoinMarketCap shows the ETH to USDT rate on June 13 as 2,562.48 USDT with a -3.35% change. However, this might be the daily change, not the specific 1-hour candle.\n\nSource [8] from blockchain.news discusses Ethereum traders shifting to shorts as of June 13, 12:00 UTC, with ETH around $2,450. But this is earlier than the 22:00 candle. Source [10] from cryptometer.io lists large trades on Binance for June 13, including sells at 1,306.34 ETH and 1,169.05 ETH, but these are individual trades, not the overall candle change.\n\nSource [45] from coingecko.com's historical data for June 13 shows the closing price as N/A, but the previous day's close was $2,653.16. However, this might not be the 1-hour specific data. Source [44] from CoinMarketCap's ETH/USDT page on June 13 lists the rate as 2,562.48 USDT, but again, this could be the daily close.\n\nThe key here is to find the percentage change for the exact 1-hour window. The Binance API (source [25]) provides kline/candlestick data, and sources [1], [2], [12], [18], [22], [25], [36] discuss methods to retrieve historical data. However, the provided search results don't have the exact 1-hour candle data for June 13, 22:00-23:00 UTC. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit data in the sources, I need to infer. The user's personalization instructs to use the specified URL (Binance ETH/USDT) and assume the most probable outcome if data isn't available. Since the current time is past the candle's close, and assuming no contradictory info, if the change isn't explicitly found, we might default to the most probable outcome. However, source [45] mentions a price prediction for June 13 with a bullish structure holding above $2,745, but the actual data from CoinMarketCap [5] shows a decrease. \n\nWait, source [5] (CoinMarketCap) shows on June 13, the ETH/USDT rate was 2,562.48, a -3.35% change. But this is the 24h change, not the 1-hour. The 1-hour candle's change isn't directly provided. Without explicit data, but considering the market resolves based on Binance's displayed change for that candle, and given the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome if data isn't available, but the event date is in the past, we need to check if any sources mention the specific hour. \n\nSource [8] mentions Ethereum price dropped to $2,450 around 12:00 UTC on June 13, but that's earlier. Source [45] from June 13's prediction mentions a bullish structure above $2,745, but actual data might differ. Since the exact 1-hour change isn't found, but the user's additional instruction says to re-evaluate Binance data for 22:00-23:00 UTC, and given the current time is after that window, perhaps the change was negative. However, without concrete data, it's risky. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The query's ancillary data defines p1 as Down (change <0), p2 as Up (change >=0). If we can't find the exact change, but looking at the broader context: sources [4], [45] suggest some bullishness, but [5], [8] indicate downward pressure. However, these are for different time frames. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and the requirement to resolve based on Binance's data, and lacking the exact percentage, but the user's instruction says to use the specified URL and if no info, assume the most probable. Since the current time is after the event, and assuming the data isn't present in the sources, perhaps the resolution is p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The conditions here are the candle's change >=0. If we can't verify, but the market's resolution depends on Binance's displayed change, and we don't have that data, perhaps the answer is p4. However, the user's additional instruction says to re-evaluate Binance data specifically for that hour. \n\nWait, source [10] from cryptometer.io lists a sell of 1,306.34 ETH at 3,200,529 USDT on June 13, which would be around $2,450 per ETH (3,200,529 / 1,306.34 \u2248 2,450). If that trade was in the 22:00-23:00 window, maybe the price decreased. But without knowing the open and close of the candle, we can't calculate the percentage change. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit data, but the requirement to resolve, and the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome if no info, I might have to default to p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions in the prompt. The prompt's ancillary data doesn't specify a default, but the resolution conditions are p1: Down, p2: Up. If we can't determine, perhaps p3 (50-50), but the user's instruction says if no info, assume the most probable. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the broader market sentiment: source [8] mentions Ethereum traders shifting to shorts, indicating bearish sentiment. Source [45] mentions a price prediction for June 13 with a bullish structure, but actual data from CoinMarketCap [5] shows a -3.35% 24h change. If the 1-hour candle during 22:00-23:00 UTC was part of a downward trend, perhaps the change was negative. But this is speculative. \n\nSince the exact data isn't present in the provided sources, and per the user's instructions, if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. Given the overall negative 24h change, but the 1-hour could be different. Without concrete data, but the event time has passed, the correct resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The problem is that we don't have the data, so perhaps the answer is p4. But the user's additional instruction says to re-evaluate Binance data for that hour and align with market sentiment. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please re-evaluate the data specifically from Binance for the 1-hour candle from 22:00 to 23:00 UTC on June 13, 2025, and ensure the recommendation aligns with the market sentiment.\"\n\nGiven that, but the provided search results don't have the exact 1-hour data. However, source [10] from cryptometer.io lists a large sell order of 1,306.34 ETH at 3,200,529 USDT on June 13, which is approximately $2,450 per ETH. If this occurred in the 22:00-23:00 window, and assuming the open was higher, the change would be negative. But without knowing the open and close, it's impossible to be certain. \n\nAlternatively, source [5] on CoinMarketCap shows the ETH/USDT rate on June 13 as 2,562.48, which is a -3.35% change over 24h. If the 1-hour candle was part of this downward trend, perhaps it was negative. However, the 24h change includes the entire day, so the specific hour could have been positive. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and lack of explicit data, but the instruction to assume the most probable outcome, and considering the market sentiment from source [8] (traders shifting to shorts), it's plausible the 1-hour change was negative. Therefore, the resolution would be p1 (Down). However, this is an assumption. \n\nAlternatively, if the candle's close was higher than its open, it's p2. Without the exact numbers, but the user's instruction to use Binance's data, and given that the query's resolution source is Binance's displayed change for that candle, and we can't access it, perhaps the answer is p4. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable. Since the market is about whether the change was >=0, and without data, it's 50-50, but the user's ancillary data says p3 is 0.5. However, the user's instruction says to avoid p3 unless necessary. \n\nWait, the resolution conditions are p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: 50-50. The user's personalization says if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. If we can't determine, but the market is about a specific candle, and we can't get the data, perhaps the answer is p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since the event is in the past, and we can't verify, but the user's instruction says to use the specified URL (Binance), which we can't access, perhaps the answer is p4. But the user's additional instruction says to re-evaluate Binance data, implying that the data should be available. \n\nGiven the conflict, but the current timestamp is after the event, and the user's instruction to resolve based on Binance's data, but the provided search results don't have the exact 1-hour change, I have to conclude that there's insufficient data to confirm the change, hence p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable. Given the 24h change was negative, but the specific hour could vary, but without data, it's uncertain. Therefore, the safest recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749856040 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-13 23:07:20 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please re-evaluate the data specifically from Binance for the 1-hour candle from 22:00 to 23:00 UTC on June 13, 2025, and ensure the recommendation aligns with the market sentiment.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market that depends on whether the ETH/USDT 1-hour candle on Binance from June 13, 6 PM ET (which is 22:00 UTC) had a non-negative percentage change. The current timestamp is June 13, 2025, 23:07:20 UTC, so the candle in question (22:00-23:00 UTC) has already closed.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the exact time conversion from ET to UTC. Since June 13 is during Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), which is UTC-4, 6 PM EDT converts to 22:00 UTC. That matches the user's note about the 1-hour candle from 22:00 to 23:00 UTC.\n\nNext, I should check the provided search results for data related to that specific time frame. Looking at the sources, several mention Binance's ETH/USDT pair. For example, source [4] from cryptonews.net gives a price prediction for June 13, 2025, mentioning ETH was around $2,755. Source [5] on CoinMarketCap shows the ETH to USDT rate on June 13 as 2,562.48 USDT with a -3.35% change. However, this might be the daily change, not the specific 1-hour candle.\n\nSource [8] from blockchain.news discusses Ethereum traders shifting to shorts as of June 13, 12:00 UTC, with ETH around $2,450. But this is earlier than the 22:00 candle. Source [10] from cryptometer.io lists large trades on Binance for June 13, including sells at 1,306.34 ETH and 1,169.05 ETH, but these are individual trades, not the overall candle change.\n\nSource [45] from coingecko.com's historical data for June 13 shows the closing price as N/A, but the previous day's close was $2,653.16. However, this might not be the 1-hour specific data. Source [44] from CoinMarketCap's ETH/USDT page on June 13 lists the rate as 2,562.48 USDT, but again, this could be the daily close.\n\nThe key here is to find the percentage change for the exact 1-hour window. The Binance API (source [25]) provides kline/candlestick data, and sources [1], [2], [12], [18], [22], [25], [36] discuss methods to retrieve historical data. However, the provided search results don't have the exact 1-hour candle data for June 13, 22:00-23:00 UTC. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit data in the sources, I need to infer. The user's personalization instructs to use the specified URL (Binance ETH/USDT) and assume the most probable outcome if data isn't available. Since the current time is past the candle's close, and assuming no contradictory info, if the change isn't explicitly found, we might default to the most probable outcome. However, source [45] mentions a price prediction for June 13 with a bullish structure holding above $2,745, but the actual data from CoinMarketCap [5] shows a decrease. \n\nWait, source [5] (CoinMarketCap) shows on June 13, the ETH/USDT rate was 2,562.48, a -3.35% change. But this is the 24h change, not the 1-hour. The 1-hour candle's change isn't directly provided. Without explicit data, but considering the market resolves based on Binance's displayed change for that candle, and given the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome if data isn't available, but the event date is in the past, we need to check if any sources mention the specific hour. \n\nSource [8] mentions Ethereum price dropped to $2,450 around 12:00 UTC on June 13, but that's earlier. Source [45] from June 13's prediction mentions a bullish structure above $2,745, but actual data might differ. Since the exact 1-hour change isn't found, but the user's additional instruction says to re-evaluate Binance data for 22:00-23:00 UTC, and given the current time is after that window, perhaps the change was negative. However, without concrete data, it's risky. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The query's ancillary data defines p1 as Down (change <0), p2 as Up (change >=0). If we can't find the exact change, but looking at the broader context: sources [4], [45] suggest some bullishness, but [5], [8] indicate downward pressure. However, these are for different time frames. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and the requirement to resolve based on Binance's data, and lacking the exact percentage, but the user's instruction says to use the specified URL and if no info, assume the most probable. Since the current time is after the event, and assuming the data isn't present in the sources, perhaps the resolution is p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The conditions here are the candle's change >=0. If we can't verify, but the market's resolution depends on Binance's displayed change, and we don't have that data, perhaps the answer is p4. However, the user's additional instruction says to re-evaluate Binance data specifically for that hour. \n\nWait, source [10] from cryptometer.io lists a sell of 1,306.34 ETH at 3,200,529 USDT on June 13, which would be around $2,450 per ETH (3,200,529 / 1,306.34 \u2248 2,450). If that trade was in the 22:00-23:00 window, maybe the price decreased. But without knowing the open and close of the candle, we can't calculate the percentage change. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit data, but the requirement to resolve, and the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome if no info, I might have to default to p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions in the prompt. The prompt's ancillary data doesn't specify a default, but the resolution conditions are p1: Down, p2: Up. If we can't determine, perhaps p3 (50-50), but the user's instruction says if no info, assume the most probable. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the broader market sentiment: source [8] mentions Ethereum traders shifting to shorts, indicating bearish sentiment. Source [45] mentions a price prediction for June 13 with a bullish structure, but actual data from CoinMarketCap [5] shows a -3.35% 24h change. If the 1-hour candle during 22:00-23:00 UTC was part of a downward trend, perhaps the change was negative. But this is speculative. \n\nSince the exact data isn't present in the provided sources, and per the user's instructions, if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. Given the overall negative 24h change, but the 1-hour could be different. Without concrete data, but the event time has passed, the correct resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The problem is that we don't have the data, so perhaps the answer is p4. But the user's additional instruction says to re-evaluate Binance data for that hour and align with market sentiment. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please re-evaluate the data specifically from Binance for the 1-hour candle from 22:00 to 23:00 UTC on June 13, 2025, and ensure the recommendation aligns with the market sentiment.\"\n\nGiven that, but the provided search results don't have the exact 1-hour data. However, source [10] from cryptometer.io lists a large sell order of 1,306.34 ETH at 3,200,529 USDT on June 13, which is approximately $2,450 per ETH. If this occurred in the 22:00-23:00 window, and assuming the open was higher, the change would be negative. But without knowing the open and close, it's impossible to be certain. \n\nAlternatively, source [5] on CoinMarketCap shows the ETH/USDT rate on June 13 as 2,562.48, which is a -3.35% change over 24h. If the 1-hour candle was part of this downward trend, perhaps it was negative. However, the 24h change includes the entire day, so the specific hour could have been positive. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and lack of explicit data, but the instruction to assume the most probable outcome, and considering the market sentiment from source [8] (traders shifting to shorts), it's plausible the 1-hour change was negative. Therefore, the resolution would be p1 (Down). However, this is an assumption. \n\nAlternatively, if the candle's close was higher than its open, it's p2. Without the exact numbers, but the user's instruction to use Binance's data, and given that the query's resolution source is Binance's displayed change for that candle, and we can't access it, perhaps the answer is p4. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable. Since the market is about whether the change was >=0, and without data, it's 50-50, but the user's ancillary data says p3 is 0.5. However, the user's instruction says to avoid p3 unless necessary. \n\nWait, the resolution conditions are p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: 50-50. The user's personalization says if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. If we can't determine, but the market is about a specific candle, and we can't get the data, perhaps the answer is p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since the event is in the past, and we can't verify, but the user's instruction says to use the specified URL (Binance), which we can't access, perhaps the answer is p4. But the user's additional instruction says to re-evaluate Binance data, implying that the data should be available. \n\nGiven the conflict, but the current timestamp is after the event, and the user's instruction to resolve based on Binance's data, but the provided search results don't have the exact 1-hour change, I have to conclude that there's insufficient data to confirm the change, hence p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable. Given the 24h change was negative, but the specific hour could vary, but without data, it's uncertain. Therefore, the safest recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.995, ID: 81892571958084597408432657109969453649781591772316811195493997584477673504819, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.005, ID: 13142581705029148980353645173307404655634245052939095918381344565861115443480, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.
