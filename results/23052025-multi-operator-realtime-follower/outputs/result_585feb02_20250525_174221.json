      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if another team will have the second-highest constructor score at the 2025 Monaco Grand Prix. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the results of the Monaco GP. The search results [3], [4], [6], [8], [10] all confirm that McLaren's Lando Norris won the race, with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc in second and McLaren's Oscar Piastri in third. The constructor points are awarded based on both drivers' results. \n\nLooking at the constructor standings for the race, each team's points are the sum of their two drivers. McLaren had Norris (1st, 25 points) and Piastri (3rd, 15 points), totaling 40 points. Ferrari had Leclerc (2nd, 18 points) and Hamilton (5th, 10 points), totaling 28 points. Red Bull's Verstappen was 4th (12 points) and Tsunoda 17th (0 points), so 12 points. \n\nSo McLaren is first with 40, Ferrari second with 28. The question is whether \"another team\" (not McLaren) is second. Since Ferrari is second, the answer is Yes, so p2. The sources [5], [12] also show McLaren leading constructors, with Ferrari in fourth overall but second in this race. No ties here, so no need for alphabetical resolution. The event happened on May 25, 2025, so no cancellation issues. All info is confirmed by F1 sources. Recommendation: p2.\n</think>\n\n# 2025 Monaco Grand Prix Constructor Standings Analysis\n\nThe 2025 Monaco Grand Prix, held on May 25, 2025, at the Circuit de Monaco, concluded with McLaren-Mercedes securing a dominant victory through Lando Norris, who converted pole position into a race win[3][4][6][8][10]. Oscar Piastri, his teammate, finished third, contributing significant points to the team's constructor total[3][4][6][8][10]. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton finished second and fifth, respectively, while Red Bull Racing-Honda RBPT's Max Verstappen claimed fourth place[3][4][6][8][10]. This analysis examines whether another team achieved the second-highest constructor score at this event.\n\n## Constructor Points Allocation at the Monaco Grand Prix\n\n### Scoring System Overview\nFormula 1 awards constructor points based on the combined results of a team's two drivers in each race. The points system for the 2025 season allocates 25 points for first place, 18 for second, 15 for third, 12 for fourth, 10 for fifth, and decreasing increments down to one point for tenth place[1][5][7][9][12]. Sprint race points, though part of the championship, do not factor into individual Grand Prix constructor totals[1][5][7][9][12].\n\n### McLaren-Mercedes' Performance\nMcLaren-Mercedes earned maximum points at Monaco, with Norris taking 25 points for his victory and Piastri adding 15 points for third place[3][4][6][8][10]. This gave the team a total of **40 constructor points** for the event, cementing their position as the top-scoring team[3][4][6][8][10].\n\n### Ferrari's Results\nFerrari's Leclerc secured 18 points for his second-place finish, while Hamilton contributed 10 points for fifth place[3][4][6][8][10]. This resulted in a **28-point haul** for Ferrari, making them the second-highest-scoring constructor at the Monaco Grand Prix[3][4][6][8][10].\n\n### Red Bull Racing-Honda RBPT's Output\nRed Bull's Verstappen earned 12 points for fourth place, but teammate Yuki Tsunoda failed to score after finishing 17th[3][4][6][8][10]. This limited Red Bull's constructor total to **12 points**, placing them third among teams at this event[3][4][6][8][10].\n\n## Comparative Analysis of Constructor Standings\n\n### Margin Between Ferrari and Red Bull\nFerrari's 28-point total at Monaco gave them a **16-point advantage** over Red Bull's 12 points[3][4][6][8][10]. This substantial gap confirms Ferrari's clear position as the second-highest-scoring team at the event. The Racing Bulls (formerly AlphaTauri) and Williams also scored points but trailed significantly, with 8 and 3 points respectively[3][4][6][8][10].\n\n### Historical Context\nMcLaren's 1-3 finish marked their strongest Monaco performance since 2021, while Ferrari's double-points finish continued their consistent form in the 2025 season[5][7][9][12]. Red Bull's relatively low score at Monaco contrasted with their earlier season performances, where Verstappen had secured multiple podium finishes[1][5][7][9][12].\n\n## Resolution Criteria Evaluation\n\n### Tiebreaker Considerations\nThe race results showed no tie between constructor teams for second place. Ferrari's 28 points unequivocally surpassed Red Bull's 12 points, eliminating the need for alphabetical resolution[3][4][6][8][10].\n\n### Event Completion Verification\nAll sources confirm the Monaco Grand Prix concluded as scheduled on May 25, 2025, with no cancellations or postponements affecting the outcome[3][4][6][8][10][11]. The F1-sanctioned results published immediately after the race provide definitive resolution data[3][4][6][8][10][12].\n\n## Conclusion\nBased on verified results from the 2025 Monaco Grand Prix, Ferrari Scuderia HP achieved the second-highest constructor score with 28 points, trailing only McLaren-Mercedes' 40 points[3][4][6][8][10]. This satisfies the market resolution condition for \"Yes\" (p2), as another team (Ferrari) indeed secured the second-highest constructor total at the event.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1748194847 Current Date and Time: 2025-05-25 17:40:47 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if another team will have the second-highest constructor score at the 2025 Monaco Grand Prix. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the results of the Monaco GP. The search results [3], [4], [6], [8], [10] all confirm that McLaren's Lando Norris won the race, with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc in second and McLaren's Oscar Piastri in third. The constructor points are awarded based on both drivers' results. \n\nLooking at the constructor standings for the race, each team's points are the sum of their two drivers. McLaren had Norris (1st, 25 points) and Piastri (3rd, 15 points), totaling 40 points. Ferrari had Leclerc (2nd, 18 points) and Hamilton (5th, 10 points), totaling 28 points. Red Bull's Verstappen was 4th (12 points) and Tsunoda 17th (0 points), so 12 points. \n\nSo McLaren is first with 40, Ferrari second with 28. The question is whether \"another team\" (not McLaren) is second. Since Ferrari is second, the answer is Yes, so p2. The sources [5], [12] also show McLaren leading constructors, with Ferrari in fourth overall but second in this race. No ties here, so no need for alphabetical resolution. The event happened on May 25, 2025, so no cancellation issues. All info is confirmed by F1 sources. Recommendation: p2.\n</think>\n\n# 2025 Monaco Grand Prix Constructor Standings Analysis\n\nThe 2025 Monaco Grand Prix, held on May 25, 2025, at the Circuit de Monaco, concluded with McLaren-Mercedes securing a dominant victory through Lando Norris, who converted pole position into a race win[3][4][6][8][10]. Oscar Piastri, his teammate, finished third, contributing significant points to the team's constructor total[3][4][6][8][10]. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton finished second and fifth, respectively, while Red Bull Racing-Honda RBPT's Max Verstappen claimed fourth place[3][4][6][8][10]. This analysis examines whether another team achieved the second-highest constructor score at this event.\n\n## Constructor Points Allocation at the Monaco Grand Prix\n\n### Scoring System Overview\nFormula 1 awards constructor points based on the combined results of a team's two drivers in each race. The points system for the 2025 season allocates 25 points for first place, 18 for second, 15 for third, 12 for fourth, 10 for fifth, and decreasing increments down to one point for tenth place[1][5][7][9][12]. Sprint race points, though part of the championship, do not factor into individual Grand Prix constructor totals[1][5][7][9][12].\n\n### McLaren-Mercedes' Performance\nMcLaren-Mercedes earned maximum points at Monaco, with Norris taking 25 points for his victory and Piastri adding 15 points for third place[3][4][6][8][10]. This gave the team a total of **40 constructor points** for the event, cementing their position as the top-scoring team[3][4][6][8][10].\n\n### Ferrari's Results\nFerrari's Leclerc secured 18 points for his second-place finish, while Hamilton contributed 10 points for fifth place[3][4][6][8][10]. This resulted in a **28-point haul** for Ferrari, making them the second-highest-scoring constructor at the Monaco Grand Prix[3][4][6][8][10].\n\n### Red Bull Racing-Honda RBPT's Output\nRed Bull's Verstappen earned 12 points for fourth place, but teammate Yuki Tsunoda failed to score after finishing 17th[3][4][6][8][10]. This limited Red Bull's constructor total to **12 points**, placing them third among teams at this event[3][4][6][8][10].\n\n## Comparative Analysis of Constructor Standings\n\n### Margin Between Ferrari and Red Bull\nFerrari's 28-point total at Monaco gave them a **16-point advantage** over Red Bull's 12 points[3][4][6][8][10]. This substantial gap confirms Ferrari's clear position as the second-highest-scoring team at the event. The Racing Bulls (formerly AlphaTauri) and Williams also scored points but trailed significantly, with 8 and 3 points respectively[3][4][6][8][10].\n\n### Historical Context\nMcLaren's 1-3 finish marked their strongest Monaco performance since 2021, while Ferrari's double-points finish continued their consistent form in the 2025 season[5][7][9][12]. Red Bull's relatively low score at Monaco contrasted with their earlier season performances, where Verstappen had secured multiple podium finishes[1][5][7][9][12].\n\n## Resolution Criteria Evaluation\n\n### Tiebreaker Considerations\nThe race results showed no tie between constructor teams for second place. Ferrari's 28 points unequivocally surpassed Red Bull's 12 points, eliminating the need for alphabetical resolution[3][4][6][8][10].\n\n### Event Completion Verification\nAll sources confirm the Monaco Grand Prix concluded as scheduled on May 25, 2025, with no cancellations or postponements affecting the outcome[3][4][6][8][10][11]. The F1-sanctioned results published immediately after the race provide definitive resolution data[3][4][6][8][10][12].\n\n## Conclusion\nBased on verified results from the 2025 Monaco Grand Prix, Ferrari Scuderia HP achieved the second-highest constructor score with 28 points, trailing only McLaren-Mercedes' 40 points[3][4][6][8][10]. This satisfies the market resolution condition for \"Yes\" (p2), as another team (Ferrari) indeed secured the second-highest constructor total at the event.\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.25, ID: 24436400223496533686651881585339437926456641654346912564446803181522815062568, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.75, ID: 54134184984520095625761715461371587045345299291861390800207625993118898166600, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors NO outcome (0.750 = 75.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
