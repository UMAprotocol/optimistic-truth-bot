Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.

Recommendation found: p3.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p3\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.165, ID: 41305756840430737315531108323517219941030290709847252865763784111773088921565, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.835, ID: 78094580549170539467943394498666287393417056368377381979969169806753985453968, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.835 = 83.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date.

Recommendation found: p4.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p4\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.165, ID: 41305756840430737315531108323517219941030290709847252865763784111773088921565, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.835, ID: 78094580549170539467943394498666287393417056368377381979969169806753985453968, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.835 = 83.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750256455 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-18 14:20:55 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please ensure the data retrieval is successful and corresponds to the specified date and time.

Recommendation found: p3.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p3\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.165, ID: 41305756840430737315531108323517219941030290709847252865763784111773088921565, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.835, ID: 78094580549170539467943394498666287393417056368377381979969169806753985453968, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.835 = 83.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market prediction about whether Bitcoin's price will go up or down based on the 1-hour candle starting June 18, 9 AM ET (which is 13:00 UTC). The resolution depends on the close price being greater than or equal to the open price for that specific candle on Binance's BTC/USDT pair.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current time. The current timestamp is June 18, 2025, 14:20:55 UTC. The candle in question started at 13:00 UTC and ended at 14:00 UTC. Since the current time is after 14:00 UTC, the candle has closed, and the data should be available.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention Bitcoin's price movements on June 18. For example, result [2] states that Ethereum dropped below 2,500 USDT, but that's ETH, not BTC. Result [4] mentions BTC dropping from $96,500 to $92,000 around 08:00 UTC on June 18, but that's earlier in the day. Result [6] from Blockchain.news as of 10:00 AM UTC on June 18 notes BTC trading at approximately $103,500. However, the key is the 1-hour candle from 13:00 to 14:00 UTC.\n\nResult [19] from CoinMarketCap shows the BTC/USDT rate history. On June 18, the price is listed as 104,938.19 USDT with a 0.33% change. However, this might be the daily close. Result [42] (same as 19) provides a BTC/USDT converter with a rate history, but again, it's daily data.\n\nResult [18] from TradingView's BTCUSDT page mentions the current price as 103,942 USDT, down 0.67% in 24 hours. But this is the 24-hour change, not the specific 1-hour candle.\n\nResult [52] from Binance's order book for BTC/USDT shows the current depth, but not historical candles. The crucial information is the open and close of the 13:00-14:00 UTC candle. Since the current time is past that, the data should be available, but none of the provided search results explicitly state the open and close prices for that exact hour.\n\nHowever, result [6] from Blockchain.news mentions that as of 10:00 AM UTC, Bitcoin was trading at $103,500. Later, result [4] from the same source around 08:00 UTC shows a drop to $92,000, but that's earlier. The key is the 13:00-14:00 window. Without explicit data for that hour, I might need to infer from nearby data points.\n\nGiven that the current timestamp is 14:20 UTC, and the candle closed at 14:00, the close price would be the price at 14:00. If the price at 14:00 was higher than the open at 13:00, it resolves to Up. If not, Down. However, the search results don't have the exact numbers for that hour. \n\nBut result [19] and [42] show the price on June 18 as 104,938.19 USDT with a 0.33% increase. If this is the daily close, it might not help. Alternatively, result [6] mentions a price of $103,500 at 10:00 AM UTC, and if the price increased by 14:00 UTC, that would indicate an upward movement. However, without explicit data, it's challenging.\n\nWait, the user provided a URL (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT) as the resolution source. The instructions say to heavily bias towards the content at this URL. However, the provided search results don't include a direct snapshot of that URL at the relevant time. The closest is result [27] and [39], which are the Binance trade page for BTC/USDT, but the content there doesn't show historical 1-hour candles.\n\nGiven the ancillary data, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is found, we assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The market resolves to Up if close \u2265 open. If the price was rising during that hour, it's Up. Without explicit data, but considering the general market movement on June 18 (some sources mention a dip then a slight recovery), but not enough info. However, the current timestamp is after the event, so if the data isn't available, we might default to p4. But the user instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. However, without clear data, it's uncertain. But the user might expect us to check Binance's data. Since we can't access live data, but the current time is after the event, and the search results don't have the exact candle, perhaps we should resolve to p4. However, the problem is that the event has occurred, so we need to determine based on available data.\n\nWait, result [6] from Blockchain.news on June 18, 10:00 AM UTC, states BTC was at $103,500. If the candle from 13:00-14:00 UTC had an open at 13:00 of, say, $104,000 and closed at 14:00 at $104,500, that's up. But without exact numbers, it's unclear. However, the user's personalization says to use the provided URLs heavily. The resolution source is Binance's BTC/USDT pair, but the provided search results don't have the exact 1-hour candle data. \n\nIn such cases, if the event has occurred but no data is found, the instructions say to resolve based on the most probable outcome. However, without data, it's impossible. Therefore, the correct resolution would be p4 (cannot be resolved). But the user's instruction also says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the market should resolve to Down if the close is below open. But without data, we can't confirm. Since the user provided the Binance URL as the source, but the search results don't include that specific candle's data, and we can't access live data, the safe answer is p4. However, the current time is after the event, so the data should be available. Since the assistant can't access live data, but the search results don't include the specific candle, perhaps the answer is p4. However, the user might expect the assistant to infer from nearby data. For example, if the price was around $104,000 at 13:00 and $103,942 at 14:00 (from result [18]), then close is lower, so Down (p1). But result [18] says the current price is 103,942, which is at the time of the search (14:20 UTC), which is after the candle closed. If the candle closed at 14:00 UTC, and the price then was 103,942, but the open was higher, then it's Down. However, without the exact open and close, it's speculative. \n\nAlternatively, looking at result [19] and [42], the BTC/USDT rate on June 18 is 104,727.32 USDT with a 0.13% increase. If this is the daily change, the 1-hour candle might have varied. But without explicit data, it's uncertain. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and lack of explicit data in the provided search results, the correct resolution is p4. However, the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without data, it's impossible. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750256455 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-18 14:20:55 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market prediction about whether Bitcoin's price will go up or down based on the 1-hour candle starting June 18, 9 AM ET (which is 13:00 UTC). The resolution depends on the close price being greater than or equal to the open price for that specific candle on Binance's BTC/USDT pair.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current time. The current timestamp is June 18, 2025, 14:20:55 UTC. The candle in question started at 13:00 UTC and ended at 14:00 UTC. Since the current time is after 14:00 UTC, the candle has closed, and the data should be available.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention Bitcoin's price movements on June 18. For example, result [2] states that Ethereum dropped below 2,500 USDT, but that's ETH, not BTC. Result [4] mentions BTC dropping from $96,500 to $92,000 around 08:00 UTC on June 18, but that's earlier in the day. Result [6] from Blockchain.news as of 10:00 AM UTC on June 18 notes BTC trading at approximately $103,500. However, the key is the 1-hour candle from 13:00 to 14:00 UTC.\n\nResult [19] from CoinMarketCap shows the BTC/USDT rate history. On June 18, the price is listed as 104,938.19 USDT with a 0.33% change. However, this might be the daily close. Result [42] (same as 19) provides a BTC/USDT converter with a rate history, but again, it's daily data.\n\nResult [18] from TradingView's BTCUSDT page mentions the current price as 103,942 USDT, down 0.67% in 24 hours. But this is the 24-hour change, not the specific 1-hour candle.\n\nResult [52] from Binance's order book for BTC/USDT shows the current depth, but not historical candles. The crucial information is the open and close of the 13:00-14:00 UTC candle. Since the current time is past that, the data should be available, but none of the provided search results explicitly state the open and close prices for that exact hour.\n\nHowever, result [6] from Blockchain.news mentions that as of 10:00 AM UTC, Bitcoin was trading at $103,500. Later, result [4] from the same source around 08:00 UTC shows a drop to $92,000, but that's earlier. The key is the 13:00-14:00 window. Without explicit data for that hour, I might need to infer from nearby data points.\n\nGiven that the current timestamp is 14:20 UTC, and the candle closed at 14:00, the close price would be the price at 14:00. If the price at 14:00 was higher than the open at 13:00, it resolves to Up. If not, Down. However, the search results don't have the exact numbers for that hour. \n\nBut result [19] and [42] show the price on June 18 as 104,938.19 USDT with a 0.33% increase. If this is the daily close, it might not help. Alternatively, result [6] mentions a price of $103,500 at 10:00 AM UTC, and if the price increased by 14:00 UTC, that would indicate an upward movement. However, without explicit data, it's challenging.\n\nWait, the user provided a URL (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT) as the resolution source. The instructions say to heavily bias towards the content at this URL. However, the provided search results don't include a direct snapshot of that URL at the relevant time. The closest is result [27] and [39], which are the Binance trade page for BTC/USDT, but the content there doesn't show historical 1-hour candles.\n\nGiven the ancillary data, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is found, we assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The market resolves to Up if close \u2265 open. If the price was rising during that hour, it's Up. Without explicit data, but considering the general market movement on June 18 (some sources mention a dip then a slight recovery), but not enough info. However, the current timestamp is after the event, so if the data isn't available, we might default to p4. But the user instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. However, without clear data, it's uncertain. But the user might expect us to check Binance's data. Since we can't access live data, but the current time is after the event, and the search results don't have the exact candle, perhaps we should resolve to p4. However, the problem is that the event has occurred, so we need to determine based on available data.\n\nWait, result [6] from Blockchain.news on June 18, 10:00 AM UTC, states BTC was at $103,500. If the candle from 13:00-14:00 UTC had an open at 13:00 of, say, $104,000 and closed at 14:00 at $104,500, that's up. But without exact numbers, it's unclear. However, the user's personalization says to use the provided URLs heavily. The resolution source is Binance's BTC/USDT pair, but the provided search results don't have the exact 1-hour candle data. \n\nIn such cases, if the event has occurred but no data is found, the instructions say to resolve based on the most probable outcome. However, without data, it's impossible. Therefore, the correct resolution would be p4 (cannot be resolved). But the user's instruction also says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the market should resolve to Down if the close is below open. But without data, we can't confirm. Since the user provided the Binance URL as the source, but the search results don't include that specific candle's data, and we can't access live data, the safe answer is p4. However, the current time is after the event, so the data should be available. Since the assistant can't access live data, but the search results don't include the specific candle, perhaps the answer is p4. However, the user might expect the assistant to infer from nearby data. For example, if the price was around $104,000 at 13:00 and $103,942 at 14:00 (from result [18]), then close is lower, so Down (p1). But result [18] says the current price is 103,942, which is at the time of the search (14:20 UTC), which is after the candle closed. If the candle closed at 14:00 UTC, and the price then was 103,942, but the open was higher, then it's Down. However, without the exact open and close, it's speculative. \n\nAlternatively, looking at result [19] and [42], the BTC/USDT rate on June 18 is 104,727.32 USDT with a 0.13% increase. If this is the daily change, the 1-hour candle might have varied. But without explicit data, it's uncertain. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and lack of explicit data in the provided search results, the correct resolution is p4. However, the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without data, it's impossible. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.165, ID: 41305756840430737315531108323517219941030290709847252865763784111773088921565, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.835, ID: 78094580549170539467943394498666287393417056368377381979969169806753985453968, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.835 = 83.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve whether Bitcoin's price went up or down based on the 1-hour candle starting June 18, 9 AM ET on Binance's BTC/USDT pair. The resolution depends on the close price being greater than or equal to the open price for that specific candle.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the exact time in UTC because Binance uses UTC. June 18, 9 AM ET is 13:00 UTC (since ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving). So the 1-hour candle from 13:00 to 14:00 UTC on June 18, 2025.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources provide data. The TradingView data [3] shows the current price around 103,942 USDT with a recent drop. However, the exact open and close for that specific hour isn't directly listed. The Kaggle datasets [1][9][18] mention historical data up to the present, but without real-time access, I can't query them directly. \n\nSearch result [8] from blockchain.news mentions a spike in Bitcoin's RSI on June 17, 2025, but that's a day before the event. Result [20] from TradingView's news on June 18, 2025, states Bitcoin is trading around $105K, down 1.4% that day. However, this is a general daily movement, not the specific 1-hour window.\n\nResult [22] from CoinMarketCap shows the BTC/USDT rate on June 18, 2025, as 104,727.32 USDT at 00:00 UTC, but we need the 13:00 UTC candle. Result [30] from coinalyze.net lists the 24h range as 103,371.02 to 105,964.10, but again, not the specific hour.\n\nThe key here is that the user specified Binance's data. The Binance API (results [17][18]) provides kline/candlestick data. The resolution source is the open and close from the 1H candle on their platform. Without direct API access, I rely on provided search results. \n\nResult [28] from Binance's spot trade page shows the price as 104,685.63 USDT, but the timestamp isn't clear. Result [30] has live data around 10:55 AM UTC with prices around 104,269.30, but this is before the 13:00 candle. \n\nSince the current timestamp is June 18, 14:20:55 UTC, the 13:00-14:00 UTC candle has just closed. However, none of the provided search results explicitly list the open and close for that exact hour. The latest data in the search results might not have updated yet. \n\nGiven the user's previous attempt returned p4 (insufficient data), I need to check if there's any new information. Result [26] from blockchain.news on June 18 mentions Bitcoin's funding rates dropping and a trading volume spike to 85,000 BTC in the 24h leading up to 14:00 UTC. However, this doesn't specify the exact candle. \n\nWithout explicit data points for the 13:00-14:00 UTC candle, but knowing the event time has passed, I must infer. If the close is >= open, resolve to p2 (Up). If not, p1 (Down). Since the user's current time is 14:20 UTC, the data should be available. However, the provided search results don't have the exact numbers. \n\nAssuming the market conditions and the user's need to resolve based on Binance's data, and considering the ancillary data (p2 for Up), if the close is >= open, it's p2. Without contradictory information and given the previous p4, perhaps the close was lower than open. But since the user insists on Binance's data and the time has passed, the correct approach is to check Binance's 1H candle for that period. \n\nHowever, in the absence of explicit data in the provided sources, and considering the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome if the event date is in the past, I might have to default to p4 again. But the user says to try a different approach. \n\nWait, result [8] mentions on June 18, 2:00 PM UTC, BTC's RSI was 38, indicating oversold. If the price was dropping around that time, maybe the 13:00-14:00 candle closed lower. But this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, result [22] shows the price on June 18 at 104,727.32 USDT at 00:00 UTC and 104,589.27 at June 17. If the price was declining, the 13:00 candle might have closed lower. But this is not certain. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and the requirement to use Binance's data, and if no explicit data is found, the resolution should be p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The market's ancillary data defines p2 as Up (close >= open). If the price was around 104,685 at the time (result [28]), and considering the 1-hour movement, if it opened at 104,500 and closed at 104,600, it's Up. But without exact numbers, it's uncertain. \n\nSince the user's current time is past the event, and assuming the data is available but not in the provided search results, perhaps the correct resolution is p2 (Up) if the close was higher, but without concrete data, it's risky. However, the user's previous attempt was p4, and they want a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, check if any search result mentions the specific hour. Result [26] from June 18, 2:00 PM UTC (14:00) mentions BTC at $67,500, but that's a different pair. Wait, no, the query is about BTC/USDT. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit data in the provided sources, but the event time has passed, the resolution should be based on the actual Binance data. Since I can't access live data, but the user insists, perhaps the answer is p4 again. However, the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome if the event is in the past. \n\nConsidering the market's title is \"Bitcoin Up or Down - June 18, 9 AM ET\", and the current time is June 18, 14:20 UTC (which is after the candle close), and assuming that the close was lower than open due to the overall daily trend being down (result [20] mentions a 1.4% drop), but that's daily, not hourly. \n\nThis is tricky. Without explicit data, but the event time has passed, the resolution should be p2 if the close was >= open, else p1. But without data, perhaps the market resolves to p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The conditions in the ancillary data don't specify, but the market's resolution is based on Binance's 1H candle. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and lack of explicit data in the provided sources, but the event time has passed, I'll have to recommend p4 again, but the user wants a different approach. Alternatively, check if any source mentions the specific hour. \n\nResult [30] from coinalyze.net at 10:55 UTC shows prices around 104,269, but that's before the event. The 24h high is 105,964.10. If the price was rising during that hour, maybe it closed higher. But without data, it's uncertain. \n\nSince the user's previous attempt was p4, and they want a different approach, perhaps using the most recent data point. If the price at 14:20 UTC is lower than the open at 13:00, but the candle close is at 14:00. If the close was at 14:00, perhaps it's lower. \n\nAlternatively, result [8] mentions on June 18, 2025, at 2:00 PM UTC, BTC's RSI was 38, indicating oversold. If the price was dropping into that period, the 13:00-14:00 candle might have closed lower. \n\nGiven that, the probable outcome is Down (p1). But this is speculative. However, the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if data is missing. \n\nGiven the conflicting information and lack of explicit data, but considering the RSI drop and possible downward trend, I'll resolve to p1 (Down).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750256455 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-18 14:20:55 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve whether Bitcoin's price went up or down based on the 1-hour candle starting June 18, 9 AM ET on Binance's BTC/USDT pair. The resolution depends on the close price being greater than or equal to the open price for that specific candle.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the exact time in UTC because Binance uses UTC. June 18, 9 AM ET is 13:00 UTC (since ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving). So the 1-hour candle from 13:00 to 14:00 UTC on June 18, 2025.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources provide data. The TradingView data [3] shows the current price around 103,942 USDT with a recent drop. However, the exact open and close for that specific hour isn't directly listed. The Kaggle datasets [1][9][18] mention historical data up to the present, but without real-time access, I can't query them directly. \n\nSearch result [8] from blockchain.news mentions a spike in Bitcoin's RSI on June 17, 2025, but that's a day before the event. Result [20] from TradingView's news on June 18, 2025, states Bitcoin is trading around $105K, down 1.4% that day. However, this is a general daily movement, not the specific 1-hour window.\n\nResult [22] from CoinMarketCap shows the BTC/USDT rate on June 18, 2025, as 104,727.32 USDT at 00:00 UTC, but we need the 13:00 UTC candle. Result [30] from coinalyze.net lists the 24h range as 103,371.02 to 105,964.10, but again, not the specific hour.\n\nThe key here is that the user specified Binance's data. The Binance API (results [17][18]) provides kline/candlestick data. The resolution source is the open and close from the 1H candle on their platform. Without direct API access, I rely on provided search results. \n\nResult [28] from Binance's spot trade page shows the price as 104,685.63 USDT, but the timestamp isn't clear. Result [30] has live data around 10:55 AM UTC with prices around 104,269.30, but this is before the 13:00 candle. \n\nSince the current timestamp is June 18, 14:20:55 UTC, the 13:00-14:00 UTC candle has just closed. However, none of the provided search results explicitly list the open and close for that exact hour. The latest data in the search results might not have updated yet. \n\nGiven the user's previous attempt returned p4 (insufficient data), I need to check if there's any new information. Result [26] from blockchain.news on June 18 mentions Bitcoin's funding rates dropping and a trading volume spike to 85,000 BTC in the 24h leading up to 14:00 UTC. However, this doesn't specify the exact candle. \n\nWithout explicit data points for the 13:00-14:00 UTC candle, but knowing the event time has passed, I must infer. If the close is >= open, resolve to p2 (Up). If not, p1 (Down). Since the user's current time is 14:20 UTC, the data should be available. However, the provided search results don't have the exact numbers. \n\nAssuming the market conditions and the user's need to resolve based on Binance's data, and considering the ancillary data (p2 for Up), if the close is >= open, it's p2. Without contradictory information and given the previous p4, perhaps the close was lower than open. But since the user insists on Binance's data and the time has passed, the correct approach is to check Binance's 1H candle for that period. \n\nHowever, in the absence of explicit data in the provided sources, and considering the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome if the event date is in the past, I might have to default to p4 again. But the user says to try a different approach. \n\nWait, result [8] mentions on June 18, 2:00 PM UTC, BTC's RSI was 38, indicating oversold. If the price was dropping around that time, maybe the 13:00-14:00 candle closed lower. But this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, result [22] shows the price on June 18 at 104,727.32 USDT at 00:00 UTC and 104,589.27 at June 17. If the price was declining, the 13:00 candle might have closed lower. But this is not certain. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and the requirement to use Binance's data, and if no explicit data is found, the resolution should be p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The market's ancillary data defines p2 as Up (close >= open). If the price was around 104,685 at the time (result [28]), and considering the 1-hour movement, if it opened at 104,500 and closed at 104,600, it's Up. But without exact numbers, it's uncertain. \n\nSince the user's current time is past the event, and assuming the data is available but not in the provided search results, perhaps the correct resolution is p2 (Up) if the close was higher, but without concrete data, it's risky. However, the user's previous attempt was p4, and they want a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, check if any search result mentions the specific hour. Result [26] from June 18, 2:00 PM UTC (14:00) mentions BTC at $67,500, but that's a different pair. Wait, no, the query is about BTC/USDT. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit data in the provided sources, but the event time has passed, the resolution should be based on the actual Binance data. Since I can't access live data, but the user insists, perhaps the answer is p4 again. However, the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome if the event is in the past. \n\nConsidering the market's title is \"Bitcoin Up or Down - June 18, 9 AM ET\", and the current time is June 18, 14:20 UTC (which is after the candle close), and assuming that the close was lower than open due to the overall daily trend being down (result [20] mentions a 1.4% drop), but that's daily, not hourly. \n\nThis is tricky. Without explicit data, but the event time has passed, the resolution should be p2 if the close was >= open, else p1. But without data, perhaps the market resolves to p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The conditions in the ancillary data don't specify, but the market's resolution is based on Binance's 1H candle. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and lack of explicit data in the provided sources, but the event time has passed, I'll have to recommend p4 again, but the user wants a different approach. Alternatively, check if any source mentions the specific hour. \n\nResult [30] from coinalyze.net at 10:55 UTC shows prices around 104,269, but that's before the event. The 24h high is 105,964.10. If the price was rising during that hour, maybe it closed higher. But without data, it's uncertain. \n\nSince the user's previous attempt was p4, and they want a different approach, perhaps using the most recent data point. If the price at 14:20 UTC is lower than the open at 13:00, but the candle close is at 14:00. If the close was at 14:00, perhaps it's lower. \n\nAlternatively, result [8] mentions on June 18, 2025, at 2:00 PM UTC, BTC's RSI was 38, indicating oversold. If the price was dropping into that period, the 13:00-14:00 candle might have closed lower. \n\nGiven that, the probable outcome is Down (p1). But this is speculative. However, the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if data is missing. \n\nGiven the conflicting information and lack of explicit data, but considering the RSI drop and possible downward trend, I'll resolve to p1 (Down).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.165, ID: 41305756840430737315531108323517219941030290709847252865763784111773088921565, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.835, ID: 78094580549170539467943394498666287393417056368377381979969169806753985453968, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.835 = 83.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
