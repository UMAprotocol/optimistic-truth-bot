      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the outcome of the Alex De Minaur vs. Jiri Lehecka match at the HSBC Championships on June 17, 2025. The current date is June 17, 2025, so the event is happening today. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the match has already occurred. The search results mention the match is scheduled for June 17 at 11:00 UTC. Since the current timestamp is 12:26:38 UTC on the same day, the match might be ongoing or about to start. However, some sources like [1], [3], [13], [20], [27], [33], [42], [51], [57], [66] provide live score links, but the actual content doesn't show the result yet. \n\nNext, I should verify if there's any reported outcome. The search results don't mention the result of the match; they mostly provide previews, predictions, and player stats. For example, sources [4], [6], [15], [19], [25], [28], [37], [41], [54], [60], [68] predict De Minaur as the likely winner based on their head-to-head record and grass court performance. However, predictions aren't actual results.\n\nThe user's personalization instructions state that if the event is scheduled for the same day but a later time, it's still considered a future event, and the recommendation should be p4. However, the current time is 12:26 PM UTC, and the match is at 11:00 AM UTC. Wait, that's conflicting. If the match was at 11:00 UTC and it's now 12:26 UTC, the match should have already started or concluded. But the search results don't provide the result, so it's possible the match is ongoing or the result hasn't been reported yet.\n\nSince the user provided a URL (https://www.lta.org.uk/fan-zone/international/hsbc-championships/), I should check that source. However, the provided search results include [5], [14], [18], which are from the LTA site. [14] mentions results from day one, but the De Minaur vs. Lehecka match is on day two (June 17). The latest update in [14] is about day one matches, so the result isn't there yet.\n\nGiven that the current time is past the match's scheduled start but no result is available in the provided sources, and the user's instruction to default to p4 if the event is in the future or unresolved, but since the event date is today and the time has passed, but no result is found, the correct recommendation would be p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. But here, the event is today, and the time is after the scheduled start. Since the result isn't available in the sources, and the user's instructions say if it's the same day but later time, it's still future. Wait, the match was at 11:00 UTC, current time is 12:26 UTC, so it's in the past. But without result data, and the sources not reporting it, perhaps the match is ongoing or the result isn't out yet. According to the user's rules, if the event is in the past but no info, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data says p2 is De Minaur. Since all predictions favor De Minaur, and their H2H is 1-0, and grass record better, the recommendation would be p2. But wait, the user's instruction says if the event is in the past (date-wise) but no info, assume probable outcome. Since today is June 17, and the match was today, but the current time is after the match time, but no result is found, we have to check if it's considered past. The user's current timestamp is June 17, 12:26 PM UTC, and the match was at 11:00 AM UTC. So the match is in the past. If no result is found, we assume the most probable outcome, which is De Minaur (p2). However, the user's instruction also says if the event is scheduled for the same day but later time, it's future. But here, the match time is earlier than current time. So it's in the past. Therefore, since the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, and no verifiable outcome is found, we resolve based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions. Thus, recommend p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the outcome of the Alex De Minaur vs. Jiri Lehecka match at the HSBC Championships on June 17, 2025. The current date is June 17, 2025, so the event is happening today. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the match has already occurred. The search results mention the match is scheduled for June 17 at 11:00 UTC. Since the current timestamp is 12:26:38 UTC on the same day, the match might be ongoing or about to start. However, some sources like [1], [3], [13], [20], [27], [33], [42], [51], [57], [66] provide live score links, but the actual content doesn't show the result yet. \n\nNext, I should verify if there's any reported outcome. The search results don't mention the result of the match; they mostly provide previews, predictions, and player stats. For example, sources [4], [6], [15], [19], [25], [28], [37], [41], [54], [60], [68] predict De Minaur as the likely winner based on their head-to-head record and grass court performance. However, predictions aren't actual results.\n\nThe user's personalization instructions state that if the event is scheduled for the same day but a later time, it's still considered a future event, and the recommendation should be p4. However, the current time is 12:26 PM UTC, and the match is at 11:00 AM UTC. Wait, that's conflicting. If the match was at 11:00 UTC and it's now 12:26 UTC, the match should have already started or concluded. But the search results don't provide the result, so it's possible the match is ongoing or the result hasn't been reported yet.\n\nSince the user provided a URL (https://www.lta.org.uk/fan-zone/international/hsbc-championships/), I should check that source. However, the provided search results include [5], [14], [18], which are from the LTA site. [14] mentions results from day one, but the De Minaur vs. Lehecka match is on day two (June 17). The latest update in [14] is about day one matches, so the result isn't there yet.\n\nGiven that the current time is past the match's scheduled start but no result is available in the provided sources, and the user's instruction to default to p4 if the event is in the future or unresolved, but since the event date is today and the time has passed, but no result is found, the correct recommendation would be p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. But here, the event is today, and the time is after the scheduled start. Since the result isn't available in the sources, and the user's instructions say if it's the same day but later time, it's still future. Wait, the match was at 11:00 UTC, current time is 12:26 UTC, so it's in the past. But without result data, and the sources not reporting it, perhaps the match is ongoing or the result isn't out yet. According to the user's rules, if the event is in the past but no info, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data says p2 is De Minaur. Since all predictions favor De Minaur, and their H2H is 1-0, and grass record better, the recommendation would be p2. But wait, the user's instruction says if the event is in the past (date-wise) but no info, assume probable outcome. Since today is June 17, and the match was today, but the current time is after the match time, but no result is found, we have to check if it's considered past. The user's current timestamp is June 17, 12:26 PM UTC, and the match was at 11:00 AM UTC. So the match is in the past. If no result is found, we assume the most probable outcome, which is De Minaur (p2). However, the user's instruction also says if the event is scheduled for the same day but later time, it's future. But here, the match time is earlier than current time. So it's in the past. Therefore, since the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, and no verifiable outcome is found, we resolve based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions. Thus, recommend p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: De Minaur, Price: 0.0045, ID: 44554697026128717806568193268554267435619201593120193487347420799020633905932, Winner: No\n- Token: Lehecka, Price: 0.9955, ID: 34871233381110921425444832031642144634692010671862379524962689841508728374523, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Lehecka, p2 to De Minaur, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Lehecka, p2 = De Minaur\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Lehecka outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.996 = 99.6% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

However, the user's previous response was p2 (De Minaur wins), but they want a different approach or alternative data sources.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources (1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 19, 21, 29, 31, 34, 36, 44, 47, 60, 61, 67) mention the match is scheduled for June 17, 2025, at 11:00 UTC.

Their only previous meeting was at the 2023 Davis Cup, which De Minaur won in three sets. \n\nDe Minaur's grass court record is strong (32-17 with titles), while Lehecka's is 7-6 (sources 2, 4, 19, 29, 34, 44, 48, 61). Recent form: De Minaur had a solid clay season but lost early at the French Open. Lehecka reached the quarterfinals in Stuttgart but lost to Shelton (sources 2, 4, 19, 29, 34, 44, 61). \n\nPredictions from sports analysts (sources 2, 4, 15, 19, 29, 34, 35, 37, 44, 48, 61, 67) heavily favor De Minaur, citing his experience on grass and past performance. Some even predict a 2-1 scoreline. \n\nThe official HSBC Championships website (source 50) lists the schedule, with the match on June 17. However, there's no direct result in the search results. Since the current time is 12:26 PM UTC, the match (scheduled for 11:00 AM UTC) should have concluded. \n\nBut none of the provided search results give the actual result. The user's previous answer was p2 (De Minaur), but they want a recheck. Without explicit confirmation from official sources or live scores, the resolution might default to p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nGiven the overwhelming predictions and H2H, the most probable outcome is De Minaur (p2). However, the user's personalization says if the event is on the same day but later time, it's still future. Wait, the match was at 11:00 UTC, current time is 12:26 UTC. So it's past.

But the user says the previous response was p2 and wants a different approach. Maybe check if there's any conflicting info. All sources point to De Minaur as the favorite.

Where p1 corresponds to Lehecka, p2 to De Minaur, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Lehecka, p2 = De Minaur\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Lehecka outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.996 = 99.6% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the outcome of the Alex De Minaur vs Jiri Lehecka match at the HSBC Championships. The event date is June 17, 2025, which is in the past relative to the current timestamp of June 17, 2025, 12:26:38 UTC. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred and what the result was. The search results provided include multiple sources. Let's look through them. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources like [1], [12], [17], [36], [43], [53], [57] mention the preview and prediction for the match, but they don't report the actual result. However, some sources like [2], [16], [28], [35], [48], [49] provide updates from the HSBC Championships. \n\nIn [2], the results from day one mention Dan Evans and Jacob Fearnley winning their matches, and Cam Norrie losing. However, there's no mention of De Minaur vs Lehecka in the day one results. Similarly, [16] and [35] also discuss day one results without mentioning this specific match. \n\nWait, the match was scheduled for June 17, which is day two of the tournament. The current timestamp is June 17, 12:26 PM UTC. The match was supposed to start at 11:00 AM UTC according to [3], [13], [18], [31], [33], [41], [55], [58]. However, the search results don't include any live scores or post-match reports confirming the outcome. \n\nLooking at [24], which is a live score update from Sky Sports, it shows that Alex De Minaur is currently playing Jiri Lehecka with a score of 2-4 in the first set. This suggests the match is ongoing as of the current timestamp. Since the event is happening on the same day but the current time is 12:26 PM, and the match started at 11:00 AM, it's possible the match is still in progress. \n\nHowever, the user's previous response recommended p2 (De Minaur), but they asked to try again. The ancillary data specifies that if the event is scheduled for the same day but hasn't concluded yet, it's considered a future event, and the resolution should be p4. But the current timestamp is June 17, 12:26 PM, and the match started at 11:00 AM. If the match hasn't concluded by the current time, it's still ongoing, hence unresolved. \n\nBut according to the personalization instructions, if the event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (even if it's the same day but earlier time), it's still considered future. Wait, the current time is 12:26 PM, and the match started at 11:00 AM. If the match is ongoing, it's not yet resolved. However, the user's previous response might have been based on incomplete data. \n\nWait, the Sky Sports live score in [24] and [56] shows the match as ongoing with De Minaur trailing 2-4. Since the match is in progress and hasn't concluded, and the current timestamp is after the start time but before the match's completion, the event hasn't been finalized. Therefore, according to the instructions, if the event hasn't occurred yet or is ongoing, it's considered unresolved, and the recommendation should be p4 (unknown/50-50). \n\nHowever, the user's personalization says that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome exists, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions unless contradicted. But in this case, the event is on the same day, and the match is ongoing. Therefore, it's still a future event relative to the current timestamp, so p4 applies. \n\nBut wait, the current timestamp is June 17, 12:26 PM UTC, and the match started at 11:00 AM. Depending on how long the match takes, it might have already finished. However, the search results don't include any post-match reports. The latest info is the live score showing it's in progress. Without confirmation of the result, we can't resolve it. \n\nTherefore, the correct recommendation is p4 because the event is ongoing, and the outcome isn't verified yet. However, the user's previous response was p2, and they want a different approach. Maybe the initial response didn't check the live scores. \n\nRe-evaluating, since the match is on the same day and the current time is after the start time but before the end, and there's no confirmed result, the resolution should be p4. However, if the match was scheduled for 7:00 AM ET (which is 11:00 AM UTC), and the current time is 12:26 PM UTC, the match might have concluded. But without any sources confirming the result, we can't assume. \n\nThe instructions say if the event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time, it's still future. Here, the match started at 11:00 AM UTC, and the current time is 12:26 PM UTC. If the match typically lasts around 2 hours, it might still be ongoing. Without confirmation, we can't resolve. Hence, p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Where p1 corresponds to Lehecka, p2 to De Minaur, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750163198 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-17 12:26:38 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p2. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p2.

Where p1 corresponds to Lehecka, p2 to De Minaur, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality.

Recommendation found: p4.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p4\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: De Minaur, Price: 0.0045, ID: 44554697026128717806568193268554267435619201593120193487347420799020633905932, Winner: No\n- Token: Lehecka, Price: 0.9955, ID: 34871233381110921425444832031642144634692010671862379524962689841508728374523, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Lehecka, p2 to De Minaur, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Lehecka, p2 = De Minaur\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Lehecka outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.996 = 99.6% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: HSBC Championships: De Minaur vs. Lehecka, description: Alex De Minaur and Jiri Lehecka are scheduled to play each other in a Round 1 matchup in the HSBC Championships mens singles tournament on June 17, 2025, at 7:00 AM ET. \n\nThis market will resolve to \"De Minaur\" if Alex De Minaur advances against Jiri Lehecka in Round 1 of the HSBC Championships mens singles tournament.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Lehecka\" if Jiri Lehecka advances against Alex Di Minaur in Round 1 of the HSBC Championships mens singles tournament.\n\nIf the match ends in a tie, is canceled, or delayed beyond June 24, 2025, this market will resolve to 50-50.\n\nThe primary resolution source will be official information from the HSBC Championships (https://www.lta.org.uk/fan-zone/international/hsbc-championships/), however, a consensus of credible reporting may also be used. market_id: 552982\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Lehecka, p2 to De Minaur, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750163198 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-17 12:26:38 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\n# Load environment variables\nload_dotenv()\nAPI_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\nif not API_KEY:\n    raise ValueError(\"Missing SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\n\n# Configuration for headers and endpoints\nHEADERS = {\"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key\": API_KEY}\nPRIMARY_ENDPOINT = \"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json/GamesByDate/\"\nPROXY_ENDPOINT = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy/mlb/scores/json/GamesByDate/\"\n\n# Date and teams for the match\nMATCH_DATE = \"2025-06-17\"\nTEAM1 = \"De Minaur\"\nTEAM2 = \"Lehecka\"\n\n# Function to make API requests\ndef make_request(date):\n    url = f\"{PRIMARY_ENDPOINT}{date}\"\n    proxy_url = f\"{PROXY_ENDPOINT}{date}\"\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(proxy_url, headers=HEADERS, timeout=10)\n        if not response.ok:\n            response = requests.get(url, headers=HEADERS, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        return response.json()\n    except requests.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error fetching data: {e}\")\n        return None\n\n# Function to determine the outcome of the match\ndef determine_outcome(games, team1, team2):\n    for game in games:\n        if team1 in game['HomeTeamName'] and team2 in game['AwayTeamName']:\n            if game['Status'] == \"Final\":\n                if game['HomeTeamRuns'] > game['AwayTeamRuns']:\n                    return \"p2\"  # De Minaur wins\n                else:\n                    return \"p1\"  # Lehecka wins\n            elif game['Status'] in [\"Canceled\", \"Postponed\"]:\n                return \"p3\"  # 50-50\n    return \"p4\"  # Too early or no data\n\n# Main function to run the program\ndef main():\n    games = make_request(MATCH_DATE)\n    if games:\n        result = determine_outcome(games, TEAM1, TEAM2)\n        print(f\"recommendation: {result}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"recommendation: p4\")  # No data available\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nError fetching data: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json/GamesByDate/2025-06-17\nrecommendation: p4\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Where p1 corresponds to Lehecka, p2 to De Minaur, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Lehecka, p2 = De Minaur\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Lehecka outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.996 = 99.6% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Where p1 corresponds to Lehecka, p2 to De Minaur, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750163198 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-17 12:26:38 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4.

Where p1 corresponds to Lehecka, p2 to De Minaur, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Lehecka, p2 = De Minaur\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Lehecka outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.996 = 99.6% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

However, the market data strongly favors Jiri Lehecka with a confidence of 99.6%, which would correspond to a p1 outcome according to the resolution conditions. The solver's recommendation of p4 does not align with this strong market sentiment, indicating a potential oversight in considering market data in the decision-making process.

The API used is for MLB (Major League Baseball) data, which is unrelated to a tennis match. This fundamental error in data source selection invalidates the response. Additionally, the code faced an authorization error, which prevented any data retrieval, leading to a default recommendation of p4. The logic for determining the outcome based on the API data (if it had been correct) seems appropriate, but the mismatch in the sport and the API's focus area is a critical flaw. Furthermore, the market strongly favors Lehecka with a confidence of 99.55%, which contradicts the neutral stance of p4 suggested by the solver.",
