      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Canada will lower tariffs on the U.S. before June, specifically by May 31, 2025. The resolution depends on an official announcement from the Canadian government or credible reports confirming such action.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nSearch result [1] from May 14, 2025, mentions Canada suspending almost all retaliatory tariffs, bringing them to \"nearly zero\" due to exemptions. That's a strong indicator. The source is TT News, which seems credible.\n\nResult [2] from May 19, 2025, states that Canada paused some tariffs but the Finance Minister denied a full withdrawal. However, Oxford Economics reported the effective rate dropped to nearly zero. The government's official newspaper, Canada Gazette, outlined these pauses. This seems like an official action, even if not a full withdrawal.\n\nResult [3] from Wikipedia details the trade war timeline. On April 15, Canada announced a 6-month pause on certain tariffs, which would include dates up to October 2025. This pause started before May 31, so it counts.\n\nResult [4] from White & Case mentions a 30-day pause in February 2025, but that's outside the current timeframe. However, later updates in the same source might be relevant. Wait, the user's current date is June 9, 2025, so the 30-day pause in February is expired, but other pauses might be in effect.\n\nResult [16] and [17] from May 19, 2025, discuss Canada pausing some counter-tariffs, with the Finance Minister clarifying that not all were lifted. However, the exemptions covered many categories, effectively reducing tariffs to nearly zero. This aligns with the Oxford Economics report cited in [1] and [2].\n\nResult [18] from April 15, 2025, talks about a 6-month remission framework for certain imports, which would last until October 2025. This includes a temporary relief period starting before May 31.\n\nResult [19] from the Canadian government's site states that as of March 4, 2025, Canada imposed tariffs on $30 billion in U.S. goods but also introduced remission programs and exemptions, including the United States Surtax Remission Order effective until October 15, 2025. This remission order would qualify as a pause or delay.\n\nPutting this together, multiple sources indicate that Canada implemented tariff pauses, exemptions, and remissions specifically targeting U.S. goods before May 31. These actions were officially announced through the Canada Gazette and government news releases. The Oxford Economics report in [1] and [2] confirms the effective tariff rate dropped to nearly zero due to these measures. Even though the Finance Minister denied a full withdrawal, the specific exemptions and pauses qualify under the resolution conditions as lowering or pausing tariffs. Therefore, the answer should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749508287 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-09 22:31:27 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Canada will lower tariffs on the U.S. before June, specifically by May 31, 2025. The resolution depends on an official announcement from the Canadian government or credible reports confirming such action.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nSearch result [1] from May 14, 2025, mentions Canada suspending almost all retaliatory tariffs, bringing them to \"nearly zero\" due to exemptions. That's a strong indicator. The source is TT News, which seems credible.\n\nResult [2] from May 19, 2025, states that Canada paused some tariffs but the Finance Minister denied a full withdrawal. However, Oxford Economics reported the effective rate dropped to nearly zero. The government's official newspaper, Canada Gazette, outlined these pauses. This seems like an official action, even if not a full withdrawal.\n\nResult [3] from Wikipedia details the trade war timeline. On April 15, Canada announced a 6-month pause on certain tariffs, which would include dates up to October 2025. This pause started before May 31, so it counts.\n\nResult [4] from White & Case mentions a 30-day pause in February 2025, but that's outside the current timeframe. However, later updates in the same source might be relevant. Wait, the user's current date is June 9, 2025, so the 30-day pause in February is expired, but other pauses might be in effect.\n\nResult [16] and [17] from May 19, 2025, discuss Canada pausing some counter-tariffs, with the Finance Minister clarifying that not all were lifted. However, the exemptions covered many categories, effectively reducing tariffs to nearly zero. This aligns with the Oxford Economics report cited in [1] and [2].\n\nResult [18] from April 15, 2025, talks about a 6-month remission framework for certain imports, which would last until October 2025. This includes a temporary relief period starting before May 31.\n\nResult [19] from the Canadian government's site states that as of March 4, 2025, Canada imposed tariffs on $30 billion in U.S. goods but also introduced remission programs and exemptions, including the United States Surtax Remission Order effective until October 15, 2025. This remission order would qualify as a pause or delay.\n\nPutting this together, multiple sources indicate that Canada implemented tariff pauses, exemptions, and remissions specifically targeting U.S. goods before May 31. These actions were officially announced through the Canada Gazette and government news releases. The Oxford Economics report in [1] and [2] confirms the effective tariff rate dropped to nearly zero due to these measures. Even though the Finance Minister denied a full withdrawal, the specific exemptions and pauses qualify under the resolution conditions as lowering or pausing tariffs. Therefore, the answer should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0, ID: 51065013172903185313154520315481946829928603267851911968143517147736841371415, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 1, ID: 7967119239712495589557834061204469655077859043505735342516168778274925456806, Winner: Yes\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

The market resolves to \"Yes\" if there's an official announcement by May 31, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. Let's go through each one to find any announcements from the Canadian government about lowering, pausing, delaying, or removing tariffs on the U.S. by the deadline.\n\nLooking at result [1], it mentions that on April 15, Canada announced measures like a 6-month pause on tariffs for certain imports used in manufacturing and public services. That's a pause on existing tariffs, which fits the user's criteria. Also, automakers were exempted if they continued manufacturing in Canada. This seems like a tariff exemption, which qualifies as an item-specific exemption.\n\nResult [2] from May 12, 2025, states that Canada is imposing 25% tariffs on US goods. But this is about imposing, not lowering. However, result [11] from April 15, 2025, talks about remission frameworks and temporary relief for manufacturers, which includes pausing tariffs on certain goods. This is a direct action by the Canadian government to pause tariffs, which should count.\n\nResult [13] from April 17, 2025, mentions Canada allowing duty-free imports for automakers under specific conditions. This is an item-specific exemption, so it qualifies. \n\nResult [14] from May 1, 2025, confirms that Canada introduced a six-month remission on counter-tariffs for U.S. goods used in manufacturing, effective April 15. This is a temporary relief measure, which is a pause on tariffs for certain items.\n\nResult [15] from March 7, 2025, notes that Canada suspended the second wave of tariffs worth $125 billion until April 2 following a U.S. postponement. Although this is a delay, it's within the timeframe specified (before May 31). \n\nResult [16] from March 6, 2025, states that Ottawa paused its second phase of retaliatory tariffs in response to the U.S. delay. This is another delay action taken by Canada before the deadline.\n\nPutting this all together, there are multiple instances where Canada has officially announced pauses, delays, or exemptions on tariffs targeting the U.S. before May 31, 2025. These actions meet the resolution conditions as they are specific to U.S. goods and are official government announcements. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749508287 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-09 22:31:27 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p2. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p2.

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
