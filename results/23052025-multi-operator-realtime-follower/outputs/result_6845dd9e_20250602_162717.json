      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Cameron Norrie will reach the quarterfinals of the 2025 French Open Men's Singles tournament. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if he makes it, \"No\" (p1) if he doesn't. If he's already eliminated, it resolves immediately to No. The main source is the official Roland Garros site, but credible reports can be used too.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current status of Norrie in the tournament. The current date is June 2, 2025. Looking at the search results, there's a match scheduled for June 2 between Norrie and Djokovic in the fourth round [2][4][12]. The user's query is about reaching the quarterfinals, which is the next round after the fourth. So, if Norrie wins against Djokovic, he advances to the quarterfinals. If he loses, he's out, and the market resolves to No.\n\nNow, checking the latest results. The search results include a live update from the Telegraph [17] which shows the match in progress. The score is Norrie 2-6, 3-6, 1-3 Djokovic*. It looks like Djokovic is leading significantly. The article mentions Djokovic breaking Norrie's serve and being close to winning. If the match is ongoing, but based on the current score, Djokovic is likely to win. However, the user's current timestamp is June 2, 2025, 16:22:29 UTC. The match time is listed as 7:10 PM in Paris [2], which is UTC+2, so 17:10 UTC. The current timestamp is 16:22 UTC, so the match hasn't started yet. Wait, there's a discrepancy here. The live update from the Telegraph is dated June 2, but the match is scheduled for 7:10 PM Paris time (UTC+2), which would be 17:10 UTC. The current timestamp is 16:22 UTC, so the match hasn't started yet. Therefore, the live update might be a hypothetical or a preview. Wait, looking at the URL from the Telegraph [17], it's a live blog, but the content seems to describe the match as if it's happening. However, the current time is before the scheduled match time. This could be a simulated live blog or an error in the timestamp. Alternatively, the match might have started earlier. Need to verify.\n\nWait, the user's current timestamp is 2025-06-02 16:22:29 UTC. The match is scheduled for June 2, 7:10 PM in Paris, which is UTC+2, so 5:10 PM UTC. The current time is 4:22 PM UTC, so the match is scheduled to start in about 50 minutes. Therefore, the match hasn't occurred yet. The live blog from the Telegraph might be a preview or a placeholder. However, the search result [17] includes detailed game-by-game updates, which suggests that the match is in progress. This is conflicting. Let me check the dates again. The search result [17] is from June 2, 2025, and the live blog is about the Norrie vs. Djokovic match. If the current time is 4:22 PM UTC, and the match is at 5:10 PM UTC, then the live blog might be pre-match buildup. However, the detailed score suggests it's ongoing. This could be a mistake in the data or a time zone confusion. Alternatively, the match might have started earlier. Let me cross-reference other sources.\n\nLooking at search result [4], the preview article from Sportskeeda dated June 1 mentions the match is on June 2. Search result [12] from SportyTrader also mentions the match on June 2. The official Roland Garros schedule [2] lists the match on June 2. Therefore, the match is yet to occur as of the current timestamp. The live blog from the Telegraph might be a simulated or hypothetical live update, perhaps part of a preview. Therefore, the actual result of the match isn't available yet. Since the market resolves based on whether Norrie reaches the quarterfinals, and the match determining that is yet to happen, the resolution can't be determined yet. However, the user's personalization instructions state that if the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome. But the event date is June 2, which is the same as the current date. The event time is 7:10 PM Paris time (5:10 PM UTC), and the current time is 4:22 PM UTC. Therefore, the event is in the future. According to the personalization rules, if the event is scheduled for a future date or time, return p4. However, the user's instructions also say that if the event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time, it's still a future event. Therefore, the resolution should be p4 because the match hasn't occurred yet. However, the live blog from the Telegraph suggests the match is ongoing, which conflicts with the timestamp. This needs clarification.\n\nAlternatively, if the live blog is accurate and the match is in progress, but the current timestamp is before the scheduled time, there might be an error. Assuming the live blog is incorrect or a placeholder, the correct approach is to check the official Roland Garros website [2][3][7]. The official draws from Roland Garros [3][7] don't show the result of the Norrie vs. Djokovic match yet, as it's scheduled for June 2. Therefore, the match hasn't concluded, and the outcome is unknown. Thus, the market can't be resolved yet, leading to p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. But since the event is in the future, we must return p4. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

The user wants to know if Cameron Norrie will reach the quarterfinals of the 2025 French Open Men's Singles tournament. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if he makes it, \"No\" (p1) if he doesn't. If he's already eliminated, it resolves immediately to No. The main source is the official Roland Garros site, but credible reports can be used too.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current status of Norrie in the tournament. The current date is June 2, 2025. Looking at the search results, there's a match scheduled for June 2 between Norrie and Djokovic in the fourth round [2][4][12]. The user's query is about reaching the quarterfinals, which is the next round after the fourth. So, if Norrie wins against Djokovic, he advances to the quarterfinals. If he loses, he's out, and the market resolves to No.\n\nNow, checking the latest results. The search results include a live update from the Telegraph [17] which shows the match in progress. The score is Norrie 2-6, 3-6, 1-3 Djokovic*. It looks like Djokovic is leading significantly. The article mentions Djokovic breaking Norrie's serve and being close to winning. If the match is ongoing, but based on the current score, Djokovic is likely to win. However, the user's current timestamp is June 2, 2025, 16:22:29 UTC. The match time is listed as 7:10 PM in Paris [2], which is UTC+2, so 17:10 UTC. The current timestamp is 16:22 UTC, so the match hasn't started yet. Wait, there's a discrepancy here. The live update from the Telegraph is dated June 2, but the match is scheduled for 7:10 PM Paris time (UTC+2), which would be 17:10 UTC. The current timestamp is 16:22 UTC, so the match hasn't started yet. Therefore, the live update might be a hypothetical or a preview. Wait, looking at the URL from the Telegraph [17], it's a live blog, but the content seems to describe the match as if it's happening. However, the current time is before the scheduled match time. This could be a simulated live blog or an error in the timestamp. Alternatively, the match might have started earlier. Need to verify.\n\nWait, the user's current timestamp is 2025-06-02 16:22:29 UTC. The match is scheduled for June 2, 7:10 PM in Paris, which is UTC+2, so 5:10 PM UTC. The current time is 4:22 PM UTC, so the match is scheduled to start in about 50 minutes. Therefore, the match hasn't occurred yet. The live blog from the Telegraph might be a preview or a placeholder. However, the search result [17] includes detailed game-by-game updates, which suggests that the match is in progress. This is conflicting. Let me check the dates again. The search result [17] is from June 2, 2025, and the live blog is about the Norrie vs. Djokovic match. If the current time is 4:22 PM UTC, and the match is at 5:10 PM UTC, then the live blog might be pre-match buildup. However, the detailed score suggests it's ongoing. This could be a mistake in the data or a time zone confusion. Alternatively, the match might have started earlier. Let me cross-reference other sources.\n\nLooking at search result [4], the preview article from Sportskeeda dated June 1 mentions the match is on June 2. Search result [12] from SportyTrader also mentions the match on June 2. The official Roland Garros schedule [2] lists the match on June 2. Therefore, the match is yet to occur as of the current timestamp. The live blog from the Telegraph might be a simulated or hypothetical live update, perhaps part of a preview. Therefore, the actual result of the match isn't available yet. Since the market resolves based on whether Norrie reaches the quarterfinals, and the match determining that is yet to happen, the resolution can't be determined yet. However, the user's personalization instructions state that if the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome. But the event date is June 2, which is the same as the current date. The event time is 7:10 PM Paris time (5:10 PM UTC), and the current time is 4:22 PM UTC. Therefore, the event is in the future. According to the personalization rules, if the event is scheduled for a future date or time, return p4. However, the user's instructions also say that if the event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time, it's still a future event. Therefore, the resolution should be p4 because the match hasn't occurred yet. However, the live blog from the Telegraph suggests the match is ongoing, which conflicts with the timestamp. This needs clarification.\n\nAlternatively, if the live blog is accurate and the match is in progress, but the current timestamp is before the scheduled time, there might be an error. Assuming the live blog is incorrect or a placeholder, the correct approach is to check the official Roland Garros website [2][3][7]. The official draws from Roland Garros [3][7] don't show the result of the Norrie vs. Djokovic match yet, as it's scheduled for June 2. Therefore, the match hasn't concluded, and the outcome is unknown. Thus, the market can't be resolved yet, leading to p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. But since the event is in the future, we must return p4. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.0005, ID: 42138229328775919457442419376391001321098907092094593516515343396034654071146, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.9995, ID: 23031495056641132663437049844280302294511229376931198247406587964106367825987, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.
