The specific market is: \"Inter Miami vs. FC Porto: 3+ Goals Scored?\" which resolves to \"Yes\" if the combined goals exceed 2.5 (i.e., 3 or more goals) and \"No\" otherwise.\n\nThe resolution conditions are:\n- p1: No (0 goals or 1 or 2 goals)\n- p2: Yes (3 or more goals)\n- p3: Unknown/50-50 (0.5)\n\nWe are given the current timestamp: 1750364266 (2025-06-19 20:17:46 UTC). The match was scheduled for June 19, 2025, at 3:00 PM ET (which is 7:00 PM UTC). The current time is 8:17 PM UTC, which is after the match has concluded.\n\nWe have search results that provide information about the match. We must verify the outcome of the match and the number of goals scored.\n\nFrom the search results:\n\n[1] (FOX Sports) provides a box score for the match. It states: \"Omorodion (8') goal is the difference for Porto\" and the score is shown as MIA 0 - POR 1. This indicates only one goal was scored.\n\n[3] (ESPN UK) also shows the score as 0-1, with Samu Omorodion scoring a penalty in the 8th minute. The live score and stats confirm the final score was 0-1.\n\n[5] (ESPN IN) similarly shows the final score as 0-1.\n\n[9] (as.com) states: \"Goal! Inter Miami CF 0, FC Porto 1. Samu Aghehowa (FC Porto) converts the penalty with a right footed shot to the bottom left corner.\" This confirms only one goal.\n\n[12] (Goal.com) shows the final score as 0-1.\n\nAdditionally, [2] (beIN Sports) mentions the match and the context but does not report a different score. [4] (Sports Mole) is a preview and does not have the result. [6] (FIFA) does not have the specific match result. [7] (beIN Sports) is a live blog but we don't have the full content. [8] (FIFA) is the schedule. [10] (ESPN) does not show the result. [11] (FIFA) is in French and not about the match. [13] (YouTube) is a video titled \"Messi Hat-Trick\" but the description does not match the actual result (it seems to be a misleading title or from a different match). [14] (ESPN) is about team news before the match. [15] (joboneforhumanity) is a streaming page without the result.\n\nThe consistent result from multiple sources (FOX Sports, ESPN UK, ESPN IN, as.com, Goal.com) is that the match ended 0-1, meaning only one goal was scored.\n\nTherefore, the total goals scored in the match is 1, which is less than 2.5. The market should resolve to \"No\".\n\nAccording to the ancillary data:\n- p1 corresponds to \"No\"\n- p2 corresponds to \"Yes\"\n- p3 corresponds to unknown/50-50\n\nSince the outcome is clear and the total goals are 1 (which is less than 3), we resolve to p1.\n\nNote: The event has occurred (the match was played on June 19, 2025, and the current time is after the match). There is no indication of cancellation or postponement.\n\nThus, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\nBased on the verified match outcome from the FIFA Club World Cup Group A fixture between Inter Miami CF and FC Porto played on June 19, 2025, at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, the resolution for the market \"Inter Miami vs. FC Porto: 3+ Goals Scored?\" is determined as follows:\n\n### Match Outcome Analysis\n- The match concluded with a **1-0 victory for FC Porto**, with the sole goal scored by Samu Omorodion (Aghehowa) via an 8th-minute penalty[1][3][5][9].  \n- No additional goals were recorded during the match, as confirmed by live commentary, box scores, and post-match reports from multiple authoritative sources including ESPN, FOX Sports, and Goal.com[1][3][5][9][12].  \n\n### Market Resolution\n- The market condition required **3 or more total goals** (i.e., >2.5 goals) for resolution to \"Yes\" (p2).  \n- The actual goal tally was **1 goal**, falling below the threshold of 3 goals.  \n- The match was completed on schedule without cancellation or postponement[1][8].  \n\n### Recommendation\nThe market resolves to **\"No\"** (p1), as the combined goals (1) did not exceed 2.5.  \n\n`recommendation: p1`",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750364266 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-19 20:17:46 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nWe are resolving a UMA optimistic oracle request about the Inter Miami vs. FC Porto match in the FIFA Club World Cup on June 19, 2025. The specific market is: \"Inter Miami vs. FC Porto: 3+ Goals Scored?\" which resolves to \"Yes\" if the combined goals exceed 2.5 (i.e., 3 or more goals) and \"No\" otherwise.\n\nThe resolution conditions are:\n- p1: No (0 goals or 1 or 2 goals)\n- p2: Yes (3 or more goals)\n- p3: Unknown/50-50 (0.5)\n\nWe are given the current timestamp: 1750364266 (2025-06-19 20:17:46 UTC). The match was scheduled for June 19, 2025, at 3:00 PM ET (which is 7:00 PM UTC). The current time is 8:17 PM UTC, which is after the match has concluded.\n\nWe have search results that provide information about the match. We must verify the outcome of the match and the number of goals scored.\n\nFrom the search results:\n\n[1] (FOX Sports) provides a box score for the match. It states: \"Omorodion (8') goal is the difference for Porto\" and the score is shown as MIA 0 - POR 1. This indicates only one goal was scored.\n\n[3] (ESPN UK) also shows the score as 0-1, with Samu Omorodion scoring a penalty in the 8th minute. The live score and stats confirm the final score was 0-1.\n\n[5] (ESPN IN) similarly shows the final score as 0-1.\n\n[9] (as.com) states: \"Goal! Inter Miami CF 0, FC Porto 1. Samu Aghehowa (FC Porto) converts the penalty with a right footed shot to the bottom left corner.\" This confirms only one goal.\n\n[12] (Goal.com) shows the final score as 0-1.\n\nAdditionally, [2] (beIN Sports) mentions the match and the context but does not report a different score. [4] (Sports Mole) is a preview and does not have the result. [6] (FIFA) does not have the specific match result. [7] (beIN Sports) is a live blog but we don't have the full content. [8] (FIFA) is the schedule. [10] (ESPN) does not show the result. [11] (FIFA) is in French and not about the match. [13] (YouTube) is a video titled \"Messi Hat-Trick\" but the description does not match the actual result (it seems to be a misleading title or from a different match). [14] (ESPN) is about team news before the match. [15] (joboneforhumanity) is a streaming page without the result.\n\nThe consistent result from multiple sources (FOX Sports, ESPN UK, ESPN IN, as.com, Goal.com) is that the match ended 0-1, meaning only one goal was scored.\n\nTherefore, the total goals scored in the match is 1, which is less than 2.5. The market should resolve to \"No\".\n\nAccording to the ancillary data:\n- p1 corresponds to \"No\"\n- p2 corresponds to \"Yes\"\n- p3 corresponds to unknown/50-50\n\nSince the outcome is clear and the total goals are 1 (which is less than 3), we resolve to p1.\n\nNote: The event has occurred (the match was played on June 19, 2025, and the current time is after the match). There is no indication of cancellation or postponement.\n\nThus, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\nBased on the verified match outcome from the FIFA Club World Cup Group A fixture between Inter Miami CF and FC Porto played on June 19, 2025, at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, the resolution for the market \"Inter Miami vs. FC Porto: 3+ Goals Scored?\" is determined as follows:\n\n### Match Outcome Analysis\n- The match concluded with a **1-0 victory for FC Porto**, with the sole goal scored by Samu Omorodion (Aghehowa) via an 8th-minute penalty[1][3][5][9].  \n- No additional goals were recorded during the match, as confirmed by live commentary, box scores, and post-match reports from multiple authoritative sources including ESPN, FOX Sports, and Goal.com[1][3][5][9][12].  \n\n### Market Resolution\n- The market condition required **3 or more total goals** (i.e., >2.5 goals) for resolution to \"Yes\" (p2).  \n- The actual goal tally was **1 goal**, falling below the threshold of 3 goals.  \n- The match was completed on schedule without cancellation or postponement[1][8].  \n\n### Recommendation\nThe market resolves to **\"No\"** (p1), as the combined goals (1) did not exceed 2.5.  \n\n`recommendation: p1`\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.77, ID: 99923571499267025201224465047813074514433875993934902164291764696492674197412, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.23, ID: 49978561187203585968038534297735189619643240049781948759985092110101743738626, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors YES outcome (0.770 = 77.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
