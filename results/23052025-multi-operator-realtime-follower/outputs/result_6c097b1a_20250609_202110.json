      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump will issue a Gold Card before June, specifically by May 31, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if the first Gold Card is officially issued by that date. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The provided timestamp is June 9, 2025, so the deadline of May 31 has already passed. That means I need to determine if the Gold Card was issued by that date.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's a lot of information about the Gold Card proposal. The program was announced in February 2025, aiming to replace the EB-5 visa with a $5 million investment for residency and citizenship. Key sources mention the launch timeline. For example, result [41] from Boundless.com on May 27, 2025, states that Commerce Secretary Lutnick said the website (trumpcard.gov) would launch within a week. However, a website launch isn't the same as issuing the actual visa.\n\nResult [13] from donosolaw.com on May 28 mentions that the registration website (trumpcard.gov) was expected to launch that week or the next, but as of May 28, it wasn't live yet. This suggests that by May 31, the website might not have been operational, and no actual Gold Cards were issued yet.\n\nResult [64] from NDTV on March 24, 2025, claims that 1,000 Gold Cards were sold in a day, but this seems to be a claim by Commerce Secretary Lutnick, not an official issuance. However, this might be part of the registration or sales process, not the actual visa issuance.\n\nResult [78] from Wikipedia's Gold Card page mentions the proposal but doesn't confirm any actual issuances by May 31. Similarly, result [77] from CBS News on March 5, 2025, quotes Lutnick saying the Gold Cards would be available in about two weeks from March, but that would be mid-March, which is before the deadline. However, there's no confirmation in later sources that any were actually issued by May 31.\n\nResult [59] from Boundless.com on May 27, 2025, again mentions the website launch but no actual issuance. Result [55] from donosolaw.com on May 28 also discusses the upcoming website but no issuance. \n\nResult [78] from Wikipedia states that the Gold Card proposal was announced in February 2025, with an estimated launch by end of March, but no confirmation of actual issuance. \n\nConsidering all these, while there were announcements and preparations, there's no concrete evidence in the provided search results that the first Gold Card was officially issued by May 31, 2025. The closest is the claim of selling 1,000 cards in a day (result [64]), but without official confirmation of issuance, this might refer to registrations or applications, not the actual visa being granted. \n\nTherefore, based on the available information, the answer should be \"No\" (p1). However, there's some ambiguity because of the claim in result [64], but without official sources confirming issuance by the deadline, it's safer to resolve to \"No\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe query asks whether the first U.S. \"Gold Card\" visa was officially issued by May 31, 2025. Based on the provided search results and the current timestamp (June 9, 2025), there is no verifiable evidence that the Gold Card was formally issued by the deadline. While the Trump administration announced the program in February 2025 and outlined plans for a website (trumpcard.gov) to launch in late May 2025[13][41][59], the registration portal was not yet operational as of May 28, 2025[13][55]. Claims of 1,000 Gold Cards being \"sold\" in March 2025[64] refer to registrations or expressions of interest, not official issuances. No credible sources confirm that the first Gold Card was granted by May 31, 2025. Thus, the resolution is **p1 (No)**.",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749500359 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-09 20:19:19 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump will issue a Gold Card before June, specifically by May 31, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if the first Gold Card is officially issued by that date. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The provided timestamp is June 9, 2025, so the deadline of May 31 has already passed. That means I need to determine if the Gold Card was issued by that date.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's a lot of information about the Gold Card proposal. The program was announced in February 2025, aiming to replace the EB-5 visa with a $5 million investment for residency and citizenship. Key sources mention the launch timeline. For example, result [41] from Boundless.com on May 27, 2025, states that Commerce Secretary Lutnick said the website (trumpcard.gov) would launch within a week. However, a website launch isn't the same as issuing the actual visa.\n\nResult [13] from donosolaw.com on May 28 mentions that the registration website (trumpcard.gov) was expected to launch that week or the next, but as of May 28, it wasn't live yet. This suggests that by May 31, the website might not have been operational, and no actual Gold Cards were issued yet.\n\nResult [64] from NDTV on March 24, 2025, claims that 1,000 Gold Cards were sold in a day, but this seems to be a claim by Commerce Secretary Lutnick, not an official issuance. However, this might be part of the registration or sales process, not the actual visa issuance.\n\nResult [78] from Wikipedia's Gold Card page mentions the proposal but doesn't confirm any actual issuances by May 31. Similarly, result [77] from CBS News on March 5, 2025, quotes Lutnick saying the Gold Cards would be available in about two weeks from March, but that would be mid-March, which is before the deadline. However, there's no confirmation in later sources that any were actually issued by May 31.\n\nResult [59] from Boundless.com on May 27, 2025, again mentions the website launch but no actual issuance. Result [55] from donosolaw.com on May 28 also discusses the upcoming website but no issuance. \n\nResult [78] from Wikipedia states that the Gold Card proposal was announced in February 2025, with an estimated launch by end of March, but no confirmation of actual issuance. \n\nConsidering all these, while there were announcements and preparations, there's no concrete evidence in the provided search results that the first Gold Card was officially issued by May 31, 2025. The closest is the claim of selling 1,000 cards in a day (result [64]), but without official confirmation of issuance, this might refer to registrations or applications, not the actual visa being granted. \n\nTherefore, based on the available information, the answer should be \"No\" (p1). However, there's some ambiguity because of the claim in result [64], but without official sources confirming issuance by the deadline, it's safer to resolve to \"No\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe query asks whether the first U.S. \"Gold Card\" visa was officially issued by May 31, 2025. Based on the provided search results and the current timestamp (June 9, 2025), there is no verifiable evidence that the Gold Card was formally issued by the deadline. While the Trump administration announced the program in February 2025 and outlined plans for a website (trumpcard.gov) to launch in late May 2025[13][41][59], the registration portal was not yet operational as of May 28, 2025[13][55]. Claims of 1,000 Gold Cards being \"sold\" in March 2025[64] refer to registrations or expressions of interest, not official issuances. No credible sources confirm that the first Gold Card was granted by May 31, 2025. Thus, the resolution is **p1 (No)**.\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0, ID: 91966748574405051901054804874277927756110730266453914644241880849145334412028, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 1, ID: 15962653435802117358410782033696646037444965680880277364678736596382893635272, Winner: Yes\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
