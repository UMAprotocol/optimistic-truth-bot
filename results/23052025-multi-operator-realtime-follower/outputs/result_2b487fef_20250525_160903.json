      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump signed an executive order on May 24, 2025, based on the resolution conditions provided. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if the text of an executive order is published on the White House's presidential actions page or through the press pool by 12 PM ET the next day. Otherwise, it's \"No\".\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any executive orders signed on May 24. Looking at the sources:\n\n- Source [3] is a proclamation for Memorial Day 2025, dated May 24. It's listed under presidential actions on the White House site. Proclamations are a type of executive action, but the query specifies that executive actions don't count. Wait, the user said \"Executive actions will not qualify toward this market's resolution.\" So I need to confirm if a proclamation is considered an executive order or an executive action.\n\n- Source [4] mentions Trump signing executive orders on May 24 related to nuclear power. The article states he signed several executive orders on that date. The White House page (source [13]) also confirms the signing on May 23, but the CBS News article (source [4]) is dated May 24. There might be a discrepancy here. Wait, source [4] says \"2025-05-24\" and mentions Trump signing the orders on Friday, which would be May 24. The White House article (source [13]) is dated May 23, but that might be the publication date, while the signing happened on the 24th. Need to check the dates carefully.\n\n- Source [9] is a proclamation for National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, dated May 24. Again, this is a proclamation, not an executive order. The user specified that executive orders count, not other types of executive actions like proclamations.\n\n- Source [10] includes an executive order on May 23 (Executive Order 14167) but that's not on the 24th.\n\nWait, the key is to check if any executive orders were published on the White House page on May 24. Source [3] and [9] are proclamations, which are different from executive orders. Source [4] and [13] discuss executive orders signed on May 23 or 24. The CBS article (source [4]) is dated May 24 and says Trump signed the orders on Friday, which would be May 24. The White House article (source [13]) is dated May 23, but that might be a pre-release or the date of the announcement. However, the actual signing date is crucial. If the executive orders were signed on May 24 and published on the White House site that day, then the answer is \"Yes\".\n\nLooking at the White House's presidential actions page (as per the user's link), source [3] and [9] are proclamations from May 24. Source [4] and [13] refer to executive orders on nuclear energy. The Atlantic Council blog (source [11]) also mentions the executive orders signed on May 23. Wait, there's a conflict here. The CBS article says May 24, but the White House article says May 23. Need to resolve this discrepancy.\n\nWait, the user's current timestamp is May 25, 2025. The query is about May 24. The executive orders in source [4] are dated May 24, and the article says Trump signed them on Friday, which would be May 24. The White House article (source [13]) is dated May 23, but that might be when the announcement was made, not the signing date. However, the actual publication on the White House site would need to be checked. Since the user provided sources, and source [4] is a news article stating the signing on May 24, and the White House's own page (source [13]) mentions the signing on May 23, there's confusion. However, the CBS article is explicit: \"President Trump on Friday signed several executive orders...\" with the article dated May 24. So Friday, May 24, is the signing date. Therefore, if the White House published the text on May 24, then the answer is \"Yes\".\n\nAdditionally, the user's resolution condition requires the text to be published on the White House's presidential actions page. Source [13] is a White House article dated May 23, but it's an article, not the official presidential action page. The actual executive orders would be listed under the presidential actions section. The search results don't include a direct link to the executive orders from May 24, but source [4] and [11] confirm the signing on May 24. However, without a direct link from the White House's presidential actions page, it's uncertain. But given that the CBS article (source [4]) is a reputable source and the White House article (source [13]) mentions the signing, it's likely that the executive orders were published on the official page on May 24. Therefore, the resolution should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The user wants to know if Donald Trump signed an executive order on May 24, 2025, based on the resolution conditions provided. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if the text of an executive order is published on the White House's presidential actions page or through the press pool by 12 PM ET the next day. Otherwise, it's \"No\".\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any executive orders signed on May 24. Looking at the sources:\n\n- Source [3] is a proclamation for Memorial Day 2025, dated May 24. It's listed under presidential actions on the White House site. Proclamations are a type of executive action, but the query specifies that executive actions don't count. Wait, the user said \"Executive actions will not qualify toward this market's resolution.\" So I need to confirm if a proclamation is considered an executive order or an executive action.\n\n- Source [4] mentions Trump signing executive orders on May 24 related to nuclear power. The article states he signed several executive orders on that date. The White House page (source [13]) also confirms the signing on May 23, but the CBS News article (source [4]) is dated May 24. There might be a discrepancy here. Wait, source [4] says \"2025-05-24\" and mentions Trump signing the orders on Friday, which would be May 24. The White House article (source [13]) is dated May 23, but that might be the publication date, while the signing happened on the 24th. Need to check the dates carefully.\n\n- Source [9] is a proclamation for National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, dated May 24. Again, this is a proclamation, not an executive order. The user specified that executive orders count, not other types of executive actions like proclamations.\n\n- Source [10] includes an executive order on May 23 (Executive Order 14167) but that's not on the 24th.\n\nWait, the key is to check if any executive orders were published on the White House page on May 24. Source [3] and [9] are proclamations, which are different from executive orders. Source [4] and [13] discuss executive orders signed on May 23 or 24. The CBS article (source [4]) is dated May 24 and says Trump signed the orders on Friday, which would be May 24. The White House article (source [13]) is dated May 23, but that might be a pre-release or the date of the announcement. However, the actual signing date is crucial. If the executive orders were signed on May 24 and published on the White House site that day, then the answer is \"Yes\".\n\nLooking at the White House's presidential actions page (as per the user's link), source [3] and [9] are proclamations from May 24. Source [4] and [13] refer to executive orders on nuclear energy. The Atlantic Council blog (source [11]) also mentions the executive orders signed on May 23. Wait, there's a conflict here. The CBS article says May 24, but the White House article says May 23. Need to resolve this discrepancy.\n\nWait, the user's current timestamp is May 25, 2025. The query is about May 24. The executive orders in source [4] are dated May 24, and the article says Trump signed them on Friday, which would be May 24. The White House article (source [13]) is dated May 23, but that might be when the announcement was made, not the signing date. However, the actual publication on the White House site would need to be checked. Since the user provided sources, and source [4] is a news article stating the signing on May 24, and the White House's own page (source [13]) mentions the signing on May 23, there's confusion. However, the CBS article is explicit: \"President Trump on Friday signed several executive orders...\" with the article dated May 24. So Friday, May 24, is the signing date. Therefore, if the White House published the text on May 24, then the answer is \"Yes\".\n\nAdditionally, the user's resolution condition requires the text to be published on the White House's presidential actions page. Source [13] is a White House article dated May 23, but it's an article, not the official presidential action page. The actual executive orders would be listed under the presidential actions section. The search results don't include a direct link to the executive orders from May 24, but source [4] and [11] confirm the signing on May 24. However, without a direct link from the White House's presidential actions page, it's uncertain. But given that the CBS article (source [4]) is a reputable source and the White House article (source [13]) mentions the signing, it's likely that the executive orders were published on the official page on May 24. Therefore, the resolution should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.0015, ID: 4836366540801252857388706068619251317075407307619229715412960781858391514149, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.9985, ID: 115696168507435907414634242905068246415844006320639948099110096134420980916977, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.
