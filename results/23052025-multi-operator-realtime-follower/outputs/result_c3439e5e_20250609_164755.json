      "prompt": null,
      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump mentioned the word \"Apple\" between May 24, 12:00 PM ET and May 30, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The resolution depends on any verbal mention in a recorded and publicly accessible audio or video. Written statements or social media posts don't count. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any instances where Trump verbally said \"Apple\" during that timeframe. The key here is to look for events or speeches he made within those dates. \n\nLooking at the search results, there are several relevant entries. For example, on May 23, 2025, Trump threatened Apple with tariffs if they didn't manufacture iPhones in the US. However, that's before the start date of May 24. Then, on May 29 and 30, there are reports of Trump holding rallies in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, discussing the U.S. Steel deal. \n\nIn the video from the West Mifflin rally (search result 54), Trump's speech includes mentions of tariffs and possibly Apple. Specifically, in search result 48, Trump's speech at the U.S. Steel plant on May 30 includes discussions about tariffs, and he might have mentioned Apple in the context of manufacturing and tariffs. \n\nAnother key point is the May 30 rally where Trump announced doubling steel tariffs. If during that speech he referenced Apple, that would count. However, the transcripts provided don't explicitly show him saying \"Apple\" during the May 30 event. \n\nWait, search result 42 from CBS News on May 23 mentions Trump's threat to Apple, but that's before the timeframe. However, there's a video (search result 68) from May 1 where Cook praises Trump's policies, but that's outside the date range. \n\nLooking at search result 66 from May 29, Trump is quoted as saying, \"I had an understanding with Tim that he wouldn't be doing this. He said he's going to India to build plants. I said, 'That's okay, but you're not going to sell into here without tariffs.'\" This might be part of a speech within the date range. \n\nWait, the date on search result 66 is May 29, which is within the timeframe. If that was a verbal mention during a speech or event, then it would count. The article mentions Trump speaking in the White House Oval Office on May 29, referencing his discussion with Tim Cook about Apple building plants in India. If that was a recorded speech, then \"Apple\" was mentioned verbally. \n\nAdditionally, search result 62 from May 26 suggests that Trump's tariff announcement on May 23 was a reaction to Cook not attending an event, but the actual verbal mention might have occurred later. However, the key is whether there's a recorded instance within May 24 to May 30. \n\nThe rally in West Mifflin on May 30 (search result 48) is a likely candidate. The transcript in search result 21 mentions Trump speaking about the U.S. Steel deal and tariffs. If he mentioned Apple in that speech, that's within the timeframe. However, the provided transcript excerpts don't include the word \"Apple.\" \n\nWait, search result 16 from May 30 includes a quote from Trump: \"You have placed your trust in us and we will work hard in the years ahead to honor that trust.\" But that's from Takahiro Mori of Nippon Steel, not Trump. \n\nLooking at search result 49, the article from May 30 mentions Trump's speech at the Irvin Plant, but again, the provided text doesn't include him saying \"Apple.\" \n\nHmm, this is tricky. The user needs a verbal mention in a recorded video or audio between May 24 and May 30. The May 23 event is too early. The May 30 rally's transcript doesn't show \"Apple,\" but maybe in the full speech he mentioned it. \n\nWait, search result 54 is a live stream of Trump's rally on May 31, which is outside the timeframe. The user's end date is May 30. \n\nSearch result 53 is a video from May 31, which is also outside. \n\nLooking back, search result 66 from May 29 has Trump speaking in the Oval Office, which is within the timeframe. If that was a recorded statement where he said \"Apple,\" then it counts. The article quotes him saying, \"I had an understanding with Tim that he wouldn't be doing this. He said he's going to India to build plants. I said, 'That's okay, but you're not going to sell into here without tariffs.'\" If \"Tim\" refers to Tim Cook of Apple, then the context implies Apple, but he didn't explicitly say \"Apple.\" \n\nHowever, the query requires the exact term \"Apple\" to be mentioned. If Trump only referred to \"Tim\" without saying \"Apple,\" that might not count. \n\nAnother angle: search result 62 from May 26 mentions that Trump announced the 25% tariff on iPhones on May 23, but the article also states that during a trip to Qatar (dates?), Trump commented on Tim Cook's absence. If that trip was within the date range, and he mentioned Apple there, that would count. \n\nThe Qatar trip mentioned in search result 62 was from May 13-16, which is before the timeframe. \n\nSo, within the May 24-30 window, the key events are the May 29 Oval Office remarks and the May 30 rally. If in either of those, Trump verbally said \"Apple,\" then the answer is yes. \n\nThe May 29 article (search result 66) quotes Trump mentioning Tim Cook and Apple's plans, but it's unclear if he said \"Apple\" or just referred to Tim Cook. The exact quote in the article is: \"I had an understanding with Tim that he wouldn't be doing this. He said he's going to India to build plants. I said, 'That's okay, but you're not going to sell into here without tariffs.'\" If \"Tim\" is Tim Cook of Apple, but he didn't say \"Apple,\" then it doesn't count. \n\nHowever, in the same article, Trump's social media post on May 29 includes the word \"Apple,\" but that's written, not verbal. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided search results, there's no explicit verbal mention of \"Apple\" by Trump between May 24 and May 30. The threats on May 23 are outside the window, and the later events don't show him saying \"Apple\" verbally. \n\nThus, the resolution should be \"No\" (p1). However, I need to double-check if any of the rallies or speeches within the date range had him mentioning \"Apple.\" \n\nWait, search result 40 from May 24 describes an awkward moment where Trump's iPhone rang during a discussion. The article mentions Trump threatening Apple with tariffs, but that's a written post. The actual event where his phone rang was on May 24, and during that press interaction, did he mention \"Apple\"? The article states he was discussing tariffs on Apple, but if he said \"Apple\" during that press interaction, which was recorded, then it counts. \n\nThe article says: \"Trump has threatened to impose a 25% tariff on iPhones if they are not made in the United States, as he stepped up the pressure on Apple to build its signature product in the country.\" But this is a written statement. However, the article also describes a press event on May 24 where Trump's phone rang, and he joked about it. If during that press conference, he verbally mentioned \"Apple,\" that would count. \n\nThe article quotes Trump as saying: \"It would be also",

The user wants to know if Donald Trump mentioned the word \"Apple\" between May 24, 12:00 PM ET and May 30, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The resolution depends on any verbal mention in a recorded and publicly accessible audio or video. Written statements or social media posts don't count. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any instances where Trump verbally said \"Apple\" during that timeframe. The key here is to look for events or speeches he made within those dates. \n\nLooking at the search results, there are several relevant entries. For example, on May 23, 2025, Trump threatened Apple with tariffs if they didn't manufacture iPhones in the US. However, that's before the start date of May 24. Then, on May 29 and 30, there are reports of Trump holding rallies in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, discussing the U.S. Steel deal. \n\nIn the video from the West Mifflin rally (search result 54), Trump's speech includes mentions of tariffs and possibly Apple. Specifically, in search result 48, Trump's speech at the U.S. Steel plant on May 30 includes discussions about tariffs, and he might have mentioned Apple in the context of manufacturing and tariffs. \n\nAnother key point is the May 30 rally where Trump announced doubling steel tariffs. If during that speech he referenced Apple, that would count. However, the transcripts provided don't explicitly show him saying \"Apple\" during the May 30 event. \n\nWait, search result 42 from CBS News on May 23 mentions Trump's threat to Apple, but that's before the timeframe. However, there's a video (search result 68) from May 1 where Cook praises Trump's policies, but that's outside the date range. \n\nLooking at search result 66 from May 29, Trump is quoted as saying, \"I had an understanding with Tim that he wouldn't be doing this. He said he's going to India to build plants. I said, 'That's okay, but you're not going to sell into here without tariffs.'\" This might be part of a speech within the date range. \n\nWait, the date on search result 66 is May 29, which is within the timeframe. If that was a verbal mention during a speech or event, then it would count. The article mentions Trump speaking in the White House Oval Office on May 29, referencing his discussion with Tim Cook about Apple building plants in India. If that was a recorded speech, then \"Apple\" was mentioned verbally. \n\nAdditionally, search result 62 from May 26 suggests that Trump's tariff announcement on May 23 was a reaction to Cook not attending an event, but the actual verbal mention might have occurred later. However, the key is whether there's a recorded instance within May 24 to May 30. \n\nThe rally in West Mifflin on May 30 (search result 48) is a likely candidate. The transcript in search result 21 mentions Trump speaking about the U.S. Steel deal and tariffs. If he mentioned Apple in that speech, that's within the timeframe. However, the provided transcript excerpts don't include the word \"Apple.\" \n\nWait, search result 16 from May 30 includes a quote from Trump: \"You have placed your trust in us and we will work hard in the years ahead to honor that trust.\" But that's from Takahiro Mori of Nippon Steel, not Trump. \n\nLooking at search result 49, the article from May 30 mentions Trump's speech at the Irvin Plant, but again, the provided text doesn't include him saying \"Apple.\" \n\nHmm, this is tricky. The user needs a verbal mention in a recorded video or audio between May 24 and May 30. The May 23 event is too early. The May 30 rally's transcript doesn't show \"Apple,\" but maybe in the full speech he mentioned it. \n\nWait, search result 54 is a live stream of Trump's rally on May 31, which is outside the timeframe. The user's end date is May 30. \n\nSearch result 53 is a video from May 31, which is also outside. \n\nLooking back, search result 66 from May 29 has Trump speaking in the Oval Office, which is within the timeframe. If that was a recorded statement where he said \"Apple,\" then it counts. The article quotes him saying, \"I had an understanding with Tim that he wouldn't be doing this. He said he's going to India to build plants. I said, 'That's okay, but you're not going to sell into here without tariffs.'\" If \"Tim\" refers to Tim Cook of Apple, then the context implies Apple, but he didn't explicitly say \"Apple.\" \n\nHowever, the query requires the exact term \"Apple\" to be mentioned. If Trump only referred to \"Tim\" without saying \"Apple,\" that might not count. \n\nAnother angle: search result 62 from May 26 mentions that Trump announced the 25% tariff on iPhones on May 23, but the article also states that during a trip to Qatar (dates?), Trump commented on Tim Cook's absence. If that trip was within the date range, and he mentioned Apple there, that would count. \n\nThe Qatar trip mentioned in search result 62 was from May 13-16, which is before the timeframe. \n\nSo, within the May 24-30 window, the key events are the May 29 Oval Office remarks and the May 30 rally. If in either of those, Trump verbally said \"Apple,\" then the answer is yes. \n\nThe May 29 article (search result 66) quotes Trump mentioning Tim Cook and Apple's plans, but it's unclear if he said \"Apple\" or just referred to Tim Cook. The exact quote in the article is: \"I had an understanding with Tim that he wouldn't be doing this. He said he's going to India to build plants. I said, 'That's okay, but you're not going to sell into here without tariffs.'\" If \"Tim\" is Tim Cook of Apple, but he didn't say \"Apple,\" then it doesn't count. \n\nHowever, in the same article, Trump's social media post on May 29 includes the word \"Apple,\" but that's written, not verbal. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided search results, there's no explicit verbal mention of \"Apple\" by Trump between May 24 and May 30. The threats on May 23 are outside the window, and the later events don't show him saying \"Apple\" verbally. \n\nThus, the resolution should be \"No\" (p1). However, I need to double-check if any of the rallies or speeches within the date range had him mentioning \"Apple.\" \n\nWait, search result 40 from May 24 describes an awkward moment where Trump's iPhone rang during a discussion. The article mentions Trump threatening Apple with tariffs, but that's a written post. The actual event where his phone rang was on May 24, and during that press interaction, did he mention \"Apple\"? The article states he was discussing tariffs on Apple, but if he said \"Apple\" during that press interaction, which was recorded, then it counts. \n\nThe article says: \"Trump has threatened to impose a 25% tariff on iPhones if they are not made in the United States, as he stepped up the pressure on Apple to build its signature product in the country.\" But this is a written statement. However, the article also describes a press event on May 24 where Trump's phone rang, and he joked about it. If during that press conference, he verbally mentioned \"Apple,\" that would count. \n\nThe article quotes Trump as saying: \"It would be also\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 1, ID: 56478062423799129727979200140589118856818657765237382053337876678853404990242, Winner: Yes\n- Token: No, Price: 0, ID: 105099997746200250238129873221010449793469733817237190048103679898154215512821, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

But the query's timeframe starts on May 24 at 12 PM ET, so this is just outside the window. Doesn't count.\n\nResult [11] is a YouTube video from May 23, 2025, where Trump talks about Apple tariffs. Again, this is before the start time. Not relevant.\n\nResult [16] is a video from May 23, 2025, where Trump discusses tariffs on the EU and possibly Apple. Still outside the timeframe.\n\nResult [18] is a Bloomberg video from May 24, 2025. The transcript mentions Trump's threat to Apple. The exact date isn't clear, but if it's May 24, we need to check the time. The query starts at 12 PM ET on May 24. If the video was posted after that time, it might count. However, the transcript doesn't specify the exact time of the statement. Without knowing if the mention was after 12 PM ET, we can't confirm.\n\nResult [19] is a press gaggle on May 30, 2025. The transcript doesn't show any mention of \"Apple.\" He talks about steel deals and other topics but not Apple.\n\nOther results like [3], [4], [6], [8], [9], [10], [12], [13], [14], [15], [17] don't mention Apple in the context of verbal statements within the specified dates.\n\nWait, result [5] is from May 23, so before the window. Result [18] is from May 24, but without a specific time, we can't be sure if it's after 12 PM ET. The user's current time is June 9, 2025, so the event period has passed. If there's no verifiable evidence of a verbal mention within the timeframe, the answer should be \"No.\"\n\nSince all the mentions of Apple in the search results are either before the start time or the exact time isn't confirmed, there's no clear evidence Trump said \"Apple\" during the specified period. Therefore, the resolution should be p1 (No).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749487136 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-09 16:38:56 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please review additional sources or verify the accuracy of the interpreted data to align the recommendation with strong market sentiment.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump mentioned the word \"Apple\" between May 24, 12:00 PM ET and May 30, 2025, 11:59 PM ET.

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Also before the period. \n\nResults [4] and [6] are Memorial Day speeches on May 26. Let me check those transcripts. The transcripts provided don't mention \"Apple.\" \n\nResult [5] is a West Point speech on May 24. The transcript excerpt doesn't include \"Apple.\" \n\nResult [7] is a speech to Congress on March 5. Too early. \n\nResult [9] is another Congress speech transcript from March 5. No mention of Apple. \n\nResult [10] is a proclamation on May 24, but it's a written document. Doesn't count. \n\nResult [11] is about a Congress speech in 2025, but the date isn't specified. The content doesn't mention Apple. \n\nResult [12] is a press briefing on April 28. Before the period. \n\nResult [13] is a rally on April 29. Also before. \n\nResult [14] is a speech in Riyadh, but no date given. The content doesn't mention Apple. \n\nResults [15] to [19] are from May 23, discussing Trump's threats of tariffs on Apple. However, these are written statements or news articles about his social media posts. The user specified that written usages don't count. The key here is whether Trump verbally mentioned \"Apple\" in a recorded speech or video during the specified dates. \n\nLooking at result [15], it's a Substack post from May 23 mentioning Trump's threat of a 25% tariff on Apple. But this is a written post, not a verbal mention. Similarly, results [16], [17], [18], and [19] all reference Trump's social media posts or written statements from May 23. Even though the articles mention his threats, the actual mentions by Trump were in written form on Truth Social, which doesn't qualify. \n\nThe critical point is that the user requires a verbal mention in a recorded audio or video. None of the search results indicate that Trump verbally spoke about Apple during May 24-30. The only mentions are in written form, which don't count. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided sources, there's no evidence of a verbal mention of \"Apple\" by Trump in the specified timeframe. The answer should resolve to \"No,\" which corresponds to p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749487136 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-09 16:38:56 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please review additional sources or verify the accuracy of the interpreted data to align the recommendation with strong market sentiment.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Re-evaluate the available data or consider additional sources that might have been overlooked in the initial analysis. The strong market sentiment suggests there might be information or context not considered in the initial response.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump mentioned the word \"Apple\" between May 24, 12:00 PM ET and May 30, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The resolution depends on any verbal mention in a recorded and publicly accessible audio or video. Written statements or social media posts don't count. \n\nFirst, I need to check all the provided search results for any instances where Trump verbally mentioned \"Apple\" during that timeframe. Let's look at the dates of each source. \n\nSearch result [1] is from May 30, 2025, discussing Trump's June schedule. It mentions events in June, so outside the target window. \n\nResult [2] is about a May 1 commencement address. That's before May 24, so no. \n\nResult [3] is an April 25 interview transcript. Also before the period. \n\nResults [4] and [6] are Memorial Day speeches on May 26. Let me check those transcripts. The transcripts provided don't mention \"Apple.\" \n\nResult [5] is a West Point speech on May 24. The transcript excerpt doesn't include \"Apple.\" \n\nResult [7] is a speech to Congress on March 5. Too early. \n\nResult [9] is another Congress speech transcript from March 5. No mention of Apple. \n\nResult [10] is a proclamation on May 24, but it's a written document. Doesn't count. \n\nResult [11] is about a Congress speech in 2025, but the date isn't specified. The content doesn't mention Apple. \n\nResult [12] is a press briefing on April 28. Before the period. \n\nResult [13] is a rally on April 29. Also before. \n\nResult [14] is a speech in Riyadh, but no date given. The content doesn't mention Apple. \n\nResults [15] to [19] are from May 23, discussing Trump's threats of tariffs on Apple. However, these are written statements or news articles about his social media posts. The user specified that written usages don't count. The key here is whether Trump verbally mentioned \"Apple\" in a recorded speech or video during the specified dates. \n\nLooking at result [15], it's a Substack post from May 23 mentioning Trump's threat of a 25% tariff on Apple. But this is a written post, not a verbal mention. Similarly, results [16], [17], [18], and [19] all reference Trump's social media posts or written statements from May 23. Even though the articles mention his threats, the actual mentions by Trump were in written form on Truth Social, which doesn't qualify. \n\nThe critical point is that the user requires a verbal mention in a recorded audio or video. None of the search results indicate that Trump verbally spoke about Apple during May 24-30. The only mentions are in written form, which don't count. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided sources, there's no evidence of a verbal mention of \"Apple\" by Trump in the specified timeframe. The answer should resolve to \"No,\" which corresponds to p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 1, ID: 56478062423799129727979200140589118856818657765237382053337876678853404990242, Winner: Yes\n- Token: No, Price: 0, ID: 105099997746200250238129873221010449793469733817237190048103679898154215512821, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749487136 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-09 16:38:56 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please review additional sources or verify the accuracy of the interpreted data to align the recommendation with strong market sentiment."
