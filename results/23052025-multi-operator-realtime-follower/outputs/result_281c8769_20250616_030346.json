      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether Vance Luther Boelter is still on the run as of Tuesday, June 17, 2025, based on the ancillary data provided. The market resolves to \"No\" if he's in custody or if it's confirmed he's no longer being actively sought between June 14, 4 PM ET, and June 17, 11:59 PM ET. Otherwise, it resolves to \"Yes.\"\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The system mentions the current Unix timestamp is 1750042901, which translates to June 16, 2025, 03:01:41 UTC. The query's resolution period is from June 14, 4 PM ET (which is June 14, 20:00 UTC) to June 17, 11:59 PM ET (June 18, 03:59 UTC). Since the current time is June 16, the event is ongoing, and the resolution period hasn't ended yet.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are conflicting reports. Some sources from June 16 (like [11], [25], [37]) mention that Boelter was arrested. For example, source [11] states, \"Minnesota shooting suspect Vance Luther Boelter has been arrested after being found in a field near Green Isle in Sibley County, according to KSTP.\" Similarly, [25] and [37] confirm his arrest. However, other sources from June 15 and 16 (like [30], [48], [59]) indicate the manhunt is still ongoing. For instance, [30] from June 15 says, \"Boelter is still at-large,\" and [48] on June 15 mentions the BCA confirmed he's not in custody.\n\nThis discrepancy needs resolution. The key is to determine the most recent and reliable information. Sources [11], [25], and [37] are dated June 16 and report the arrest. However, the user's current timestamp is June 16, 03:01 UTC, which is early morning. If the arrest happened late on June 16 (as per [25]: \"arrested by authorities late Sunday evening in Sibley County\"), that would be after the current timestamp. Wait, the current timestamp is June 16, 03:01 UTC, which is June 15 evening in local time (Minnesota is UTC-5). So June 16 UTC is still June 15 local time. Wait, no, June 16 03:01 UTC is June 15 22:01 CDT (UTC-5). So if the arrest happened late Sunday evening (June 15 local time), that would be June 16 early morning UTC. But the current timestamp is June 16 03:01 UTC, which is just after midnight in Minnesota. So if the arrest occurred on June 15 evening local time, that's within the resolution period starting June 14 20:00 UTC. However, the sources mentioning arrest (like [11], [25], [37]) are dated June 16, which would be after the current timestamp. This is confusing because the system's current time is June 16, 03:01 UTC, but the search results include articles from June 16 that report the arrest. However, the user's query is about whether Boelter is still on the run on Tuesday, June 17. Wait, the resolution period ends on June 17, 11:59 PM ET, which is June 18, 03:59 UTC. The current time in the system is June 16, so the event is still ongoing. But the search results include information up to June 16, with some sources saying he was arrested and others saying the manhunt continues. \n\nWait, the user is asking if Boelter is still on the run as of Tuesday, June 17. But the current date in the system is June 16. The market resolves based on the period ending June 17. However, the search results include sources from June 16 stating he was arrested. For example, [25] says, \"Shooting suspect Vance Boelter was arrested by authorities late Sunday evening in Sibley County, according to a high-ranking state official.\" If Sunday evening refers to June 15 (since the current date is June 16), then the arrest occurred within the resolution period (which started June 14). Therefore, if he was arrested on June 15, the answer would be \"No\" because he's in custody. However, other sources from June 16 (like [30], [48]) still report the manhunt is ongoing. This inconsistency needs to be resolved.\n\nLooking closer, [25] is from the Star Tribune on June 16, stating he was arrested late Sunday evening. Sunday evening would be June 15, which is within the resolution period. However, other sources like [30] (WDIO, June 15) and [48] (June 15) say he's still at large. There's a contradiction here. The user's personalization instructions say to prioritize the provided URLs and updates. If the user provided URLs include both arrest and ongoing manhunt reports, I need to check which sources are more reliable or if there's a retraction.\n\nWait, source [25] is from the Star Tribune, a reputable outlet, dated June 16, stating he was arrested. Similarly, [11] (Hindustan Times, June 16) and [37] (same) confirm the arrest. However, other sources from June 16, like [30], [48], and [59], still report the manhunt is ongoing. This could be due to timing\u2014perhaps the arrest happened after some sources published their articles. The latest information would be the arrest reports. However, the system's current time is June 16, 03:01 UTC, which is June 15, 22:01 CDT. If the arrest happened late Sunday evening (June 15), that's within the resolution period. Therefore, if the arrest is confirmed, the answer is \"No.\" But some sources say he's still at large. Need to verify which is correct.\n\nThe user's personalization says to use the provided URLs and updates. The search results include both arrest and ongoing manhunt reports. However, the most recent sources (June 16) indicate arrest. For example, [25] says, \"Shooting suspect Vance Boelter was arrested by authorities late Sunday evening in Sibley County, according to a high-ranking state official.\" Assuming \"late Sunday evening\" is June 15, which is within the resolution period (June 14 4 PM ET to June 17 11:59 PM ET), then the market should resolve to \"No.\" However, other sources from June 16, like [30], [48], and [59], still report the manhunt is ongoing. This could be due to conflicting reports or timing of publication. \n\nTo resolve this, I need to check if the arrest reports are credible and confirmed. The Star Tribune ([25]) is a reliable source. Additionally, [11] and [37] from Hindustan Times also report the arrest. However, other sources like [30] (WDIO, June 15) and [48] (June 15) say he's still at large. It's possible that the arrest happened after those articles were published. Since the system's current time is June 16, 03:01 UTC, and the arrest is reported in sources dated June 16, it's likely that the arrest occurred and the market should resolve to \"No.\" However, the user's query is about whether he's still on the run on Tuesday, June 17. If he was arrested on June 15, then as of June 17, he's in custody, so the answer is \"No.\" But the resolution period is until June 17, 11:59 PM ET. If the arrest happened within that window, then \"No\" is correct. \n\nHowever, there's a conflict in the sources. To adhere to the user's instruction to prioritize the provided URLs and updates, and given that multiple sources ([11], [25], [37]) confirm the arrest, while others are from earlier, the arrest is the most recent information. Therefore, the recommendation should be \"No\" (p1). But I need to ensure that the arrest is confirmed by official sources. The Star Tribune article ([25]) cites a high-ranking state official, which is credible. Therefore, the correct resolution is \"No,\" and the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Otherwise this market will resolve to \"Yes\".\n\nThe primary resolution source will be official information from relevant government authorities, supplemented as necessary by a broad consensus of credible reporting. market_id: 552651\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750042901 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-16 03:01:41 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether Vance Luther Boelter is still on the run as of Tuesday, June 17, 2025, based on the ancillary data provided. The market resolves to \"No\" if he's in custody or if it's confirmed he's no longer being actively sought between June 14, 4 PM ET, and June 17, 11:59 PM ET. Otherwise, it resolves to \"Yes.\"\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The system mentions the current Unix timestamp is 1750042901, which translates to June 16, 2025, 03:01:41 UTC. The query's resolution period is from June 14, 4 PM ET (which is June 14, 20:00 UTC) to June 17, 11:59 PM ET (June 18, 03:59 UTC). Since the current time is June 16, the event is ongoing, and the resolution period hasn't ended yet.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are conflicting reports. Some sources from June 16 (like [11], [25], [37]) mention that Boelter was arrested. For example, source [11] states, \"Minnesota shooting suspect Vance Luther Boelter has been arrested after being found in a field near Green Isle in Sibley County, according to KSTP.\" Similarly, [25] and [37] confirm his arrest. However, other sources from June 15 and 16 (like [30], [48], [59]) indicate the manhunt is still ongoing. For instance, [30] from June 15 says, \"Boelter is still at-large,\" and [48] on June 15 mentions the BCA confirmed he's not in custody.\n\nThis discrepancy needs resolution. The key is to determine the most recent and reliable information. Sources [11], [25], and [37] are dated June 16 and report the arrest. However, the user's current timestamp is June 16, 03:01 UTC, which is early morning. If the arrest happened late on June 16 (as per [25]: \"arrested by authorities late Sunday evening in Sibley County\"), that would be after the current timestamp. Wait, the current timestamp is June 16, 03:01 UTC, which is June 15 evening in local time (Minnesota is UTC-5). So June 16 UTC is still June 15 local time. Wait, no, June 16 03:01 UTC is June 15 22:01 CDT (UTC-5). So if the arrest happened late Sunday evening (June 15 local time), that would be June 16 early morning UTC. But the current timestamp is June 16 03:01 UTC, which is just after midnight in Minnesota. So if the arrest occurred on June 15 evening local time, that's within the resolution period starting June 14 20:00 UTC. However, the sources mentioning arrest (like [11], [25], [37]) are dated June 16, which would be after the current timestamp. This is confusing because the system's current time is June 16, 03:01 UTC, but the search results include articles from June 16 that report the arrest. However, the user's query is about whether Boelter is still on the run on Tuesday, June 17. Wait, the resolution period ends on June 17, 11:59 PM ET, which is June 18, 03:59 UTC. The current time in the system is June 16, so the event is still ongoing. But the search results include information up to June 16, with some sources saying he was arrested and others saying the manhunt continues. \n\nWait, the user is asking if Boelter is still on the run as of Tuesday, June 17. But the current date in the system is June 16. The market resolves based on the period ending June 17. However, the search results include sources from June 16 stating he was arrested. For example, [25] says, \"Shooting suspect Vance Boelter was arrested by authorities late Sunday evening in Sibley County, according to a high-ranking state official.\" If Sunday evening refers to June 15 (since the current date is June 16), then the arrest occurred within the resolution period (which started June 14). Therefore, if he was arrested on June 15, the answer would be \"No\" because he's in custody. However, other sources from June 16 (like [30], [48]) still report the manhunt is ongoing. This inconsistency needs to be resolved.\n\nLooking closer, [25] is from the Star Tribune on June 16, stating he was arrested late Sunday evening. Sunday evening would be June 15, which is within the resolution period. However, other sources like [30] (WDIO, June 15) and [48] (June 15) say he's still at large. There's a contradiction here. The user's personalization instructions say to prioritize the provided URLs and updates. If the user provided URLs include both arrest and ongoing manhunt reports, I need to check which sources are more reliable or if there's a retraction.\n\nWait, source [25] is from the Star Tribune, a reputable outlet, dated June 16, stating he was arrested. Similarly, [11] (Hindustan Times, June 16) and [37] (same) confirm the arrest. However, other sources from June 16, like [30], [48], and [59], still report the manhunt is ongoing. This could be due to timing\u2014perhaps the arrest happened after some sources published their articles. The latest information would be the arrest reports. However, the system's current time is June 16, 03:01 UTC, which is June 15, 22:01 CDT. If the arrest happened late Sunday evening (June 15), that's within the resolution period. Therefore, if the arrest is confirmed, the answer is \"No.\" But some sources say he's still at large. Need to verify which is correct.\n\nThe user's personalization says to use the provided URLs and updates. The search results include both arrest and ongoing manhunt reports. However, the most recent sources (June 16) indicate arrest. For example, [25] says, \"Shooting suspect Vance Boelter was arrested by authorities late Sunday evening in Sibley County, according to a high-ranking state official.\" Assuming \"late Sunday evening\" is June 15, which is within the resolution period (June 14 4 PM ET to June 17 11:59 PM ET), then the market should resolve to \"No.\" However, other sources from June 16, like [30], [48], and [59], still report the manhunt is ongoing. This could be due to conflicting reports or timing of publication. \n\nTo resolve this, I need to check if the arrest reports are credible and confirmed. The Star Tribune ([25]) is a reliable source. Additionally, [11] and [37] from Hindustan Times also report the arrest. However, other sources like [30] (WDIO, June 15) and [48] (June 15) say he's still at large. It's possible that the arrest happened after those articles were published. Since the system's current time is June 16, 03:01 UTC, and the arrest is reported in sources dated June 16, it's likely that the arrest occurred and the market should resolve to \"No.\" However, the user's query is about whether he's still on the run on Tuesday, June 17. If he was arrested on June 15, then as of June 17, he's in custody, so the answer is \"No.\" But the resolution period is until June 17, 11:59 PM ET. If the arrest happened within that window, then \"No\" is correct. \n\nHowever, there's a conflict in the sources. To adhere to the user's instruction to prioritize the provided URLs and updates, and given that multiple sources ([11], [25], [37]) confirm the arrest, while others are from earlier, the arrest is the most recent information. Therefore, the recommendation should be \"No\" (p1). But I need to ensure that the arrest is confirmed by official sources. The Star Tribune article ([25]) cites a high-ranking state official, which is credible. Therefore, the correct resolution is \"No,\" and the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.003, ID: 8789460683715788008880694265359250729986653669465959677342513082670505269016, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.997, ID: 113569605677491128707620297427483946153040185757092892011497367972831880747657, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (0.997 = 99.7% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
