The market resolution conditions are:\n- p1: Tomas Machac wins (market resolves to \"Machac\")\n- p2: Fabian Marozsan wins (market resolves to \"Marozsan\")\n- p3: 50-50 (if the match ends in a tie, is canceled, or delayed beyond June 26, 2025)\n\nThe current date and time is 2025-06-19 14:09:22 UTC (as per the Unix timestamp 1750342162). The match is scheduled for June 19, 2025, at 7:30 AM ET (which is 11:30 AM UTC, since ET is UTC-4 in summer). Therefore, the match should have already started and likely concluded by the current time (14:09 UTC).\n\nWe have search results that provide information about the match. We must verify the outcome of the match using the primary resolution source (Terra Wortmann Open official site) or a consensus of credible reporting.\n\nReviewing the search results:\n\n[1] and [3] provide results from the first round, showing that Machac defeated De Jong and Marozsan defeated Kecmanovic. They are set to play each other in the second round.\n\n[5], [7], [12], [13], and [14] indicate that the match between Marozsan and Machac is scheduled for June 19, 2025. Specifically:\n- [5] states: \"Tomas Machac will play the next match on Jun 19, 2025, 9:30:00 AM UTC against Fabian Marozsan in Halle.\"\n- [13] states: \"Fabian Marozsan vs Tomas Machac live match starts on 19 Jun 2025 at 12:50 UTC\"\n- [14] states: \"Fabian Marozsan vs Tomas Machac live score - ATP Halle Open 19 June 2025\" and shows a start time of 19/06/2025 04:30 (which might be in a different time zone, but the date is June 19).\n\nHowever, we need the result of the match. The current time is 14:09 UTC on June 19, 2025. The match was scheduled for the morning (9:30 AM or 12:50 PM UTC). Therefore, it should be over.\n\nLooking for result information:\n\n[1] and [3] do not have the result because they are from the first round.\n\n[2] is the ATP Tour results page for Halle, but it does not show the result for Marozsan vs. Machac.\n\n[4] is the schedule for the Terra Wortmann Open, but it is for the previous day (June 18) and does not show the result for June 19.\n\n[6] is the player profile for Tomas Machac and does not have the match result.\n\n[7] is a preview of the match and does not have the result.\n\n[8] is a PDF of the 2024 tournament, which is not relevant.\n\n[9] is the schedule for the day (June 19) but does not show results.\n\n[10] is the list of players and does not have results.\n\n[11] is the ATP Tour stats center for the match, but it does not show the result (it says \"LiveSingles Round of 16\" but no data).\n\n[12] is a head-to-head page that does not show the result.\n\n[13] is a live score page that says the match starts at 12:50 UTC and provides a live score, but the page does not show a completed result.\n\n[14] is a live score page that shows a completed match with the score: \n  Fabian Marozsan vs Tomas Machac: 0-2 (2-6, 3-6)\nThis means Machac won in straight sets: 6-2, 6-3.\n\nThe [14] page also states: \"The Fabian Marozsan - Tomas Machac (Tennis - ATP Halle Open) match in 19/06/2025 08:50 is now complete. The Fabian Marozsan - Tomas Machac result is as follows: 0-2 (2-6, 3-6)\"\n\nTherefore, we have a credible source (sportytrader.com) reporting the result. Additionally, we can cross-verify with other sources.\n\n[5] (Sofascore) also has a page for the match, but we don't have the exact content. However, [14] is consistent and detailed.\n\nGiven that the match is over and we have a reported result, we can conclude that Tomas Machac won.\n\nTherefore, the market should resolve to \"Machac\", which corresponds to p1.\n\nNote: The primary resolution source is the official Terra Wortmann Open site. However, we do not have a direct link to the result on their site. But the ancillary data allows for a consensus of credible reporting.

Where p1 corresponds to Machac, p2 to Marozsan, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750342162 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-19 14:09:22 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nWe are given a query about a tennis match between Fabian Marozsan and Tomas Machac at the Terra Wortmann Open (Halle) on June 19, 2025. The market resolution conditions are:\n- p1: Tomas Machac wins (market resolves to \"Machac\")\n- p2: Fabian Marozsan wins (market resolves to \"Marozsan\")\n- p3: 50-50 (if the match ends in a tie, is canceled, or delayed beyond June 26, 2025)\n\nThe current date and time is 2025-06-19 14:09:22 UTC (as per the Unix timestamp 1750342162). The match is scheduled for June 19, 2025, at 7:30 AM ET (which is 11:30 AM UTC, since ET is UTC-4 in summer). Therefore, the match should have already started and likely concluded by the current time (14:09 UTC).\n\nWe have search results that provide information about the match. We must verify the outcome of the match using the primary resolution source (Terra Wortmann Open official site) or a consensus of credible reporting.\n\nReviewing the search results:\n\n[1] and [3] provide results from the first round, showing that Machac defeated De Jong and Marozsan defeated Kecmanovic. They are set to play each other in the second round.\n\n[5], [7], [12], [13], and [14] indicate that the match between Marozsan and Machac is scheduled for June 19, 2025. Specifically:\n- [5] states: \"Tomas Machac will play the next match on Jun 19, 2025, 9:30:00 AM UTC against Fabian Marozsan in Halle.\"\n- [13] states: \"Fabian Marozsan vs Tomas Machac live match starts on 19 Jun 2025 at 12:50 UTC\"\n- [14] states: \"Fabian Marozsan vs Tomas Machac live score - ATP Halle Open 19 June 2025\" and shows a start time of 19/06/2025 04:30 (which might be in a different time zone, but the date is June 19).\n\nHowever, we need the result of the match. The current time is 14:09 UTC on June 19, 2025. The match was scheduled for the morning (9:30 AM or 12:50 PM UTC). Therefore, it should be over.\n\nLooking for result information:\n\n[1] and [3] do not have the result because they are from the first round.\n\n[2] is the ATP Tour results page for Halle, but it does not show the result for Marozsan vs. Machac.\n\n[4] is the schedule for the Terra Wortmann Open, but it is for the previous day (June 18) and does not show the result for June 19.\n\n[6] is the player profile for Tomas Machac and does not have the match result.\n\n[7] is a preview of the match and does not have the result.\n\n[8] is a PDF of the 2024 tournament, which is not relevant.\n\n[9] is the schedule for the day (June 19) but does not show results.\n\n[10] is the list of players and does not have results.\n\n[11] is the ATP Tour stats center for the match, but it does not show the result (it says \"LiveSingles Round of 16\" but no data).\n\n[12] is a head-to-head page that does not show the result.\n\n[13] is a live score page that says the match starts at 12:50 UTC and provides a live score, but the page does not show a completed result.\n\n[14] is a live score page that shows a completed match with the score: \n  Fabian Marozsan vs Tomas Machac: 0-2 (2-6, 3-6)\nThis means Machac won in straight sets: 6-2, 6-3.\n\nThe [14] page also states: \"The Fabian Marozsan - Tomas Machac (Tennis - ATP Halle Open) match in 19/06/2025 08:50 is now complete. The Fabian Marozsan - Tomas Machac result is as follows: 0-2 (2-6, 3-6)\"\n\nTherefore, we have a credible source (sportytrader.com) reporting the result. Additionally, we can cross-verify with other sources.\n\n[5] (Sofascore) also has a page for the match, but we don't have the exact content. However, [14] is consistent and detailed.\n\nGiven that the match is over and we have a reported result, we can conclude that Tomas Machac won.\n\nTherefore, the market should resolve to \"Machac\", which corresponds to p1.\n\nNote: The primary resolution source is the official Terra Wortmann Open site. However, we do not have a direct link to the result on their site. But the ancillary data allows for a consensus of credible reporting. Since sportytrader.com is a credible sports news site and we have no conflicting reports, we can rely on it.\n\nThus, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n### Analysis of the Terra Wortmann Open Round 2 Match: Fabian Marozsan vs. Tomas Machac  \n\nThe Round 2 match between Fabian Marozsan and Tomas Machac at the 2025 Terra Wortmann Open in Halle, Germany, concluded with a decisive outcome.

Where p1 corresponds to Machac, p2 to Marozsan, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Machac, p2 = Marozsan\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Machac outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.956 = 95.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.
