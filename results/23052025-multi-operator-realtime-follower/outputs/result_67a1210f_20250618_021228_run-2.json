Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Bitcoin Up or Down - June 17, 9 PM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for BTC/USDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTC/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTC/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 552257\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.

Recommendation found: p3.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p3\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.025, ID: 110572007285391830989739049215768634013376773910158423649686630632115552203041, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.975, ID: 72814549748755105895138306616148914860532831432698725986703099375043857898406, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.975 = 97.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTC/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTC/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 552257\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Bitcoin Up or Down - June 17, 9 PM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for BTC/USDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTC/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTC/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 552257\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date.

Recommendation found: p3.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p3\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.025, ID: 110572007285391830989739049215768634013376773910158423649686630632115552203041, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.975, ID: 72814549748755105895138306616148914860532831432698725986703099375043857898406, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.975 = 97.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on whether the BTC/USDT 1-hour candle starting at June 17, 9 PM ET closed up or down. The resolution source is Binance's BTC/USDT pair, specifically the change value displayed for that 1H candle.\n\nFirst, I need to convert 9 PM ET to UTC. ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time. So 9 PM ET would be 1 AM UTC the next day. Wait, June 17, 9 PM ET is the same as June 18, 1 AM UTC. But the current timestamp given is June 18, 2025, 2:07:34 UTC. The event time was June 17, 9 PM ET, which is June 18, 1 AM UTC. Since the current time is past that, the event has already occurred.\n\nNext, I need to check the search results for any data related to that specific 1-hour candle. The search results include various sources about BTC/USDT prices, Binance announcements, and historical data. Looking at the Binance-related links, like [25] and [26], which mention Binance's BTC/USDT trading pair and specific timestamps. However, the exact 1H candle data for June 18, 1 AM UTC might not be directly listed. \n\nLooking at the search results, [29] and [30] mention BTC/USDT prices around similar times. For example, [29] shows a price of $105,838.0 on June 17, 2025, but that's the daily close. [30] has a 1-minute chart analysis but doesn't specify the exact hour. [34] and [35] discuss technical analysis but not the specific candle. \n\nWait, the user provided the current time as June 18, 2:07:34 UTC. The candle in question is from 1 AM to 2 AM UTC on June 18. Since the current time is after 2 AM, the candle should have closed, and the data should be available. However, the search results don't explicitly show the change percentage for that exact 1H window. \n\nI need to infer from the available data. For example, [58] mentions a BTC price of $81,778 with a 0.08% increase, but that's from a different date. [59] talks about a 22% volume increase but not the price change. [56] has a current price of $104,824 but that's from a different context. \n\nSince the search results don't provide the exact percentage change for the 1H candle ending at 2 AM UTC on June 18, but the event time is in the past, and assuming no contradictory information, the resolution would depend on the actual data from Binance. However, without explicit data in the provided sources, I might have to default to the most probable outcome based on the conditions. \n\nBut wait, the personalization instructions say if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, resolve based on the most probable outcome. However, the user's query includes specific resolution conditions. Since the event has occurred, but the sources don't confirm the change, I should check if any sources mention the price movement around that time. \n\nLooking again, [29] mentions BTC price at $105,838 on June 17, but that's the daily close. [30] has a 1-minute chart from June 17, 2025, but the exact hour isn't clear. [56] from June 17 shows a 0.08% increase, but that's a different timeframe. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit data, but the event time has passed, and assuming the market resolves based on Binance's data, which isn't contradicted here, the safest recommendation would be p4 (cannot resolve) if no data is found. However, the instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The query's ancillary data says p1 is Down, p2 is Up. If the change is >=0, it's Up (p2). Without data, but given the market's nature, perhaps the price was up. But without concrete info, maybe p3 (unknown). But the user's personalization says if no info, assume most probable. However, without data, it's unclear. \n\nWait, the current timestamp is June 18, 2:07 UTC. The candle closed at 2 AM UTC. The user's data includes search results up to that time. For example, [29] from coinalyze.net shows a 1H chart with a 0.08% increase. If that's the relevant candle, then the change is positive, so p2. But I need to confirm if that's the correct timeframe. \n\nAlternatively, [56] mentions a current price of $104,824, but the time isn't specified. If the 1H candle closed with a positive change, then p2. But without explicit confirmation, it's risky. However, the instructions say to use the provided sources. If none of the sources explicitly state the change for that exact hour, the recommendation would be p4. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. Since the query's resolution conditions are based on Binance's data, and assuming the data is available but not provided in the search results, perhaps the answer is p2 (Up) if the change was >=0. But without explicit data, it's uncertain. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the instructions to resolve as per the conditions and available data, if no sources contradict, and assuming the event has occurred, the recommendation would be p2 (Up) if the change was positive. However, without explicit data, it's safer to go with p4. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since the market is about whether the change is >=0, and if the price at the close was higher than the open, then p2. If not, p1. \n\nBut without the exact data, I can't be certain. However, looking at the search results, [29] mentions BTC price at $105,838 on June 17, and [56] shows a 0.08% increase. If that's the relevant period, then p2. But I need to ensure the time aligns. Since the candle is 1H starting at 9 PM ET (1 AM UTC), the close would be 2 AM UTC. The current timestamp is 2:07 UTC, so the data should be available. If the change was positive, p2. Otherwise, p1. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit data in the search results, but the instructions to use the provided sources, and if no data is found, answer as per existing knowledge. Since I can't find the exact change percentage in the provided sources, but the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome if the event is in the past. If the market is about whether the change is >=0, and assuming that the price didn't drop, the most probable might be p2. But this is a guess. However, the correct approach is to check if any source mentions the specific candle. \n\nLooking again, [25] is the Binance BTC/USDT trading page. The search result snippet doesn't show the specific candle, but the URL is correct. If the data isn't in the provided snippets, but the event is past, and the resolution source is Binance, then the answer should be based on that. Since the user can't access live data, but the event is past, and assuming the data is available, but not in the provided context, the assistant should recommend p4. However, the personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nIn the absence of explicit data, but given the market's structure, it's a 50-50 chance, but the ancillary data says p3 is 0.5. However, the resolution conditions are p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: 50-50. If no data, p3. But the instructions say if no info, assume most probable. However, the event has occurred, so it's either p1 or p2. Without data, the correct recommendation is p4. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. \n\nThis is conflicting. The event has occurred, so it's not a future event. If no info is available, but the event is in the past, the resolution should be based on the most probable outcome. However, without data, it's impossible to determine.

The user wants to resolve a market based on whether the BTC/USDT 1-hour candle starting at June 17, 9 PM ET closed up or down. The resolution source is Binance's BTC/USDT pair, specifically the change value displayed for that 1H candle.\n\nFirst, I need to convert 9 PM ET to UTC. ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time. So 9 PM ET would be 1 AM UTC the next day. Wait, June 17, 9 PM ET is the same as June 18, 1 AM UTC. But the current timestamp given is June 18, 2025, 2:07:34 UTC. The event time was June 17, 9 PM ET, which is June 18, 1 AM UTC. Since the current time is past that, the event has already occurred.\n\nNext, I need to check the search results for any data related to that specific 1-hour candle. The search results include various sources about BTC/USDT prices, Binance announcements, and historical data. Looking at the Binance-related links, like [25] and [26], which mention Binance's BTC/USDT trading pair and specific timestamps. However, the exact 1H candle data for June 18, 1 AM UTC might not be directly listed. \n\nLooking at the search results, [29] and [30] mention BTC/USDT prices around similar times. For example, [29] shows a price of $105,838.0 on June 17, 2025, but that's the daily close. [30] has a 1-minute chart analysis but doesn't specify the exact hour. [34] and [35] discuss technical analysis but not the specific candle. \n\nWait, the user provided the current time as June 18, 2:07:34 UTC. The candle in question is from 1 AM to 2 AM UTC on June 18. Since the current time is after 2 AM, the candle should have closed, and the data should be available. However, the search results don't explicitly show the change percentage for that exact 1H window. \n\nI need to infer from the available data. For example, [58] mentions a BTC price of $81,778 with a 0.08% increase, but that's from a different date. [59] talks about a 22% volume increase but not the price change. [56] has a current price of $104,824 but that's from a different context. \n\nSince the search results don't provide the exact percentage change for the 1H candle ending at 2 AM UTC on June 18, but the event time is in the past, and assuming no contradictory information, the resolution would depend on the actual data from Binance. However, without explicit data in the provided sources, I might have to default to the most probable outcome based on the conditions. \n\nBut wait, the personalization instructions say if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, resolve based on the most probable outcome. However, the user's query includes specific resolution conditions. Since the event has occurred, but the sources don't confirm the change, I should check if any sources mention the price movement around that time. \n\nLooking again, [29] mentions BTC price at $105,838 on June 17, but that's the daily close. [30] has a 1-minute chart from June 17, 2025, but the exact hour isn't clear. [56] from June 17 shows a 0.08% increase, but that's a different timeframe. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit data, but the event time has passed, and assuming the market resolves based on Binance's data, which isn't contradicted here, the safest recommendation would be p4 (cannot resolve) if no data is found. However, the instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The query's ancillary data says p1 is Down, p2 is Up. If the change is >=0, it's Up (p2). Without data, but given the market's nature, perhaps the price was up. But without concrete info, maybe p3 (unknown). But the user's personalization says if no info, assume most probable. However, without data, it's unclear. \n\nWait, the current timestamp is June 18, 2:07 UTC. The candle closed at 2 AM UTC. The user's data includes search results up to that time. For example, [29] from coinalyze.net shows a 1H chart with a 0.08% increase. If that's the relevant candle, then the change is positive, so p2. But I need to confirm if that's the correct timeframe. \n\nAlternatively, [56] mentions a current price of $104,824, but the time isn't specified. If the 1H candle closed with a positive change, then p2. But without explicit confirmation, it's risky. However, the instructions say to use the provided sources. If none of the sources explicitly state the change for that exact hour, the recommendation would be p4. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. Since the query's resolution conditions are based on Binance's data, and assuming the data is available but not provided in the search results, perhaps the answer is p2 (Up) if the change was >=0. But without explicit data, it's uncertain. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the instructions to resolve as per the conditions and available data, if no sources contradict, and assuming the event has occurred, the recommendation would be p2 (Up) if the change was positive. However, without explicit data, it's safer to go with p4. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since the market is about whether the change is >=0, and if the price at the close was higher than the open, then p2. If not, p1. \n\nBut without the exact data, I can't be certain. However, looking at the search results, [29] mentions BTC price at $105,838 on June 17, and [56] shows a 0.08% increase. If that's the relevant period, then p2. But I need to ensure the time aligns. Since the candle is 1H starting at 9 PM ET (1 AM UTC), the close would be 2 AM UTC. The current timestamp is 2:07 UTC, so the data should be available. If the change was positive, p2. Otherwise, p1. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit data in the search results, but the instructions to use the provided sources, and if no data is found, answer as per existing knowledge. Since I can't find the exact change percentage in the provided sources, but the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome if the event is in the past. If the market is about whether the change is >=0, and assuming that the price didn't drop, the most probable might be p2. But this is a guess. However, the correct approach is to check if any source mentions the specific candle. \n\nLooking again, [25] is the Binance BTC/USDT trading page. The search result snippet doesn't show the specific candle, but the URL is correct. If the data isn't in the provided snippets, but the event is past, and the resolution source is Binance, then the answer should be based on that. Since the user can't access live data, but the event is past, and assuming the data is available, but not in the provided context, the assistant should recommend p4. However, the personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nIn the absence of explicit data, but given the market's structure, it's a 50-50 chance, but the ancillary data says p3 is 0.5. However, the resolution conditions are p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: 50-50. If no data, p3. But the instructions say if no info, assume most probable. However, the event has occurred, so it's either p1 or p2. Without data, the correct recommendation is p4. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. \n\nThis is conflicting. The event has occurred, so it's not a future event. If no info is available, but the event is in the past, the resolution should be based on the most probable outcome. However, without data, it's impossible to determine. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.025, ID: 110572007285391830989739049215768634013376773910158423649686630632115552203041, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.975, ID: 72814549748755105895138306616148914860532831432698725986703099375043857898406, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.975 = 97.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

The resolution depends on the percentage change of that specific candle on Binance. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp given is June 18, 2025, 02:07:34 UTC. June 17, 9 PM ET is equivalent to June 18, 01:00 UTC (since ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time). The event time (June 18, 01:00 UTC) has already passed, so the data should be available.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources provide historical data. For example, source [4] from CoinMarketCap shows BTC/USDT rates. On June 17, 2025, the closing price was 104,590.52 USDT with a -2.02% change. However, this might be the daily close, not the 1-hour candle. \n\nSource [3] mentions Bitcoin's price on June 13, 2025, at 104,500 USDT, but that's a different date. Source [34] from Forex24.pro's forecast on June 18, 2025, mentions a price of 104,219, but this is a prediction, not actual data. \n\nThe key is to find the exact 1-hour candle data for June 18, 01:00 UTC. Source [4] provides a table with hourly data, but the dates listed are up to June 17, 2025. Source [16] from Kaggle includes 1-hour historical data up to January 2025, but the exact timestamp isn't clear. \n\nSince the event time has passed, but the provided search results don't explicitly show the 1-hour change for that specific candle, I might need to infer. If the closing price after the 1-hour candle shows a negative percentage change, the resolution would be \"Down\" (p1). However, without explicit data for that exact hour, there's uncertainty. \n\nThe user's additional instruction mentions considering market conditions if data is unavailable. The ancillary data defines p1 as Down, p2 as Up, p3 as uncertain. Since the event date is in the past and no explicit data confirms the change, but some sources indicate a downward trend around that time, the most probable outcome is Down.

The event time (June 18, 01:00 UTC) has already passed, so the data should be available.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources provide historical data. For example, source [4] from CoinMarketCap shows BTC/USDT rates. On June 17, 2025, the closing price was 104,590.52 USDT with a -2.02% change. However, this might be the daily close, not the 1-hour candle. \n\nSource [3] mentions Bitcoin's price on June 13, 2025, at 104,500 USDT, but that's a different date. Source [34] from Forex24.pro's forecast on June 18, 2025, mentions a price of 104,219, but this is a prediction, not actual data. \n\nThe key is to find the exact 1-hour candle data for June 18, 01:00 UTC. Source [4] provides a table with hourly data, but the dates listed are up to June 17, 2025. Source [16] from Kaggle includes 1-hour historical data up to January 2025, but the exact timestamp isn't clear. \n\nSince the event time has passed, but the provided search results don't explicitly show the 1-hour change for that specific candle, I might need to infer. If the closing price after the 1-hour candle shows a negative percentage change, the resolution would be \"Down\" (p1). However, without explicit data for that exact hour, there's uncertainty. \n\nThe user's additional instruction mentions considering market conditions if data is unavailable. The ancillary data defines p1 as Down, p2 as Up, p3 as uncertain. Since the event date is in the past and no explicit data confirms the change, but some sources indicate a downward trend around that time, the most probable outcome is Down. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.025, ID: 110572007285391830989739049215768634013376773910158423649686630632115552203041, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.975, ID: 72814549748755105895138306616148914860532831432698725986703099375043857898406, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.975 = 97.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750212454 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-18 02:07:34 UTC",
