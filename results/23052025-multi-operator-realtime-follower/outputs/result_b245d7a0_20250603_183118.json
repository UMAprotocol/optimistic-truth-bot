      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the TYLOO vs NRG match in the BLAST.tv Austin Major Stage 1. The resolution depends on who wins the match, with specific conditions for p1 (NRG), p2 (TYLOO), and p3 (tie, canceled, or delayed beyond June 28, 2025).\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp given is June 3, 2025, 18:18:02 UTC. The match is scheduled for June 3, 2025, at 13:30 ET, which is 17:30 UTC. Since the current time is 18:18 UTC, the match should have already taken place. However, the search results don't explicitly state the outcome yet. \n\nLooking at the search results, most sources (like [2], [7], [9], [10], [14], [16], [22], [25], [29], [40], [44], [48], [51], [52], [58], [60], [66]) mention the match is upcoming or in progress but don't provide the result. Some predictions favor TYLOO based on recent form and map statistics. For example, source [7] and [44] predict TYLOO's victory, citing their aggressive playstyle and recent wins. However, predictions aren't official results.\n\nThe resolution source specified is HLTV.org. Checking the provided HLTV links ([1], [6], [19], [23], [41], [46], [47], [54], [57], [59], [61]), none of them list the match result yet. The most recent HLTV update in the search results doesn't include the outcome of this specific match. \n\nSince the match date is today and the current time is past the scheduled start, but there's no official result reported in the provided sources, I need to determine if the event occurred as planned. The user instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. However, the ancillary data specifies that if the match is delayed beyond June 28, 2025, it resolves to p3. Since today is June 3, the match isn't delayed beyond June 28 yet. \n\nGiven the lack of official results in the provided context and the requirement to use HLTV as the resolution source, which hasn't updated the result, the safest conclusion is that the outcome isn't verifiable yet. However, the user's personalization instructions mention that if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. The predictions heavily favor TYLOO, so under the ancillary data, p2 (TYLOO) would be the resolution. But since the official source (HLTV) isn't showing the result, there's a conflict. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The predictions and recent form of TYLOO suggest they are more likely to win. However, the strict instruction is to rely on the resolution source (HLTV). Since HLTV doesn't have the result yet, but the event date is today, and it's past the scheduled time, perhaps the match is still ongoing or the result isn't published. In such cases, the resolution should be p3 (50-50) only if it's canceled or delayed beyond June 28. Since it's not delayed beyond that date, but just hasn't been reported yet, maybe we should wait. However, the current timestamp is June 3, 18:18 UTC, which is after the match time. If the match was played and no result is found, but the event date is past, the instructions say to assume the most probable outcome. Therefore, based on the provided sources' predictions and TYLOO's recent performance, the recommendation would be p2 (TYLOO). But I need to confirm if any source in the provided context mentions the result. \n\nLooking again, source [50] talks about TYLOO's previous match in the Asian Champions League, not this Major. Other sources like [29] and [40] discuss predictions but not the actual result. Since there's no official result in the provided search results, and the resolution source (HLTV) isn't updated, but the event date is today, I have to follow the user's instruction: if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. Therefore, p2 (TYLOO) is the recommendation.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the TYLOO vs NRG match in the BLAST.tv Austin Major Stage 1. The resolution depends on who wins the match, with specific conditions for p1 (NRG), p2 (TYLOO), and p3 (tie, canceled, or delayed beyond June 28, 2025).\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp given is June 3, 2025, 18:18:02 UTC. The match is scheduled for June 3, 2025, at 13:30 ET, which is 17:30 UTC. Since the current time is 18:18 UTC, the match should have already taken place. However, the search results don't explicitly state the outcome yet. \n\nLooking at the search results, most sources (like [2], [7], [9], [10], [14], [16], [22], [25], [29], [40], [44], [48], [51], [52], [58], [60], [66]) mention the match is upcoming or in progress but don't provide the result. Some predictions favor TYLOO based on recent form and map statistics. For example, source [7] and [44] predict TYLOO's victory, citing their aggressive playstyle and recent wins. However, predictions aren't official results.\n\nThe resolution source specified is HLTV.org. Checking the provided HLTV links ([1], [6], [19], [23], [41], [46], [47], [54], [57], [59], [61]), none of them list the match result yet. The most recent HLTV update in the search results doesn't include the outcome of this specific match. \n\nSince the match date is today and the current time is past the scheduled start, but there's no official result reported in the provided sources, I need to determine if the event occurred as planned. The user instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. However, the ancillary data specifies that if the match is delayed beyond June 28, 2025, it resolves to p3. Since today is June 3, the match isn't delayed beyond June 28 yet. \n\nGiven the lack of official results in the provided context and the requirement to use HLTV as the resolution source, which hasn't updated the result, the safest conclusion is that the outcome isn't verifiable yet. However, the user's personalization instructions mention that if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. The predictions heavily favor TYLOO, so under the ancillary data, p2 (TYLOO) would be the resolution. But since the official source (HLTV) isn't showing the result, there's a conflict. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The predictions and recent form of TYLOO suggest they are more likely to win. However, the strict instruction is to rely on the resolution source (HLTV). Since HLTV doesn't have the result yet, but the event date is today, and it's past the scheduled time, perhaps the match is still ongoing or the result isn't published. In such cases, the resolution should be p3 (50-50) only if it's canceled or delayed beyond June 28. Since it's not delayed beyond that date, but just hasn't been reported yet, maybe we should wait. However, the current timestamp is June 3, 18:18 UTC, which is after the match time. If the match was played and no result is found, but the event date is past, the instructions say to assume the most probable outcome. Therefore, based on the provided sources' predictions and TYLOO's recent performance, the recommendation would be p2 (TYLOO). But I need to confirm if any source in the provided context mentions the result. \n\nLooking again, source [50] talks about TYLOO's previous match in the Asian Champions League, not this Major. Other sources like [29] and [40] discuss predictions but not the actual result. Since there's no official result in the provided search results, and the resolution source (HLTV) isn't updated, but the event date is today, I have to follow the user's instruction: if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. Therefore, p2 (TYLOO) is the recommendation.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: TYLOO, Price: 0.095, ID: 85862609979965960498500210342040897523609874648187357108663906675330867006408, Winner: No\n- Token: NRG, Price: 0.905, ID: 40447233246071142526803322832983264254920933591084207641151404737974877962562, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to NRG, p2 to TYLOO, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = NRG, p2 = TYLOO\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NRG outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.905 = 90.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Where p1 corresponds to NRG, p2 to TYLOO, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = NRG, p2 = TYLOO\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NRG outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.905 = 90.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.
