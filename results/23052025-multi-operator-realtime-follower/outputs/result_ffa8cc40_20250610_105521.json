      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump mentioned \"Epstein\" between June 5, 5:30 PM ET and June 9, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The resolution depends on any verbal mention recorded in audio or video that's publicly accessible. Written statements don't count, and videos filmed outside the timeframe are excluded.\n\nFirst, I need to check all the provided search results for any instances where Trump verbally said \"Epstein\" during that period. The search results span from June 5 to June 10, 2025. Let's go through each one.\n\nLooking at the sources:\n\n1. **Source [1] (Time.com, June 7):** Discusses Musk's allegations and the push to release Epstein files. Mentions Trump's past comments but no indication he spoke \"Epstein\" in the specified window.\n2. **Source [2] (Euronews, June 6):** Covers Musk's accusations. Quotes Trump denying involvement but doesn't specify if he said \"Epstein\" verbally in the timeframe.\n3. **Source [3] (ABC News, June 5):** Details the feud. Trump's responses are quoted, but no direct mention of him saying \"Epstein.\"\n4. **Source [4] (Economic Times, June 6):** Focuses on the 1992 video and past associations. No recent verbal mentions by Trump.\n5. **Source [5] (YouTube, June 6):** Seth Meyers' show mentions the feud but no new Trump statements.\n6. **Source [6] (CBS News, June 6):** Trump's comments on Musk, no mention of \"Epstein.\"\n7. **Source [7] (Fortune, June 5):** Musk's claims, Trump's past statements, but no recent verbal mention.\n8. **Source [8] (YouTube, June 7):** NDTV report includes a transcript where Trump is asked about Epstein. Wait, here's a key point. The transcript from June 6 (within the timeframe) has Trump responding to questions about Epstein. Let me check the timestamp. The video is from June 7, but the transcript includes a press gaggle on June 6. In the transcript, when asked about Musk's allegations, Trump says, \"That's called 'old news.' That's been old news. That has been talked about for years. Even Epstein's lawyer said I had nothing to do with it -- it's old news.\" Here, Trump explicitly says \"Epstein\" in a verbal response recorded on June 6, which is within the market's timeframe.\n\n9. **Source [9] (ABC News, June 6):** Trump calls Musk \"lost his mind,\" no mention of Epstein.\n10. **Source [10] (Axios, June 6):** Democrats probing, no Trump statements.\n11. **Source [11] (NBC Washington, June 6):** Focus on tariffs, no Epstein mention.\n12. **Source [12] (YouTube, June 7):** Press gaggle on Air Force One, June 6. In the transcript, when asked about Musk's claims, Trump refers to Epstein by name: \"That's called 'old news.'... Even Epstein's lawyer said I had nothing to do with it...\" This is a verbal mention recorded on June 6, within the timeframe.\n13. **Source [13] (Yubanet, June 10):** About troop mobilization, unrelated.\n14. **Source [14] (ABC News, June 7):** Musk deletes posts. Trump's interview with NBC on June 7 mentions Epstein: \"That's called 'old news.'... Even Epstein's lawyer said I had nothing to do with it...\" Another verbal mention within the timeframe.\n15. **Source [15] (Sky News, June 6):** Quotes Trump's past statements, no new mentions.\n\nFrom sources [8], [12], and [14], Trump verbally mentioned \"Epstein\" during press interactions on June 6 and 7, which fall within the June 5-9 window. These are recorded and publicly accessible, meeting the market's conditions. Therefore, the resolution should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The user wants to know if Donald Trump mentioned \"Epstein\" between June 5, 5:30 PM ET and June 9, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The resolution depends on any verbal mention recorded in audio or video that's publicly accessible. Written statements don't count, and videos filmed outside the timeframe are excluded.\n\nFirst, I need to check all the provided search results for any instances where Trump verbally said \"Epstein\" during that period. The search results span from June 5 to June 10, 2025. Let's go through each one.\n\nLooking at the sources:\n\n1. **Source [1] (Time.com, June 7):** Discusses Musk's allegations and the push to release Epstein files. Mentions Trump's past comments but no indication he spoke \"Epstein\" in the specified window.\n2. **Source [2] (Euronews, June 6):** Covers Musk's accusations. Quotes Trump denying involvement but doesn't specify if he said \"Epstein\" verbally in the timeframe.\n3. **Source [3] (ABC News, June 5):** Details the feud. Trump's responses are quoted, but no direct mention of him saying \"Epstein.\"\n4. **Source [4] (Economic Times, June 6):** Focuses on the 1992 video and past associations. No recent verbal mentions by Trump.\n5. **Source [5] (YouTube, June 6):** Seth Meyers' show mentions the feud but no new Trump statements.\n6. **Source [6] (CBS News, June 6):** Trump's comments on Musk, no mention of \"Epstein.\"\n7. **Source [7] (Fortune, June 5):** Musk's claims, Trump's past statements, but no recent verbal mention.\n8. **Source [8] (YouTube, June 7):** NDTV report includes a transcript where Trump is asked about Epstein. Wait, here's a key point. The transcript from June 6 (within the timeframe) has Trump responding to questions about Epstein. Let me check the timestamp. The video is from June 7, but the transcript includes a press gaggle on June 6. In the transcript, when asked about Musk's allegations, Trump says, \"That's called 'old news.' That's been old news. That has been talked about for years. Even Epstein's lawyer said I had nothing to do with it -- it's old news.\" Here, Trump explicitly says \"Epstein\" in a verbal response recorded on June 6, which is within the market's timeframe.\n\n9. **Source [9] (ABC News, June 6):** Trump calls Musk \"lost his mind,\" no mention of Epstein.\n10. **Source [10] (Axios, June 6):** Democrats probing, no Trump statements.\n11. **Source [11] (NBC Washington, June 6):** Focus on tariffs, no Epstein mention.\n12. **Source [12] (YouTube, June 7):** Press gaggle on Air Force One, June 6. In the transcript, when asked about Musk's claims, Trump refers to Epstein by name: \"That's called 'old news.'... Even Epstein's lawyer said I had nothing to do with it...\" This is a verbal mention recorded on June 6, within the timeframe.\n13. **Source [13] (Yubanet, June 10):** About troop mobilization, unrelated.\n14. **Source [14] (ABC News, June 7):** Musk deletes posts. Trump's interview with NBC on June 7 mentions Epstein: \"That's called 'old news.'... Even Epstein's lawyer said I had nothing to do with it...\" Another verbal mention within the timeframe.\n15. **Source [15] (Sky News, June 6):** Quotes Trump's past statements, no new mentions.\n\nFrom sources [8], [12], and [14], Trump verbally mentioned \"Epstein\" during press interactions on June 6 and 7, which fall within the June 5-9 window. These are recorded and publicly accessible, meeting the market's conditions. Therefore, the resolution should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0, ID: 28442530143057196297399446772793963406922103772308774239429521423862650294530, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 1, ID: 79693568198826700802930428552519118745710043525728010427499490650787407020737, Winner: Yes\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
