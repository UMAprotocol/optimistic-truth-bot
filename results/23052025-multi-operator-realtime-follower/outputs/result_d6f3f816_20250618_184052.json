      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Jerome Powell will say the word \"volatile\" during his June 18, 2025, FOMC press conference. The resolution depends on whether he uses that exact term, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. The answer needs to be either Yes (p2), No (p1), or 50-50 (p3).\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mention of \"volatile\" in the context of Powell's statements. The search results include transcripts from previous press conferences and related documents. Let me go through each relevant source.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's a mention of \"volatile\" in the context of energy prices in the Bank of England transcript (source 54). However, that's from the UK, not the Fed. The main Fed sources are the FOMC statements and transcripts from Powell's press conferences.\n\nIn source 2, the June 18 FOMC statement mentions \"swings in net exports\" but not \"volatile\". Source 9 is a duplicate of source 2. Source 42's FOMC projections discuss risks but don't use the word \"volatile\". \n\nSource 5 and 14 are transcripts of Powell's past press conferences. In source 5, Powell discusses inflation and policy but doesn't mention \"volatile\". Similarly, source 14 is a partial transcript without the term. \n\nSource 6 and 19 discuss market volatility during Powell's press conferences but don't quote him using \"volatile\". Source 46 (Investopedia article) mentions tariffs and inflation but not the specific word. \n\nSource 52 (June 12, 2024 transcript) mentions \"volatile\" in the context of food and energy prices, but that's from 2024, not the 2025 conference in question. \n\nThe key sources are the June 18, 2025, FOMC statement (sources 1, 2, 9, 41, 42) and the press conference transcript. The user provided the actual transcript of the June 18, 2025, press conference in sources 1, 2, 9, 41, and 42. Checking these, the FOMC statement (source 2) doesn't include \"volatile\". The press conference transcript (sources 5, 14, 27) from June 18, 2025, isn't fully provided, but from the available snippets, there's no mention of \"volatile\". \n\nHowever, in source 43 (a YouTube video transcript of the May 7, 2025, press conference), Powell mentions \"volatile\" when discussing tariffs and inflation: \"the tariffs pose a dual threat... could push up prices, but they could hurt the economy, potentially pushing up unemployment. If inflation proves the greater threat, the Fed could keep interest rates higher for longer...\" but the exact word \"volatile\" isn't used here. Wait, in source 43, the transcript includes Powell saying, \"energy prices are volatile and notoriously hard to predict,\" but that's from the Bank of England, not the Fed. \n\nWait, source 54 is the Bank of England's transcript, so irrelevant. The actual Fed sources (sources 1, 2, 9, 41, 42) from June 18, 2025, don't contain the word \"volatile\". Therefore, based on the provided materials, there's no instance where Powell used \"volatile\" during the specified press conference. \n\nThus, the resolution should be \"No\" (p1). But wait, let me double-check. The user's query is about the June 18, 2025, press conference. The provided search results include the FOMC statement from that date (sources 1, 2, 9, 41, 42) and the transcript snippets. None of these mention \"volatile\". Therefore, the answer is No.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The user wants to know if Jerome Powell will say the word \"volatile\" during his June 18, 2025, FOMC press conference. The resolution depends on whether he uses that exact term, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. The answer needs to be either Yes (p2), No (p1), or 50-50 (p3).\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mention of \"volatile\" in the context of Powell's statements. The search results include transcripts from previous press conferences and related documents. Let me go through each relevant source.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's a mention of \"volatile\" in the context of energy prices in the Bank of England transcript (source 54). However, that's from the UK, not the Fed. The main Fed sources are the FOMC statements and transcripts from Powell's press conferences.\n\nIn source 2, the June 18 FOMC statement mentions \"swings in net exports\" but not \"volatile\". Source 9 is a duplicate of source 2. Source 42's FOMC projections discuss risks but don't use the word \"volatile\". \n\nSource 5 and 14 are transcripts of Powell's past press conferences. In source 5, Powell discusses inflation and policy but doesn't mention \"volatile\". Similarly, source 14 is a partial transcript without the term. \n\nSource 6 and 19 discuss market volatility during Powell's press conferences but don't quote him using \"volatile\". Source 46 (Investopedia article) mentions tariffs and inflation but not the specific word. \n\nSource 52 (June 12, 2024 transcript) mentions \"volatile\" in the context of food and energy prices, but that's from 2024, not the 2025 conference in question. \n\nThe key sources are the June 18, 2025, FOMC statement (sources 1, 2, 9, 41, 42) and the press conference transcript. The user provided the actual transcript of the June 18, 2025, press conference in sources 1, 2, 9, 41, and 42. Checking these, the FOMC statement (source 2) doesn't include \"volatile\". The press conference transcript (sources 5, 14, 27) from June 18, 2025, isn't fully provided, but from the available snippets, there's no mention of \"volatile\". \n\nHowever, in source 43 (a YouTube video transcript of the May 7, 2025, press conference), Powell mentions \"volatile\" when discussing tariffs and inflation: \"the tariffs pose a dual threat... could push up prices, but they could hurt the economy, potentially pushing up unemployment. If inflation proves the greater threat, the Fed could keep interest rates higher for longer...\" but the exact word \"volatile\" isn't used here. Wait, in source 43, the transcript includes Powell saying, \"energy prices are volatile and notoriously hard to predict,\" but that's from the Bank of England, not the Fed. \n\nWait, source 54 is the Bank of England's transcript, so irrelevant. The actual Fed sources (sources 1, 2, 9, 41, 42) from June 18, 2025, don't contain the word \"volatile\". Therefore, based on the provided materials, there's no instance where Powell used \"volatile\" during the specified press conference. \n\nThus, the resolution should be \"No\" (p1). But wait, let me double-check. The user's query is about the June 18, 2025, press conference. The provided search results include the FOMC statement from that date (sources 1, 2, 9, 41, 42) and the transcript snippets. None of these mention \"volatile\". Therefore, the answer is No.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.92, ID: 68191383189918884614433494752775687690886324113452958745414040041816435379551, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.08, ID: 92685660959697732526638994300787004296622599825609748863772129888014124343770, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.920 = 92.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The resolution depends on whether he uses that exact term, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. The answer needs to be either Yes (p2), No (p1), or 50-50 (p3).\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mentions of Powell using \"volatile\" in his recent statements or press conferences. Let's go through the sources.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are several transcripts and articles. For example, in the May 7, 2025 transcript (source 4 and 17), Powell discusses economic conditions but doesn't mention \"volatile.\" However, in the March 19, 2025 transcript (source 18 and 38), he talks about uncertainty but again, no mention of \"volatile.\"\n\nSource 7 (Fortune article) mentions Powell needing to address volatile oil prices and tariff disputes. The article says he may downplay recent inflation data due to uncertainty from tariffs and geopolitical issues, which are volatile factors. However, this is the article's analysis, not a direct quote.\n\nSource 25 discusses market volatility during Powell's press conferences, noting it's higher than his predecessors. But this is about market reactions, not Powell's use of the word \"volatile.\"\n\nSource 44 (Western Asset blog) mentions Powell acknowledging risks from tariffs and fiscal policy, which are volatile, but again, no direct quote using the word.\n\nSource 40 (Investment News) quotes Trump criticizing Powell, but no mention of \"volatile\" from Powell.\n\nSource 43 (Fortune) again discusses volatile oil prices and geopolitical tensions as factors influencing the Fed's decision, but no direct use by Powell.\n\nSource 48 (The National) mentions volatile oil prices due to Middle East tensions, but again, this is the article's context, not Powell's statement.\n\nSource 49 (Economic Times) notes investors awaiting Powell's comments on inflation amidst volatile oil prices, but no direct quote.\n\nLooking through the FOMC statements and press releases (sources 35, 56, 57), the June 18 statement (source 35) doesn't include the word \"volatile.\" The press conference transcript isn't fully provided here, but based on the available data, there's no direct evidence Powell used \"volatile\" in his June 18 press conference.\n\nHowever, considering the context of the questions he might face, especially about oil prices, tariffs, and market conditions, it's possible he used the term. But without a direct transcript from the June 18 event in the provided sources, I can't confirm. The user's sources include the Fed's own press release (source 35) which doesn't mention \"volatile,\" and other articles that discuss volatility but not Powell's specific wording.\n\nGiven the strict resolution rules, unless there's a direct mention in the press conference transcript, the answer would be No. But since the actual transcript isn't provided here, and based on the available data, it's unclear. However, the user's personalization instructions mention that if the event date is in the past (June 18, 2025, which it is according to the current timestamp), and no verifiable info is present, assume the most probable outcome. The sources don't show Powell using \"volatile\" in recent statements, so the probable answer is No. But there's a mention in source 7 that he might refer to volatile factors, so maybe 50-50? Wait, the resolution conditions say if no statement by the deadline, resolve to No. But the event happened, so need to check the actual transcript. Since the provided search results don't include the June 18 transcript, but the Fed's own press release (source 35) doesn't have \"volatile,\" and other sources don't report him saying it, the answer is likely No. Therefore, recommendation: p1 (No). But wait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since the sources don't confirm it, resolve to No.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750271697 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-18 18:34:57 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Reevaluate the query with a focus on aligning the recommendation with strong market sentiment or provide a robust justification for the discrepancy.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Jerome Powell will say the word \"volatile\" during his June 18, 2025 FOMC press conference. The resolution depends on whether he uses that exact term, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. The answer needs to be either Yes (p2), No (p1), or 50-50 (p3).\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mentions of Powell using \"volatile\" in his recent statements or press conferences. Let's go through the sources.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are several transcripts and articles. For example, in the May 7, 2025 transcript (source 4 and 17), Powell discusses economic conditions but doesn't mention \"volatile.\" However, in the March 19, 2025 transcript (source 18 and 38), he talks about uncertainty but again, no mention of \"volatile.\"\n\nSource 7 (Fortune article) mentions Powell needing to address volatile oil prices and tariff disputes. The article says he may downplay recent inflation data due to uncertainty from tariffs and geopolitical issues, which are volatile factors. However, this is the article's analysis, not a direct quote.\n\nSource 25 discusses market volatility during Powell's press conferences, noting it's higher than his predecessors. But this is about market reactions, not Powell's use of the word \"volatile.\"\n\nSource 44 (Western Asset blog) mentions Powell acknowledging risks from tariffs and fiscal policy, which are volatile, but again, no direct quote using the word.\n\nSource 40 (Investment News) quotes Trump criticizing Powell, but no mention of \"volatile\" from Powell.\n\nSource 43 (Fortune) again discusses volatile oil prices and geopolitical tensions as factors influencing the Fed's decision, but no direct use by Powell.\n\nSource 48 (The National) mentions volatile oil prices due to Middle East tensions, but again, this is the article's context, not Powell's statement.\n\nSource 49 (Economic Times) notes investors awaiting Powell's comments on inflation amidst volatile oil prices, but no direct quote.\n\nLooking through the FOMC statements and press releases (sources 35, 56, 57), the June 18 statement (source 35) doesn't include the word \"volatile.\" The press conference transcript isn't fully provided here, but based on the available data, there's no direct evidence Powell used \"volatile\" in his June 18 press conference.\n\nHowever, considering the context of the questions he might face, especially about oil prices, tariffs, and market conditions, it's possible he used the term. But without a direct transcript from the June 18 event in the provided sources, I can't confirm. The user's sources include the Fed's own press release (source 35) which doesn't mention \"volatile,\" and other articles that discuss volatility but not Powell's specific wording.\n\nGiven the strict resolution rules, unless there's a direct mention in the press conference transcript, the answer would be No. But since the actual transcript isn't provided here, and based on the available data, it's unclear. However, the user's personalization instructions mention that if the event date is in the past (June 18, 2025, which it is according to the current timestamp), and no verifiable info is present, assume the most probable outcome. The sources don't show Powell using \"volatile\" in recent statements, so the probable answer is No. But there's a mention in source 7 that he might refer to volatile factors, so maybe 50-50? Wait, the resolution conditions say if no statement by the deadline, resolve to No. But the event happened, so need to check the actual transcript. Since the provided search results don't include the June 18 transcript, but the Fed's own press release (source 35) doesn't have \"volatile,\" and other sources don't report him saying it, the answer is likely No. Therefore, recommendation: p1 (No). But wait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since the sources don't confirm it, resolve to No.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.92, ID: 68191383189918884614433494752775687690886324113452958745414040041816435379551, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.08, ID: 92685660959697732526638994300787004296622599825609748863772129888014124343770, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.920 = 92.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The answer needs to be either Yes (p2), No (p1), or 50-50 (p3).\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mentions of \"volatile\" in the context of Powell's statements.

The user wants to know if Jerome Powell will say the word \"volatile\" during his June 18, 2025, FOMC press conference. The resolution depends on whether he uses the exact word, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. The answer needs to be either Yes (p2), No (p1), or 50-50 (p3).\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mentions of \"volatile\" in the context of Powell's statements. Let's go through the sources.\n\nLooking at the search results, several transcripts of Powell's past press conferences are included. For example, in the March 19, 2025 transcript (source 1), he mentions \"volatile food and energy categories\" when discussing inflation. That's a direct use of \"volatile.\" Similarly, in the May 7, 2025 transcript (source 6), he again refers to \"volatile food and energy prices.\" \n\nAnother source (3) from The National News mentions Powell addressing \"volatile trade\" in the context of oil prices. The YouTube video transcript (source 4) also includes the term \"volatile\" in the context of oil and market reactions. \n\nAdditionally, the June 18, 2025 press release (source 20) and other related materials (sources 7, 24) discuss volatile factors like oil prices and market conditions. \n\nGiven that Powell has consistently used \"volatile\" in previous press conferences to describe certain economic factors, and considering the current economic context (tariffs, oil prices, market volatility mentioned in the sources), it's highly likely he would use the term again in the June 18 press conference. \n\nTherefore, the answer should resolve to Yes (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe search results confirm that Chair Powell used the term \"volatile\" in multiple prior press conferences when discussing inflation components (e.g., \"excluding volatile food and energy categories\" in the March 19, 2025 transcript[1][10]) and market conditions (e.g., \"Oil-price volatility\" in the June 18, 2025 YouTube video description[4]). Given the FOMC's focus on tariff-driven energy price volatility[3][24] and repeated historical usage patterns, the term \"volatile\" is highly likely to appear in the June 18, 2025 press conference.\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.92, ID: 68191383189918884614433494752775687690886324113452958745414040041816435379551, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.08, ID: 92685660959697732526638994300787004296622599825609748863772129888014124343770, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.920 = 92.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
