      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Jerome Powell said the word \"Degree\" three or more times during his Princeton Commencement address on May 25, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the event details. The search results indicate that Powell was the Baccalaureate speaker, not the Commencement speaker. The Baccalaureate was on May 25 at 2 p.m., and the Commencement is on May 27. The user's query mentions the Commencement on May 25, but according to the sources, that's incorrect. The Baccalaureate was on the 25th, and Commencement is on the 27th. This discrepancy is crucial because the market's resolution depends on the specific event.\n\nNext, I need to check the transcript of Powell's Baccalaureate speech provided in search result [1]. The user's ancillary data mentions the Commencement address, but the actual event Powell spoke at was the Baccalaureate. The user might have confused the two events. However, the resolution conditions state that the market is about the main speech at the named event, which in the query is the Commencement. But according to the sources, Powell spoke at the Baccalaureate, not Commencement. If the event named in the query is incorrect, that could affect the resolution.\n\nAssuming the user intended the Baccalaureate (since that's where Powell spoke), I need to analyze the speech transcript. The transcript in [1] shows Powell's remarks. I'll scan through it for the word \"degree\" in any form. \n\nLooking at the transcript:\n- He starts by congratulating the class on \"earning your degree.\" That's one instance.\n- Later, he mentions his own bachelor\u2019s degree in politics from Princeton. That's a second instance.\n- Are there any other mentions? The rest of the speech talks about service, democracy, and personal integrity. No other uses of \"degree\" or its plural/possessive forms. \n\nSo, only two instances of \"degree.\" The market requires three or more for \"Yes.\" Therefore, the answer should be \"No.\" Additionally, the event date in the query is May 25, which is the Baccalaureate, not the Commencement. If the market is strictly about the Commencement (May 27), then Powell didn't speak there, so the answer is \"No\" because the event didn't occur as named. However, if the user made a mistake and meant the Baccalaureate, the count is still two, leading to \"No.\" Either way, the resolution is \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1748200689 Current Date and Time: 2025-05-25 19:18:09 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Jerome Powell said the word \"Degree\" three or more times during his Princeton Commencement address on May 25, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the event details. The search results indicate that Powell was the Baccalaureate speaker, not the Commencement speaker. The Baccalaureate was on May 25 at 2 p.m., and the Commencement is on May 27. The user's query mentions the Commencement on May 25, but according to the sources, that's incorrect. The Baccalaureate was on the 25th, and Commencement is on the 27th. This discrepancy is crucial because the market's resolution depends on the specific event.\n\nNext, I need to check the transcript of Powell's Baccalaureate speech provided in search result [1]. The user's ancillary data mentions the Commencement address, but the actual event Powell spoke at was the Baccalaureate. The user might have confused the two events. However, the resolution conditions state that the market is about the main speech at the named event, which in the query is the Commencement. But according to the sources, Powell spoke at the Baccalaureate, not Commencement. If the event named in the query is incorrect, that could affect the resolution.\n\nAssuming the user intended the Baccalaureate (since that's where Powell spoke), I need to analyze the speech transcript. The transcript in [1] shows Powell's remarks. I'll scan through it for the word \"degree\" in any form. \n\nLooking at the transcript:\n- He starts by congratulating the class on \"earning your degree.\" That's one instance.\n- Later, he mentions his own bachelor\u2019s degree in politics from Princeton. That's a second instance.\n- Are there any other mentions? The rest of the speech talks about service, democracy, and personal integrity. No other uses of \"degree\" or its plural/possessive forms. \n\nSo, only two instances of \"degree.\" The market requires three or more for \"Yes.\" Therefore, the answer should be \"No.\" Additionally, the event date in the query is May 25, which is the Baccalaureate, not the Commencement. If the market is strictly about the Commencement (May 27), then Powell didn't speak there, so the answer is \"No\" because the event didn't occur as named. However, if the user made a mistake and meant the Baccalaureate, the count is still two, leading to \"No.\" Either way, the resolution is \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.095, ID: 104358982080926125134715789056203074559708161340513920954292496680100656553170, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.905, ID: 9786641253929734854934408271492929475789778221616335364309892841887848062523, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (0.905 = 90.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
