The resolution depends on kinetic military strikes, not cyber attacks. I need to check the provided search results for any mentions of such strikes.\n\nLooking at the search results, most of them discuss Israeli strikes on nuclear facilities and military targets. For example, result [1] mentions attacks on nuclear sites and military installations but doesn't mention oil infrastructure. Result [2] talks about a strike near the Tabriz Refinery, but result [7] and [18] state that the Tabriz refinery wasn't damaged. Result [13] and [16] explicitly mention that Iran's oil infrastructure, including refineries, remained untouched. \n\nThere's a contradiction between some sources. For instance, result [2] and [18] report a strike near Tabriz refinery, but Iranian officials deny any damage. The resolution conditions say credible reporting consensus is needed. Since multiple sources, including Iranian state media and international reports, confirm no damage to oil facilities, it's likely the strike near Tabriz didn't hit the refinery. Also, the main focus of Israel's operation was nuclear and military targets, not oil. \n\nTherefore, based on the majority of sources indicating no damage to oil infrastructure, the answer should resolve to \"No\" (p1).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The user wants to know if Israel struck Iranian oil or gas infrastructure between June 11 and June 30, 2025. The resolution depends on kinetic military strikes, not cyber attacks. I need to check the provided search results for any mentions of such strikes.\n\nLooking at the search results, most of them discuss Israeli strikes on nuclear facilities and military targets. For example, result [1] mentions attacks on nuclear sites and military installations but doesn't mention oil infrastructure. Result [2] talks about a strike near the Tabriz Refinery, but result [7] and [18] state that the Tabriz refinery wasn't damaged. Result [13] and [16] explicitly mention that Iran's oil infrastructure, including refineries, remained untouched. \n\nThere's a contradiction between some sources. For instance, result [2] and [18] report a strike near Tabriz refinery, but Iranian officials deny any damage. The resolution conditions say credible reporting consensus is needed. Since multiple sources, including Iranian state media and international reports, confirm no damage to oil facilities, it's likely the strike near Tabriz didn't hit the refinery. Also, the main focus of Israel's operation was nuclear and military targets, not oil. \n\nTherefore, based on the majority of sources indicating no damage to oil infrastructure, the answer should resolve to \"No\" (p1).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.994, ID: 62556363475865305599969880627502541320760109857193673168219333874359126714617, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.006, ID: 109107426095798083207216873928038031767572688999843860565139423676606081238777, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.994 = 99.4% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Israel struck Iranian oil or gas facilities between June 11 and June 30, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if there's a kinetic military strike on such infrastructure, excluding cyber attacks. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. Let's go through each one to see if any mention attacks on oil facilities. \n\nSearch result [1] talks about Israeli strikes on nuclear facilities and military targets, but not specifically oil. [2] and [12] discuss oil prices spiking due to the strikes but note that Iranian oil infrastructure wasn't damaged. [3] mentions a strike near the Tabriz Refinery, with smoke reported. [13] and [14] also mention Tabriz Refinery being targeted but Iranian sources deny damage. [15] and [16] have conflicting reports: some say the refinery was hit, others say it's operational. \n\nThe key here is whether the strike was on oil infrastructure. The Tabriz Refinery is an oil facility. Even if the attack was near it and caused smoke, if it's confirmed as a target, that counts. However, Iranian sources claim no damage and the refinery is working. But the market condition includes strikes on infrastructure regardless of damage, as long as it's a kinetic attack. \n\nThe resolution sources are official statements or credible reports. The Israeli government hasn't explicitly stated targeting oil facilities, but some reports (like [3], [15]) mention strikes near the refinery. However, [16] states Iran's oil infrastructure was untouched. \n\nThere's conflicting information. Some sources report attacks near oil facilities, others deny damage. The market requires a consensus. If credible reports confirm the strike on the refinery, even if denied by Iran, it might still count. But without clear evidence, it's ambiguous. \n\nGiven the ancillary data, the answer should be based on whether the strike was on oil infrastructure. The Tabriz Refinery was targeted, but the extent is unclear. Since the market includes attempts (as long as they're kinetic), but the user note says strikes shot down or missed don't count. If the drone was intercepted, it might not count. However, [15] mentions smoke, implying some impact. \n\nConsidering all, there's evidence of an attempt on the Tabriz Refinery, but conflicting reports on success. Without clear confirmation, it's uncertain. However, the presence of multiple reports suggesting the refinery was a target might lean towards \"Yes\". But since the refinery is reported operational, maybe the strike missed. \n\nWait, the user note says strikes that are shot down or miss don't count. So if the drone was intercepted, it doesn't count. [14] says drones were shot down. [15] mentions smoke but also that the refinery is working. So maybe the strike was intercepted, causing smoke but no damage. In that case, it doesn't count. \n\nBut the market says \"kinetic military strike\" regardless of success. Wait, no: the note says \"strikes which are shot down or miss their targets will not be considered\". So only successful strikes count. If the drone was intercepted, it's not considered. \n\nSo if the Tabriz strike was intercepted, it doesn't count. But some reports say the refinery was hit. Conflicting info. The resolution sources are official statements or credible reports. If credible reports (like [3], [15]) say it was hit, even if Iran denies, then it's a \"Yes\". But others say no damage. \n\nThis is a close call. The consensus of credible reporting is needed. Since there's conflicting info, but some sources (Jerusalem Post in [15]) report the strike, it might be considered a \"Yes\". However, the refinery's operator denies damage. Without clear evidence, it's safer to go with \"No\" unless confirmed. \n\nBut the market resolution uses credible reporting. If multiple sources report the strike, even if denied, it might still resolve to \"Yes\". However, the user instruction says to resolve based on verified facts. If the strike happened but didn't damage, does it count? The market says \"kinetic military strike against\" the facility. So even if intercepted, if the intent was to strike, but it was shot down, it doesn't count. If the strike hit but caused no damage, does it count? The note says strikes that miss or are shot down don't count. So only successful strikes. \n\nIf the refinery was hit but not damaged, it's still a strike. But the note says \"miss\" or \"shot down\" don't count. So if the strike hit the facility, even without damage, it counts. But if it was near and didn't hit, it doesn't. \n\nIn [3], the strike is near the refinery, smoke reported. [15] says the refinery was hit. [16] says oil infrastructure untouched. So conflicting. The consensus might be that there was an attempt but no successful strike. Hence, resolve to \"No\". \n\nBut the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. Here, the event is between June 11-30, 2025. The current date is June 14, 2025. The strikes on Tabriz were on June 14. So the event is in the window. \n\nIf the strike on Tabriz refinery is confirmed, even if no damage, it's a \"Yes\". But the note requires it to be a kinetic strike on the facility. If the strike was near but not on the facility, it doesn't count. The reports are mixed. Some say near, some say hit. \n\nGiven the conflicting reports, and the need for verified facts, if there's no clear evidence of a successful strike on oil infrastructure, the resolution would be \"No\". However, some sources (like [15]) claim a hit. Without official confirmation, but with credible reports, it's a tough call. \n\nIn such cases, the ancillary data says to use consensus of credible reporting. If multiple credible sources report the strike, even if denied by Iran, it might resolve to \"Yes\". But if the consensus is unclear, maybe \"p3\" (unknown). However, the resolution conditions have p3 as 0.5, but the user might want a definitive answer. \n\nGiven the evidence, there's a report of a strike near the Tabriz refinery with smoke, but the refinery claims no damage. The market requires a strike on the facility. If the attack was near but not on the facility, it doesn't count. If it was on the facility, even without damage, it does. \n\nSince the reports are conflicting, and the user instruction says to resolve based on verified facts, and the refinery's operator says no damage, it's possible the strike didn't hit the facility. Hence, resolve to \"No\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The user wants to know if Israel struck Iranian oil or gas facilities between June 11 and June 30, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if there's a kinetic military strike on such infrastructure, excluding cyber attacks. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. Let's go through each one to see if any mention attacks on oil facilities. \n\nSearch result [1] talks about Israeli strikes on nuclear facilities and military targets, but not specifically oil. [2] and [12] discuss oil prices spiking due to the strikes but note that Iranian oil infrastructure wasn't damaged. [3] mentions a strike near the Tabriz Refinery, with smoke reported. [13] and [14] also mention Tabriz Refinery being targeted but Iranian sources deny damage. [15] and [16] have conflicting reports: some say the refinery was hit, others say it's operational. \n\nThe key here is whether the strike was on oil infrastructure. The Tabriz Refinery is an oil facility. Even if the attack was near it and caused smoke, if it's confirmed as a target, that counts. However, Iranian sources claim no damage and the refinery is working. But the market condition includes strikes on infrastructure regardless of damage, as long as it's a kinetic attack. \n\nThe resolution sources are official statements or credible reports. The Israeli government hasn't explicitly stated targeting oil facilities, but some reports (like [3], [15]) mention strikes near the refinery. However, [16] states Iran's oil infrastructure was untouched. \n\nThere's conflicting information. Some sources report attacks near oil facilities, others deny damage. The market requires a consensus. If credible reports confirm the strike on the refinery, even if denied by Iran, it might still count. But without clear evidence, it's ambiguous. \n\nGiven the ancillary data, the answer should be based on whether the strike was on oil infrastructure. The Tabriz Refinery was targeted, but the extent is unclear. Since the market includes attempts (as long as they're kinetic), but the user note says strikes shot down or missed don't count. If the drone was intercepted, it might not count. However, [15] mentions smoke, implying some impact. \n\nConsidering all, there's evidence of an attempt on the Tabriz Refinery, but conflicting reports on success. Without clear confirmation, it's uncertain. However, the presence of multiple reports suggesting the refinery was a target might lean towards \"Yes\". But since the refinery is reported operational, maybe the strike missed. \n\nWait, the user note says strikes that are shot down or miss don't count. So if the drone was intercepted, it doesn't count. [14] says drones were shot down. [15] mentions smoke but also that the refinery is working. So maybe the strike was intercepted, causing smoke but no damage. In that case, it doesn't count. \n\nBut the market says \"kinetic military strike\" regardless of success. Wait, no: the note says \"strikes which are shot down or miss their targets will not be considered\". So only successful strikes count. If the drone was intercepted, it's not considered. \n\nSo if the Tabriz strike was intercepted, it doesn't count. But some reports say the refinery was hit. Conflicting info. The resolution sources are official statements or credible reports. If credible reports (like [3], [15]) say it was hit, even if Iran denies, then it's a \"Yes\". But others say no damage. \n\nThis is a close call. The consensus of credible reporting is needed. Since there's conflicting info, but some sources (Jerusalem Post in [15]) report the strike, it might be considered a \"Yes\". However, the refinery's operator denies damage. Without clear evidence, it's safer to go with \"No\" unless confirmed. \n\nBut the market resolution uses credible reporting. If multiple sources report the strike, even if denied, it might still resolve to \"Yes\". However, the user instruction says to resolve based on verified facts. If the strike happened but didn't damage, does it count? The market says \"kinetic military strike against\" the facility. So even if intercepted, if the intent was to strike, but it was shot down, it doesn't count. If the strike hit but caused no damage, does it count? The note says strikes that miss or are shot down don't count. So only successful strikes. \n\nIf the refinery was hit but not damaged, it's still a strike. But the note says \"miss\" or \"shot down\" don't count. So if the strike hit the facility, even without damage, it counts. But if it was near and didn't hit, it doesn't. \n\nIn [3], the strike is near the refinery, smoke reported. [15] says the refinery was hit. [16] says oil infrastructure untouched. So conflicting. The consensus might be that there was an attempt but no successful strike. Hence, resolve to \"No\". \n\nBut the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. Here, the event is between June 11-30, 2025. The current date is June 14, 2025. The strikes on Tabriz were on June 14. So the event is in the window. \n\nIf the strike on Tabriz refinery is confirmed, even if no damage, it's a \"Yes\". But the note requires it to be a kinetic strike on the facility. If the strike was near but not on the facility, it doesn't count. The reports are mixed. Some say near, some say hit. \n\nGiven the conflicting reports, and the need for verified facts, if there's no clear evidence of a successful strike on oil infrastructure, the resolution would be \"No\". However, some sources (like [15]) claim a hit. Without official confirmation, but with credible reports, it's a tough call. \n\nIn such cases, the ancillary data says to use consensus of credible reporting. If multiple credible sources report the strike, even if denied by Iran, it might resolve to \"Yes\". But if the consensus is unclear, maybe \"p3\" (unknown). However, the resolution conditions have p3 as 0.5, but the user might want a definitive answer. \n\nGiven the evidence, there's a report of a strike near the Tabriz refinery with smoke, but the refinery claims no damage. The market requires a strike on the facility. If the attack was near but not on the facility, it doesn't count. If it was on the facility, even without damage, it does. \n\nSince the reports are conflicting, and the user instruction says to resolve based on verified facts, and the refinery's operator says no damage, it's possible the strike didn't hit the facility. Hence, resolve to \"No\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.994, ID: 62556363475865305599969880627502541320760109857193673168219333874359126714617, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.006, ID: 109107426095798083207216873928038031767572688999843860565139423676606081238777, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.994 = 99.4% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Israel struck Iranian oil or gas infrastructure between June 11 and June 30, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if there's a kinetic military strike on such facilities, excluding cyber attacks. The resolution sources are official statements or credible reports.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. Let's go through each one to see if any mention attacks on oil or gas facilities.\n\nLooking at result [1], it's about Israeli strikes on nuclear and military sites in Iran. No mention of oil infrastructure. Result [2] also discusses nuclear targets and military leaders, not oil. Result [3] from ISIS online focuses on nuclear facilities, specifically Natanz. Again, no oil here.\n\nResult [4] from Caliber.az mentions an Israeli strike on the Tabriz oil refinery on June 14. Eyewitnesses report smoke, but Iranian state media confirms the attack. However, result [13] from Ainvest states that the National Iranian Oil Company denied any damage to the Tabriz refinery. Result [14] from Reuters via TradingView says Mehr News reported a strike near Tabriz refinery with smoke, but the refinery denied being hit. Result [15] from Dawn.com also mentions the Tabriz refinery denying damage.\n\nSo there's conflicting information. Some sources report strikes near the refinery, while others deny it. The key is whether the strike actually hit the oil infrastructure. The user's query specifies that strikes must hit the target; intercepted or missed ones don't count. If the refinery wasn't damaged, then it doesn't qualify. But if there was a kinetic strike on the facility, even if damage is denied, credible reports could still count.\n\nResult [12] from Argus Media states that Iran's oil infrastructure was untouched by the initial strikes on June 13. However, result [4] and [14] suggest a strike on June 14 near Tabriz. The refinery's denial in [13] and [14] complicates things. The user's resolution conditions allow for credible reporting consensus even if official statements conflict.\n\nThe consensus from multiple sources (Caliber.az, TradingView) reports the strike near Tabriz refinery with observable effects (smoke), but the refinery denies damage. However, the market's condition includes any kinetic action against the infrastructure. Even if the strike was near and caused smoke, if it's part of the oil facility, it might count. But if the refinery wasn't actually hit, then it's a miss.\n\nGiven the conflicting reports, I need to determine if there's enough credible evidence. The user's note says intercepted strikes don't count. If the strike was near but didn't hit the refinery, it's a miss. However, if the strike was on the refinery and the denial is propaganda, then it's a yes. \n\nThe search results don't provide clear evidence of direct hits on oil infrastructure. The Tabriz refinery was reportedly targeted, but damage is denied. Without conclusive evidence from credible sources confirming the strike hit the oil facility, it's uncertain. However, the market resolution allows for consensus of credible reporting. If multiple sources report the strike on the refinery, even with denials, it might lean towards yes. But given the denials and lack of confirmed damage, it's more likely a no. \n\nWait, result [4] says Iranian state media confirmed the attack on Tabriz refinery, but [13] and [14] have the refinery denying it. This contradiction needs resolving. The user's resolution conditions consider official statements and credible reports. If Iranian state media confirmed the attack, that's an official source. But later, the refinery denied it. Which is more reliable? The initial confirmation might have been incorrect, or the denial could be propaganda. \n\nAlternatively, the strike might have been near the refinery but not directly hitting it. The user's query includes strikes on oil infrastructure, so if the attack was nearby but not on the facility, it doesn't count. The refinery's denial suggests it wasn't hit. Therefore, despite some reports, the consensus might not confirm a direct strike. \n\nThus, the answer is likely \"No\" (p1), as there's no confirmed kinetic strike on Iranian oil infrastructure within the timeframe. The conflicting reports and denials mean there's insufficient evidence to resolve as \"Yes.\"\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The user wants to know if Israel struck Iranian oil or gas infrastructure between June 11 and June 30, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if there's a kinetic military strike on such facilities, excluding cyber attacks. The resolution sources are official statements or credible reports.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. Let's go through each one to see if any mention attacks on oil or gas facilities.\n\nLooking at result [1], it's about Israeli strikes on nuclear and military sites in Iran. No mention of oil infrastructure. Result [2] also discusses nuclear targets and military leaders, not oil. Result [3] from ISIS online focuses on nuclear facilities, specifically Natanz. Again, no oil here.\n\nResult [4] from Caliber.az mentions an Israeli strike on the Tabriz oil refinery on June 14. Eyewitnesses report smoke, but Iranian state media confirms the attack. However, result [13] from Ainvest states that the National Iranian Oil Company denied any damage to the Tabriz refinery. Result [14] from Reuters via TradingView says Mehr News reported a strike near Tabriz refinery with smoke, but the refinery denied being hit. Result [15] from Dawn.com also mentions the Tabriz refinery denying damage.\n\nSo there's conflicting information. Some sources report strikes near the refinery, while others deny it. The key is whether the strike actually hit the oil infrastructure. The user's query specifies that strikes must hit the target; intercepted or missed ones don't count. If the refinery wasn't damaged, then it doesn't qualify. But if there was a kinetic strike on the facility, even if damage is denied, credible reports could still count.\n\nResult [12] from Argus Media states that Iran's oil infrastructure was untouched by the initial strikes on June 13. However, result [4] and [14] suggest a strike on June 14 near Tabriz. The refinery's denial in [13] and [14] complicates things. The user's resolution conditions allow for credible reporting consensus even if official statements conflict.\n\nThe consensus from multiple sources (Caliber.az, TradingView) reports the strike near Tabriz refinery with observable effects (smoke), but the refinery denies damage. However, the market's condition includes any kinetic action against the infrastructure. Even if the strike was near and caused smoke, if it's part of the oil facility, it might count. But if the refinery wasn't actually hit, then it's a miss.\n\nGiven the conflicting reports, I need to determine if there's enough credible evidence. The user's note says intercepted strikes don't count. If the strike was near but didn't hit the refinery, it's a miss. However, if the strike was on the refinery and the denial is propaganda, then it's a yes. \n\nThe search results don't provide clear evidence of direct hits on oil infrastructure. The Tabriz refinery was reportedly targeted, but damage is denied. Without conclusive evidence from credible sources confirming the strike hit the oil facility, it's uncertain. However, the market resolution allows for consensus of credible reporting. If multiple sources report the strike on the refinery, even with denials, it might lean towards yes. But given the denials and lack of confirmed damage, it's more likely a no. \n\nWait, result [4] says Iranian state media confirmed the attack on Tabriz refinery, but [13] and [14] have the refinery denying it. This contradiction needs resolving. The user's resolution conditions consider official statements and credible reports. If Iranian state media confirmed the attack, that's an official source. But later, the refinery denied it. Which is more reliable? The initial confirmation might have been incorrect, or the denial could be propaganda. \n\nAlternatively, the strike might have been near the refinery but not directly hitting it. The user's query includes strikes on oil infrastructure, so if the attack was nearby but not on the facility, it doesn't count. The refinery's denial suggests it wasn't hit. Therefore, despite some reports, the consensus might not confirm a direct strike. \n\nThus, the answer is likely \"No\" (p1), as there's no confirmed kinetic strike on Iranian oil infrastructure within the timeframe. The conflicting reports and denials mean there's insufficient evidence to resolve as \"Yes.\"\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.994, ID: 62556363475865305599969880627502541320760109857193673168219333874359126714617, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.006, ID: 109107426095798083207216873928038031767572688999843860565139423676606081238777, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.994 = 99.4% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The user wants to know if the market should resolve to \"Yes\" because Israel struck Iranian oil or gas infrastructure between June 11 and June 30, 2025. The resolution depends on verified kinetic military strikes, not cyber attacks or other non-kinetic actions.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mentions of Israeli strikes on Iranian oil or gas facilities. Let's go through each source.\n\nLooking at source [1], it's about the Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear and military targets. It mentions strikes in Tabriz and Natanz, but these are nuclear facilities, not oil or gas. Source [2] talks about a strike near the Tabriz Refinery, but source [8] says the National Iranian Oil Company confirmed the Tabriz refinery wasn't damaged. Source [14] also mentions a strike near Tabriz refinery with smoke, but the refinery denied being hit. So conflicting reports here. Need to check credibility.\n\nSource [9] states Iran's oil infrastructure wasn't impacted. Source [13] from Argus Media confirms oil infrastructure was untouched. Source [15] and [16] mention strikes on the South Pars gas field, which is a shared Iran-Qatar field. The Iranian media reported fires after Israeli strikes there. However, South Pars is a gas field, so if it's considered part of Iran's gas infrastructure, that might count. But need to verify if it's on Iranian soil or maritime territory. South Pars is in Iranian waters, so yes.\n\nBut wait, source [15] says the Israeli Army bombed the 14th phase of South Pars, and source [16] reports fires after the strike. However, the Iranian media in source [18] also mentions the strike on South Pars. So there are credible reports of a strike on the South Pars gas field, which is Iranian gas infrastructure. Even if the refinery in Tabriz wasn't hit, the gas field was targeted. The market includes gas facilities, so this would qualify as a \"Yes\".\n\nBut need to confirm if the strike was kinetic. The sources mention airstrikes, which are kinetic. Also, the resolution conditions accept credible reporting. Even if the Iranian government denies damage, the strike itself occurred. The market resolution is based on the strike happening, not necessarily successful damage. However, the user's note says strikes that miss or are shot down don't count. So if the strike on South Pars was intercepted or missed, it wouldn't count. But sources [15], [16], and [18] report fires, implying the strike hit. Therefore, it's a valid kinetic strike on gas infrastructure.\n\nThus, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

South Pars is in Iranian waters, so yes.\n\nBut wait, source [15] says the Israeli Army bombed the 14th phase of South Pars, and source [16] reports fires after the strike. However, the Iranian media in source [18] also mentions the strike on South Pars. So there are credible reports of a strike on the South Pars gas field, which is Iranian gas infrastructure. Even if the refinery in Tabriz wasn't hit, the gas field was targeted. The market includes gas facilities, so this would qualify as a \"Yes\".\n\nBut need to confirm if the strike was kinetic. The sources mention airstrikes, which are kinetic. Also, the resolution conditions accept credible reporting. Even if the Iranian government denies damage, the strike itself occurred. The market resolution is based on the strike happening, not necessarily successful damage. However, the user's note says strikes that miss or are shot down don't count. So if the strike on South Pars was intercepted or missed, it wouldn't count. But sources [15], [16], and [18] report fires, implying the strike hit. Therefore, it's a valid kinetic strike on gas infrastructure.\n\nThus, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.994, ID: 62556363475865305599969880627502541320760109857193673168219333874359126714617, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.006, ID: 109107426095798083207216873928038031767572688999843860565139423676606081238777, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.994 = 99.4% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749916063 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-14 15:47:43 UTC",
