      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if May 2025 will be the hottest May on record according to the GISTEMP data. The resolution depends on the data from NASA's GLOBAL Land-Ocean Temperature Index. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The system says it's June 10, 2025. The data for May 2025 should have been released around the middle of June, right? Looking at the search results, there's a release schedule [41] indicating that the May data would be released on June 10, 2025. So today is the release date. \n\nNow, looking at the search results, there's a mention of the May 2025 data in [4] and [17], where users on prediction markets are discussing models and forecasts. They mention anomalies around 1.35\u00b0C, but these are predictions. However, the actual data from NASA's table is crucial here. \n\nIn the search results, [1] provides a snippet of the GISTEMP data table, but it only goes up to 1881. The latest data isn't shown in the provided snippets. However, the user provided a URL to the data source: https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/GLB.Ts+dSST.txt. Since the current date is June 10, 2025, the May 2025 data should be available there. \n\nBut wait, the search results include a note from [42] that the May 2025 data was released on June 10. However, in the provided context, there's no direct mention of the May 2025 value. The user's query is about whether May 2025 is the hottest, so I need to check the actual data. \n\nSince the system can't access live data, I have to rely on the provided context. The search results include a market prediction [59] where the resolution depends on the NASA data. Another result [65] from May 2024 shows a 12-month streak, but that's for 2023-2024. \n\nWait, there's a mention in [65] that each month from June 2023 to May 2024 set records, but that's the previous year. For May 2025, the key is whether it's higher than all previous Mays. The latest data in the context might be from [4], where a user mentions a predicted anomaly of 1.35\u00b0C for May 2025. If previous Mays had lower anomalies, then May 2025 would be the hottest. \n\nLooking at historical data, the highest May anomalies before 2025 would need to be checked. For example, in [66], May 2016 was the hottest at 0.93\u00b0C above the baseline. If May 2025's anomaly is higher, then it's a record. \n\nBut without the actual data point from the table, I have to infer. The user's ancillary data says to resolve based on the NASA table. Since the current date is June 10, 2025, and the data is released, but the provided search results don't include the actual May 2025 value, I might have to assume that the data isn't available yet in the context. However, the release date is today, so perhaps the data is available. \n\nWait, in the search results, [41] mentions the release date for May 2025 is June 10, 2025. Since the current timestamp is June 10, 2025, 15:27:03 UTC, the data should be out. However, the provided search results don't include the updated table with May 2025's value. \n\nGiven that, and the fact that the user instruction says to answer based on the provided search results, if the data isn't present, I should answer as per the instructions. But the search results do include [4] and [17], where users discuss models predicting higher temps, but no actual data. \n\nSince the data isn't present in the provided context, and the event date (May 2025) is in the past, but no verifiable outcome is provided, according to the personalization instructions, if no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The models in [4] suggest a higher anomaly, so likely \"Yes\". But the user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, resolve based on most probable outcome. \n\nHowever, the strict answer depends on whether the data is present. Since the data isn't in the context, but the release date is today, and the system's current time is after the release, but the data isn't shown, I might have to default to p4 (unknown). But the personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data defines p2 as Yes.

The user wants to know if May 2025 will be the hottest May on record according to the GISTEMP data. The resolution depends on the data from NASA's GLOBAL Land-Ocean Temperature Index. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The system says it's June 10, 2025. The data for May 2025 should have been released around the middle of June, right? Looking at the search results, there's a release schedule [41] indicating that the May data would be released on June 10, 2025. So today is the release date. \n\nNow, looking at the search results, there's a mention of the May 2025 data in [4] and [17], where users on prediction markets are discussing models and forecasts. They mention anomalies around 1.35\u00b0C, but these are predictions. However, the actual data from NASA's table is crucial here. \n\nIn the search results, [1] provides a snippet of the GISTEMP data table, but it only goes up to 1881. The latest data isn't shown in the provided snippets. However, the user provided a URL to the data source: https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/GLB.Ts+dSST.txt. Since the current date is June 10, 2025, the May 2025 data should be available there. \n\nBut wait, the search results include a note from [42] that the May 2025 data was released on June 10. However, in the provided context, there's no direct mention of the May 2025 value. The user's query is about whether May 2025 is the hottest, so I need to check the actual data. \n\nSince the system can't access live data, I have to rely on the provided context. The search results include a market prediction [59] where the resolution depends on the NASA data. Another result [65] from May 2024 shows a 12-month streak, but that's for 2023-2024. \n\nWait, there's a mention in [65] that each month from June 2023 to May 2024 set records, but that's the previous year. For May 2025, the key is whether it's higher than all previous Mays. The latest data in the context might be from [4], where a user mentions a predicted anomaly of 1.35\u00b0C for May 2025. If previous Mays had lower anomalies, then May 2025 would be the hottest. \n\nLooking at historical data, the highest May anomalies before 2025 would need to be checked. For example, in [66], May 2016 was the hottest at 0.93\u00b0C above the baseline. If May 2025's anomaly is higher, then it's a record. \n\nBut without the actual data point from the table, I have to infer. The user's ancillary data says to resolve based on the NASA table. Since the current date is June 10, 2025, and the data is released, but the provided search results don't include the actual May 2025 value, I might have to assume that the data isn't available yet in the context. However, the release date is today, so perhaps the data is available. \n\nWait, in the search results, [41] mentions the release date for May 2025 is June 10, 2025. Since the current timestamp is June 10, 2025, 15:27:03 UTC, the data should be out. However, the provided search results don't include the updated table with May 2025's value. \n\nGiven that, and the fact that the user instruction says to answer based on the provided search results, if the data isn't present, I should answer as per the instructions. But the search results do include [4] and [17], where users discuss models predicting higher temps, but no actual data. \n\nSince the data isn't present in the provided context, and the event date (May 2025) is in the past, but no verifiable outcome is provided, according to the personalization instructions, if no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The models in [4] suggest a higher anomaly, so likely \"Yes\". But the user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, resolve based on most probable outcome. \n\nHowever, the strict answer depends on whether the data is present. Since the data isn't in the context, but the release date is today, and the system's current time is after the release, but the data isn't shown, I might have to default to p4 (unknown). But the personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data defines p2 as Yes. If the models suggest it's likely, then resolve to p2. \n\nBut wait, the user's query is about the actual data. If the data isn't in the context, but the release date has passed, the system should check if the data is available. Since it's not in the provided search results, but the release was today, maybe the data is available now. However, without access to live data, I can't confirm. \n\nGiven the instructions, if the data isn't available in the provided context, answer as best as possible. The models in the search results suggest a higher temp, so the recommendation would be p2 (Yes). But I need to be careful. Alternatively, if the data isn't present, maybe the resolution is p4. But the personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nConsidering the provided context has discussions predicting higher temps, but no actual data, and the release date is today, I'll recommend p2 (Yes) as the most probable outcome based on the models mentioned.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.0045, ID: 82188983227180068597890455477121368894229182178615311247873898950610506427999, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.9955, ID: 56682163105289099372090505587636565390309132539441279751733113753536329345888, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if May 2025 was the hottest on record according to NASA's GISTEMP data. The resolution depends on the data from the GLB.Ts+dSST.txt table, specifically the May column. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for the latest May data. Looking at the search results, the most recent data in the GLOBAL Land-Ocean Temperature Index (from source [1]) goes up to 2019, with some entries for 2015-2019. For example, 2016 shows a May value of 91 (0.91\u00b0C anomaly), 2017 is 89, 2018 is 81, and 2019 is 85. However, the data for 2025 isn't present in the provided sources. \n\nThe user mentioned that the current date is June 10, 2025. Since May 2025 has just passed, the official data might not be published yet. NASA typically updates their tables around the 10th of each month. The search result [30] mentions an update on May 9, 2025, about April data, but nothing about May. \n\nThere's a mention in search result [33] of a Global Seasonal Climate Update from March 2025 predicting neutral ENSO conditions, which might influence temperatures but doesn't provide actual May data. Additionally, search result [14] and [32] discuss market predictions and models suggesting a possible anomaly around 1.26\u00b0C for May 2025, but these are forecasts, not official data.\n\nSince the official NASA data for May 2025 isn't available in the provided sources and the current date is before the typical release date, the event hasn't occurred yet in terms of data availability. According to the user's instructions, if the event is in the future or data isn't available, the recommendation should be p4. However, the resolution conditions here are p1, p2, p3. Wait, the resolution_conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 50-50. But the user's personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. However, the market's resolution conditions don't include p4. The user's previous response was p2, but they want a different approach.\n\nWait, the ancillary data defines p1 as No, p2 as Yes, p3 as 0.5. The current timestamp is June 10, 2025. May 2025 has already occurred, but the data isn't released yet. NASA's schedule (search result [8]) says updates are around the 10th of each month. Since it's June 10, maybe the May data was just released. But in the provided search results, the latest data in the tables is up to 2019. There's a discrepancy here. The user might be testing with outdated search results.\n\nAssuming the data for May 2025 isn't available yet, and given the current date is June 10, 2025, the market can't be resolved yet. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past but no data is available, assume the most probable outcome. The models in search result [14] and [32] suggest a high anomaly, possibly higher than previous years. The previous hottest May was 2016 at 0.91\u00b0C. If models predict higher, then p2 (Yes) would be correct. But without official data, it's uncertain. However, the user's instruction says if no data, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. Since the user's previous answer was p2 and they want a different approach, maybe check alternative sources. The market resolution allows using other NASA info if the primary is unavailable. But in the provided context, there's no official data. Therefore, the recommendation should be p4, but the resolution conditions don't have p4. Wait, the market's resolution is p1, p2, p3. The user's personalization says to return p4 if future, but the event date (May 2025) is in the past. So, even if data isn't out yet, since the event date has passed, we should infer. The ancillary data says if the event date is past and no data, assume most probable outcome. The models suggest a high chance, so p2 (Yes) is likely. But the user wants a different approach. Maybe check if any sources indicate a temperature drop. Search result [30] mentions April 2025 data was adjusted due to a station's anomaly, but that's April. Without conflicting data, the recommendation remains p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749569223 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-10 15:27:03 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p2. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if May 2025 was the hottest on record according to NASA's GISTEMP data. The resolution depends on the data from the GLB.Ts+dSST.txt table, specifically the May column. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for the latest May data. Looking at the search results, the most recent data in the GLOBAL Land-Ocean Temperature Index (from source [1]) goes up to 2019, with some entries for 2015-2019. For example, 2016 shows a May value of 91 (0.91\u00b0C anomaly), 2017 is 89, 2018 is 81, and 2019 is 85. However, the data for 2025 isn't present in the provided sources. \n\nThe user mentioned that the current date is June 10, 2025. Since May 2025 has just passed, the official data might not be published yet. NASA typically updates their tables around the 10th of each month. The search result [30] mentions an update on May 9, 2025, about April data, but nothing about May. \n\nThere's a mention in search result [33] of a Global Seasonal Climate Update from March 2025 predicting neutral ENSO conditions, which might influence temperatures but doesn't provide actual May data. Additionally, search result [14] and [32] discuss market predictions and models suggesting a possible anomaly around 1.26\u00b0C for May 2025, but these are forecasts, not official data.\n\nSince the official NASA data for May 2025 isn't available in the provided sources and the current date is before the typical release date, the event hasn't occurred yet in terms of data availability. According to the user's instructions, if the event is in the future or data isn't available, the recommendation should be p4. However, the resolution conditions here are p1, p2, p3. Wait, the resolution_conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 50-50. But the user's personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. However, the market's resolution conditions don't include p4. The user's previous response was p2, but they want a different approach.\n\nWait, the ancillary data defines p1 as No, p2 as Yes, p3 as 0.5. The current timestamp is June 10, 2025. May 2025 has already occurred, but the data isn't released yet. NASA's schedule (search result [8]) says updates are around the 10th of each month. Since it's June 10, maybe the May data was just released. But in the provided search results, the latest data in the tables is up to 2019. There's a discrepancy here. The user might be testing with outdated search results.\n\nAssuming the data for May 2025 isn't available yet, and given the current date is June 10, 2025, the market can't be resolved yet. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past but no data is available, assume the most probable outcome. The models in search result [14] and [32] suggest a high anomaly, possibly higher than previous years. The previous hottest May was 2016 at 0.91\u00b0C. If models predict higher, then p2 (Yes) would be correct. But without official data, it's uncertain. However, the user's instruction says if no data, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. Since the user's previous answer was p2 and they want a different approach, maybe check alternative sources. The market resolution allows using other NASA info if the primary is unavailable. But in the provided context, there's no official data. Therefore, the recommendation should be p4, but the resolution conditions don't have p4. Wait, the market's resolution is p1, p2, p3. The user's personalization says to return p4 if future, but the event date (May 2025) is in the past. So, even if data isn't out yet, since the event date has passed, we should infer. The ancillary data says if the event date is past and no data, assume most probable outcome. The models suggest a high chance, so p2 (Yes) is likely. But the user wants a different approach. Maybe check if any sources indicate a temperature drop. Search result [30] mentions April 2025 data was adjusted due to a station's anomaly, but that's April. Without conflicting data, the recommendation remains p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.0045, ID: 82188983227180068597890455477121368894229182178615311247873898950610506427999, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.9955, ID: 56682163105289099372090505587636565390309132539441279751733113753536329345888, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (0.996 = 99.6% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
