The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\"), college football (e.g., \"What was the score of the Alabama game last Saturday?\"), college basketball (e.g., \"What was Duke's score in their last game?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Diamondbacks vs. Braves, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for June 4 at 7:15PM ET:\nIf the Arizona Diamondbacks win, the market will resolve to \"Diamondbacks\".\nIf the Atlanta Braves win, the market will resolve to \"Braves\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\nTo know when a postponed game will be played, please check the home team's schedule on MLB.com for the listed team and look for the game described as a makeup game.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Braves, p2 to Diamondbacks, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.

Where p1 corresponds to Braves, p2 to Diamondbacks, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Braves, p2 = Diamondbacks\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Diamondbacks outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.770 = 77.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Diamondbacks vs. Braves, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for June 4 at 7:15PM ET:\nIf the Arizona Diamondbacks win, the market will resolve to \"Diamondbacks\".\nIf the Atlanta Braves win, the market will resolve to \"Braves\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\nTo know when a postponed game will be played, please check the home team's schedule on MLB.com for the listed team and look for the game described as a makeup game.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Braves, p2 to Diamondbacks, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749092957 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-05 03:09:17 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Ensure API keys are valid and functional.

CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749092957 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-05 03:09:17 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Ensure API keys are valid and functional.

Recommendation found: p4.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p4\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Diamondbacks, Price: 0.77, ID: 100297321641593229703844127465644016058670441243724253694362213773131342179040, Winner: No\n- Token: Braves, Price: 0.23, ID: 88190125911663545672266452325049493905624701749898241886552578213784210129244, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Braves, p2 to Diamondbacks, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Braves, p2 = Diamondbacks\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Diamondbacks outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.770 = 77.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Diamondbacks vs. Braves, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for June 4 at 7:15PM ET:\nIf the Arizona Diamondbacks win, the market will resolve to \"Diamondbacks\".\nIf the Atlanta Braves win, the market will resolve to \"Braves\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\nTo know when a postponed game will be played, please check the home team's schedule on MLB.com for the listed team and look for the game described as a makeup game.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Braves, p2 to Diamondbacks, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749092957 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-05 03:09:17 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Ensure API keys are valid and functional. Consider using a different data source or method to verify the game outcome if API issues persist.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4.

Where p1 corresponds to Braves, p2 to Diamondbacks, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Braves, p2 = Diamondbacks\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Diamondbacks outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.770 = 77.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The key here is to determine the outcome based on verified facts. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The timestamp given is June 5, 2025, so the game in question happened on June 4, which is in the past. That means I need to find out if the game was played, postponed, or canceled. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources like [2], [5], [10], [11], and [12] report that the Diamondbacks won 8-3 against the Braves on June 3. Wait, the game was scheduled for June 4? Wait, there's a discrepancy here. Let me check the dates again. \n\nResult [6] mentions the series started on June 3, with the Diamondbacks leading 1-0. Then, the game on June 4 is the second in the series. However, results [2], [5], [10], [11], and [12] all describe a game on June 3 where the Diamondbacks won 8-3. The user's query is about the game on June 4. \n\nWait, looking at result [6], the article from June 4 says the Diamondbacks lead the series 1-0, and the next game is on June 4 with Merrill Kelly vs. Chris Sale. Then, result [3] mentions Merrill Kelly's performance on June 4, striking out eight Braves. Result [8] is a video from June 4 showing Gurriel's RBI single. Result [9] is the box score for the June 4 game, which shows the Diamondbacks vs. Braves with Sale pitching. \n\nWait, there's confusion because some sources refer to the June 3 game as a Diamondbacks win, and the June 4 game is another matchup. The user's query is about the June 4 game. Let me clarify:\n\n- The June 3 game: Diamondbacks won 8-3 (sources [2], [5], [10], [11], [12]).\n- The June 4 game: The user is asking about this. The ancillary data mentions the game on June 4 at 7:15 PM ET. \n\nLooking at result [6], the June 4 game is the second in the series, with Merrill Kelly pitching for the Diamondbacks and Chris Sale for the Braves. Result [3] mentions Merrill Kelly's performance on June 4, going seven innings with eight strikeouts and one hit allowed. Result [9] is the box score for the June 4 game, which shows the Diamondbacks vs. Braves, but the detailed play-by-play indicates that the game was low-scoring. However, the final score isn't explicitly stated in the provided snippets. \n\nWait, result [3] says Merrill Kelly let up just one hit over seven innings. If the Diamondbacks won that game, then the resolution would be p2 (Diamondbacks). But I need to confirm the actual outcome. \n\nLooking at result [6], the article from June 4 says the Diamondbacks lead the series 1-0, implying they won the first game (June 3) and the June 4 game is the second. However, the user's query is about the June 4 game. \n\nWait, the ancillary data in the user's query says the game is scheduled for June 4 at 7:15 PM ET. The current timestamp is June 5, 2025, so the game has already occurred. \n\nResult [9] is the box score for the June 4 game. The play-by-play shows that by the end of the 7th inning, the Diamondbacks had 0 runs and the Braves had 0 runs. However, the game might have gone into extra innings or had a later outcome. But the provided snippets don't show the final score. \n\nResult [3] mentions Merrill",

The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Diamondbacks vs. Braves game on June 4, 2025. The key here is to determine the outcome based on verified facts. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The timestamp given is June 5, 2025, so the game in question happened on June 4, which is in the past. That means I need to find out if the game was played, postponed, or canceled. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources like [2], [5], [10], [11], and [12] report that the Diamondbacks won 8-3 against the Braves on June 3. Wait, the game was scheduled for June 4? Wait, there's a discrepancy here. Let me check the dates again. \n\nResult [6] mentions the series started on June 3, with the Diamondbacks leading 1-0. Then, the game on June 4 is the second in the series. However, results [2], [5], [10], [11], and [12] all describe a game on June 3 where the Diamondbacks won 8-3. The user's query is about the game on June 4. \n\nWait, looking at result [6], the article from June 4 says the Diamondbacks lead the series 1-0, and the next game is on June 4 with Merrill Kelly vs. Chris Sale. Then, result [3] mentions Merrill Kelly's performance on June 4, striking out eight Braves. Result [8] is a video from June 4 showing Gurriel's RBI single. Result [9] is the box score for the June 4 game, which shows the Diamondbacks vs. Braves with Sale pitching. \n\nWait, there's confusion because some sources refer to the June 3 game as a Diamondbacks win, and the June 4 game is another matchup. The user's query is about the June 4 game. Let me clarify:\n\n- The June 3 game: Diamondbacks won 8-3 (sources [2], [5], [10], [11], [12]).\n- The June 4 game: The user is asking about this. The ancillary data mentions the game on June 4 at 7:15 PM ET. \n\nLooking at result [6], the June 4 game is the second in the series, with Merrill Kelly pitching for the Diamondbacks and Chris Sale for the Braves. Result [3] mentions Merrill Kelly's performance on June 4, going seven innings with eight strikeouts and one hit allowed. Result [9] is the box score for the June 4 game, which shows the Diamondbacks vs. Braves, but the detailed play-by-play indicates that the game was low-scoring. However, the final score isn't explicitly stated in the provided snippets. \n\nWait, result [3] says Merrill Kelly let up just one hit over seven innings. If the Diamondbacks won that game, then the resolution would be p2 (Diamondbacks). But I need to confirm the actual outcome. \n\nLooking at result [6], the article from June 4 says the Diamondbacks lead the series 1-0, implying they won the first game (June 3) and the June 4 game is the second. However, the user's query is about the June 4 game. \n\nWait, the ancillary data in the user's query says the game is scheduled for June 4 at 7:15 PM ET. The current timestamp is June 5, 2025, so the game has already occurred. \n\nResult [9] is the box score for the June 4 game. The play-by-play shows that by the end of the 7th inning, the Diamondbacks had 0 runs and the Braves had 0 runs. However, the game might have gone into extra innings or had a later outcome. But the provided snippets don't show the final score. \n\nResult [3] mentions Merrill\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Diamondbacks, Price: 0.77, ID: 100297321641593229703844127465644016058670441243724253694362213773131342179040, Winner: No\n- Token: Braves, Price: 0.23, ID: 88190125911663545672266452325049493905624701749898241886552578213784210129244, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Braves, p2 to Diamondbacks, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Braves, p2 = Diamondbacks\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Diamondbacks outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.770 = 77.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know the outcome of the Diamondbacks vs. Braves game on June 4, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Diamondbacks win, it's p2; Braves win is p1, and so on. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. Looking at the sources, several mention the June 3 game where the Diamondbacks won 8-3. But the user is asking about June 4. Wait, there's a mix here. Some sources like [3], [4], [8], and [9] talk about a June 4 game being delayed due to rain. The original query might have a date confusion. Wait, the user's query says June 4, but some results refer to June 3. Let me check the dates carefully.\n\nLooking at [1], [6], [11], [14], [15], [17], and [18], they all describe a game on June 3 where the Diamondbacks won 8-3. However, the user is asking about June 4. The sources [3], [4], [8], and [9] discuss a June 4 game that was delayed by rain. The user's query might have a typo, or perhaps the game on June 4 was postponed. Wait, the current timestamp is June 5, 2025, so the June 4 game should have happened. \n\nLooking at [10], there's a video titled \"Merrill Kelly strikes out eight Braves | 06/04/2025\" which suggests the June 4 game did occur. Also, [18] mentions the series is 1-0 in favor of Arizona after June 3, and the next game on June 4 is with Merrill Kelly vs. Chris Sale. However, [3] and [4] mention a rain delay on June 4, with the game starting at 8:20 PM ET. \n\nWait, [10] shows Merrill Kelly pitching on June 4 and striking out eight Braves. That implies the game was played. Additionally, [17] mentions the Braves lost the June 3 game and the next game is June 4 at 7:15 PM. But [3] and [4] say the June 4 game was delayed but started at 8:20 PM. Then, [10] confirms Merrill Kelly's performance on June 4, indicating the game was completed. \n\nSo, the June 4 game did happen despite the delay. The Diamondbacks' Merrill Kelly pitched well, striking out eight, and the Braves' Chris Sale was the opposing pitcher. However, the search results don't explicitly state the final score of the June 4 game. Wait, [10] only mentions Kelly's performance but not the outcome. Other sources like [4] and [8] discuss the delay but not the result. \n\nWait, the user's query is about the June 4 game. The ancillary data says if the game is postponed, it remains open, but if played, resolve based on the winner. The search results don't have a clear report on the June 4 game's outcome. However, [18] mentions the series is 1-0 after June 3, and the next game is June 4. But there's no follow-up on that game's result. \n\nWait, the current date is June 5, 2025. The user is asking about the June 4 game. If the game was played on June 4, even with a delay, and there's no report of cancellation, but the search results don't provide the score, how do I proceed? The instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nBut wait, the user provided a URL in the personalization instructions, but I don't see any URLs in the query. The search results include [10] which is a video of Merrill Kelly's performance on June 4, but it doesn't give the final score. The other sources about June 4 discuss the delay but not the result. \n\nGiven that the June 3 game was a Diamondbacks win, and the June 4 game's outcome isn't clearly reported, but the user's query specifically asks for June 4, I need to check if there's any mention of that game's result. \n\nLooking again, [10] says Merrill Kelly went seven innings, allowing one hit and striking out eight. If he pitched that well, maybe the Diamondbacks won. But without explicit confirmation, it's risky. However, the user's personalization says to resolve based on verifiable facts. Since there's no explicit result for June 4 in the search results, but the game was played (as per [10]), and the user's instructions say if no info is available but the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nThe ancillary data says if the game is canceled, resolve 50-50, but if played, resolve based on the winner. Since the game was played (as per [10]), but no score is given, perhaps the user made a mistake in the date, and the actual game they're asking about is June 3, which the Diamondbacks won. But the user insists on June 4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the June 4 game was postponed and rescheduled, but the sources say it started at 8:20 PM. If the game was completed, but no result is in the search results, I have to default to p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nBut how to determine the probable outcome? The Diamondbacks had Merrill Kelly pitching well, and the Braves had Chris Sale. If Kelly allowed one hit over seven innings, maybe the Diamondbacks won. But without the actual score, it's speculative. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says to focus on the final score and winner. The search results don't provide that for June 4. Therefore, based on the provided data, there's no verifiable information about the June 4 game's outcome. Thus, according to the instructions, if no verifiable info, resolve p4. But the user's personalization also says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nBut how to determine probable? The ancillary data's resolution conditions don't have a p4, but the user's personalization says to end with recommendation p1-p4. The instructions mention p4 for unresolved. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the user intended June 3, which the Diamondbacks won. But the query explicitly says June 4. Since the search results don't confirm the June 4 outcome, I have to recommend p4. However, [10] shows Merrill Kelly's performance, implying the game was played. If the Diamondbacks won, it's p2. But without the score, it's unclear. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The conditions in the ancillary data say if the game is canceled, 50-50. But if played, resolve based on the winner. Since the game was played (started after delay), but no result is found, perhaps it's considered incomplete? Or maybe the lack of reports indicates it wasn't played. \n\nThis is conflicting. The correct approach is to check if the game was completed. Since [10] mentions Merrill Kelly pitched seven innings, the game likely concluded. Therefore, the Diamondbacks would have won if Kelly performed well. But without the actual score, it's not verifiable. \n\nIn this case, per the instructions, if no verifiable info, resolve p4. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749092957 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-05 03:09:17 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please provide a clear and definitive outcome of the game on June 4, 2025, between the Diamondbacks and Braves, focusing on the final score and the winner.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know the outcome of the Diamondbacks vs. Braves game on June 4, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Diamondbacks win, it's p2; Braves win is p1, and so on. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. Looking at the sources, several mention the June 3 game where the Diamondbacks won 8-3. But the user is asking about June 4. Wait, there's a mix here. Some sources like [3], [4], [8], and [9] talk about a June 4 game being delayed due to rain. The original query might have a date confusion. Wait, the user's query says June 4, but some results refer to June 3. Let me check the dates carefully.\n\nLooking at [1], [6], [11], [14], [15], [17], and [18], they all describe a game on June 3 where the Diamondbacks won 8-3. However, the user is asking about June 4. The sources [3], [4], [8], and [9] discuss a June 4 game that was delayed by rain. The user's query might have a typo, or perhaps the game on June 4 was postponed. Wait, the current timestamp is June 5, 2025, so the June 4 game should have happened. \n\nLooking at [10], there's a video titled \"Merrill Kelly strikes out eight Braves | 06/04/2025\" which suggests the June 4 game did occur. Also, [18] mentions the series is 1-0 in favor of Arizona after June 3, and the next game on June 4 is with Merrill Kelly vs. Chris Sale. However, [3] and [4] mention a rain delay on June 4, with the game starting at 8:20 PM ET. \n\nWait, [10] shows Merrill Kelly pitching on June 4 and striking out eight Braves. That implies the game was played. Additionally, [17] mentions the Braves lost the June 3 game and the next game is June 4 at 7:15 PM. But [3] and [4] say the June 4 game was delayed but started at 8:20 PM. Then, [10] confirms Merrill Kelly's performance on June 4, indicating the game was completed. \n\nSo, the June 4 game did happen despite the delay. The Diamondbacks' Merrill Kelly pitched well, striking out eight, and the Braves' Chris Sale was the opposing pitcher. However, the search results don't explicitly state the final score of the June 4 game. Wait, [10] only mentions Kelly's performance but not the outcome. Other sources like [4] and [8] discuss the delay but not the result. \n\nWait, the user's query is about the June 4 game. The ancillary data says if the game is postponed, it remains open, but if played, resolve based on the winner. The search results don't have a clear report on the June 4 game's outcome. However, [18] mentions the series is 1-0 after June 3, and the next game is June 4. But there's no follow-up on that game's result. \n\nWait, the current date is June 5, 2025. The user is asking about the June 4 game. If the game was played on June 4, even with a delay, and there's no report of cancellation, but the search results don't provide the score, how do I proceed? The instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nBut wait, the user provided a URL in the personalization instructions, but I don't see any URLs in the query. The search results include [10] which is a video of Merrill Kelly's performance on June 4, but it doesn't give the final score. The other sources about June 4 discuss the delay but not the result. \n\nGiven that the June 3 game was a Diamondbacks win, and the June 4 game's outcome isn't clearly reported, but the user's query specifically asks for June 4, I need to check if there's any mention of that game's result. \n\nLooking again, [10] says Merrill Kelly went seven innings, allowing one hit and striking out eight. If he pitched that well, maybe the Diamondbacks won. But without explicit confirmation, it's risky. However, the user's personalization says to resolve based on verifiable facts. Since there's no explicit result for June 4 in the search results, but the game was played (as per [10]), and the user's instructions say if no info is available but the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nThe ancillary data says if the game is canceled, resolve 50-50, but if played, resolve based on the winner. Since the game was played (as per [10]), but no score is given, perhaps the user made a mistake in the date, and the actual game they're asking about is June 3, which the Diamondbacks won. But the user insists on June 4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the June 4 game was postponed and rescheduled, but the sources say it started at 8:20 PM. If the game was completed, but no result is in the search results, I have to default to p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nBut how to determine the probable outcome? The Diamondbacks had Merrill Kelly pitching well, and the Braves had Chris Sale. If Kelly allowed one hit over seven innings, maybe the Diamondbacks won. But without the actual score, it's speculative. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says to focus on the final score and winner. The search results don't provide that for June 4. Therefore, based on the provided data, there's no verifiable information about the June 4 game's outcome. Thus, according to the instructions, if no verifiable info, resolve p4. But the user's personalization also says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nBut how to determine probable? The ancillary data's resolution conditions don't have a p4, but the user's personalization says to end with recommendation p1-p4. The instructions mention p4 for unresolved. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the user intended June 3, which the Diamondbacks won. But the query explicitly says June 4. Since the search results don't confirm the June 4 outcome, I have to recommend p4. However, [10] shows Merrill Kelly's performance, implying the game was played. If the Diamondbacks won, it's p2. But without the score, it's unclear. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The conditions in the ancillary data say if the game is canceled, 50-50. But if played, resolve based on the winner. Since the game was played (started after delay), but no result is found, perhaps it's considered incomplete? Or maybe the lack of reports indicates it wasn't played. \n\nThis is conflicting. The correct approach is to check if the game was completed. Since [10] mentions Merrill Kelly pitched seven innings, the game likely concluded. Therefore, the Diamondbacks would have won if Kelly performed well. But without the actual score, it's not verifiable. \n\nIn this case, per the instructions, if no verifiable info, resolve p4. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Diamondbacks, Price: 0.77, ID: 100297321641593229703844127465644016058670441243724253694362213773131342179040, Winner: No\n- Token: Braves, Price: 0.23, ID: 88190125911663545672266452325049493905624701749898241886552578213784210129244, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Braves, p2 to Diamondbacks, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Braves, p2 = Diamondbacks\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Diamondbacks outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.770 = 77.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The ancillary data specifies that if the Diamondbacks win, it's p2; Braves win, p1; postponed remains open; canceled is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is June 5, 2025, so the game date is in the past. The search results include multiple sources. Let's look at the box scores and recaps.\n\nSearch result [1] is a boxscore from Fox Sports dated June 4, 2025. It mentions Strider took the loss, giving up five runs. The Diamondbacks are listed as AZ with a score, and the Braves as ATL. The final score isn't explicitly stated here, but the context suggests a Diamondbacks win.\n\nResult [2] from CBS Sports has a detailed recap. The headline says Marte and Carroll homered, leading the Diamondbacks to an 8-3 win. The article mentions Zac Gallen pitched well, and Spencer Strider struggled. The final score here is 8-3 in favor of Arizona.\n\nResult [3] from The Score shows the final score as Diamondbacks 2, Braves 1. Wait, that seems conflicting. But looking closer, the scoring summary shows Diamondbacks scoring in the 3rd and 9th, Braves in the 9th. However, the recap in [2] has a different score. Need to check which is accurate.\n\nWait, result [6] from Fox Sports on June 4 lists the final score as 8-3 for Arizona. Result [3] might have a typo or different game? Let me check the dates. All these are June 4, 2025. Hmm, maybe the Score's data is incorrect. The CBS Sports recap is more detailed and mentions an 8-3 score, which aligns with the Fox Sports boxscore in [6]. The Score's result might be a mistake or a different game. Since multiple sources confirm 8-3, I'll go with that.\n\nResult [9] mentions Merrill Kelly striking out eight Braves, but that's from June 4, 2025, which might be a different game. Wait, no, the game in question is June 4. Wait, the user's query is about June 4, but some results mention June 3. Need to check dates carefully.\n\nResult [2] is clearly about June 4, as the headline states Tuesday night, which matches June 4, 2025 (since the current date is June 5). The recap there is definitive: Diamondbacks won 8-3. \n\nAdditionally, result [16] mentions Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. getting a hit off Merrill Kelly in the 6th inning on June 4, which aligns with the Diamondbacks' pitcher. \n\nThe starting lineups in [15] confirm the game was played on June 4. There's also a mention of a rain delay for the June 4 game in [4] and [5], but those are about the June 4 game being delayed but eventually played. The final result from [2] and [6] confirms the game was completed with a Diamondbacks victory.\n\nTherefore, the game was played, not postponed or canceled. The Diamondbacks won 8-3. According to the resolution conditions, this should resolve to p2 (Diamondbacks).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Reassess the available information to determine if a more definitive conclusion can be reached based on the performance data and market sentiment.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Diamondbacks vs. Braves game on June 4, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Diamondbacks win, it's p2; Braves win, p1; postponed remains open; canceled is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is June 5, 2025, so the game date is in the past. The search results include multiple sources. Let's look at the box scores and recaps.\n\nSearch result [1] is a boxscore from Fox Sports dated June 4, 2025. It mentions Strider took the loss, giving up five runs. The Diamondbacks are listed as AZ with a score, and the Braves as ATL. The final score isn't explicitly stated here, but the context suggests a Diamondbacks win.\n\nResult [2] from CBS Sports has a detailed recap. The headline says Marte and Carroll homered, leading the Diamondbacks to an 8-3 win. The article mentions Zac Gallen pitched well, and Spencer Strider struggled. The final score here is 8-3 in favor of Arizona.\n\nResult [3] from The Score shows the final score as Diamondbacks 2, Braves 1. Wait, that seems conflicting. But looking closer, the scoring summary shows Diamondbacks scoring in the 3rd and 9th, Braves in the 9th. However, the recap in [2] has a different score. Need to check which is accurate.\n\nWait, result [6] from Fox Sports on June 4 lists the final score as 8-3 for Arizona. Result [3] might have a typo or different game? Let me check the dates. All these are June 4, 2025. Hmm, maybe the Score's data is incorrect. The CBS Sports recap is more detailed and mentions an 8-3 score, which aligns with the Fox Sports boxscore in [6]. The Score's result might be a mistake or a different game. Since multiple sources confirm 8-3, I'll go with that.\n\nResult [9] mentions Merrill Kelly striking out eight Braves, but that's from June 4, 2025, which might be a different game. Wait, no, the game in question is June 4. Wait, the user's query is about June 4, but some results mention June 3. Need to check dates carefully.\n\nResult [2] is clearly about June 4, as the headline states Tuesday night, which matches June 4, 2025 (since the current date is June 5). The recap there is definitive: Diamondbacks won 8-3. \n\nAdditionally, result [16] mentions Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. getting a hit off Merrill Kelly in the 6th inning on June 4, which aligns with the Diamondbacks' pitcher. \n\nThe starting lineups in [15] confirm the game was played on June 4. There's also a mention of a rain delay for the June 4 game in [4] and [5], but those are about the June 4 game being delayed but eventually played. The final result from [2] and [6] confirms the game was completed with a Diamondbacks victory.\n\nTherefore, the game was played, not postponed or canceled. The Diamondbacks won 8-3. According to the resolution conditions, this should resolve to p2 (Diamondbacks).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Diamondbacks, Price: 0.77, ID: 100297321641593229703844127465644016058670441243724253694362213773131342179040, Winner: No\n- Token: Braves, Price: 0.23, ID: 88190125911663545672266452325049493905624701749898241886552578213784210129244, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Braves, p2 to Diamondbacks, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Braves, p2 = Diamondbacks\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Diamondbacks outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.770 = 77.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749092957 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-05 03:09:17 UTC",
