      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market asking if the Palmeiras vs. FC Porto match on June 15, 2025, had 3 or more goals. The resolution depends on whether the total goals exceed 2.5. The current date is June 16, 2025, so the event has already occurred.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for the match outcome. Looking at the sources:\n\n1. Source [1] from Fox Sports shows the final score as Palmeiras 1-2 FC Porto. That's a total of 3 goals. \n2. Source [14] from Bolavip mentions a 0-0 draw, but that seems to be a live blog from the first half. Wait, no, looking closer, the final result in [14] says they drew 0-0, but that contradicts [1]. Hmm, need to check other sources.\n3. Source [13] on Flashscore also mentions the halftime score as 0-0 but later in the updates, there's a mention of a 1-0 lead, but it's unclear. Wait, the user provided a lot of sources, some might be conflicting.\n4. Source [3] (Wikipedia) lists the group stage matches. For Palmeiras vs. Porto, it says \"Match 4\" with no score reported yet. But the page was updated after June 14, so maybe the score wasn't updated there.\n5. Source [15] from AS.com reports the final score as 0-0. But wait, that's in Spanish. Let me check again. The title says \"Palmeiras 0-0 Oporto: resumen y resultado\". So according to AS.com, it ended 0-0.\n6. Source [16] from TV Azteca also mentions a 0-0 draw in their live updates.\n\nWait, there's a contradiction here. Fox Sports [1] says 1-2, but AS.com [15] and TV Azteca [16] say 0-0. How to resolve this?\n\nLooking deeper into the sources:\n\n- Source [1] (Fox Sports) has a box score showing Palmeiras 1, FC Porto 2. The URL is from June 14, but the game was on June 15. Maybe the date is a typo? The page content mentions the game on June 15, 2025, and the box score shows 1-2. However, other sources like [14], [15], [16] report 0-0. This is conflicting.\n\n- Source [13] (Flashscore) in their live blog mentions that in the second half, the score was still 0-0, but then later updates about other matches. Wait, their live blog for Palmeiras vs. Porto says \"Second half is underway\" and then later mentions \"End of the match\" without a score. Hmm, maybe the live blog didn't update the final score.\n\n- Source [14] (Bolavip) in Spanish says the match ended 0-0, with a detailed live commentary confirming no goals. Similarly, source [15] (AS.com) also reports 0-0.\n\n- Source [16] (TV Azteca) also states the final result was 0-0.\n\nBut source [1] (Fox Sports) clearly states 1-2. This is conflicting. How to verify which is correct?\n\nLooking at source [10] (ESPN IN) live score, it shows the match as 0-0 with lineups and some match events but no final score. However, the page might not have been updated post-match.\n\nSource [11] (SportsGambler) prediction page from before the match doesn't have the result.\n\nSource [12] (YouTube) is a preview, so no help.\n\nSource [6] (DasFootball) highlights page is from before the match, so no result.\n\nSource [4] (SofaScore) lists the match as 0-0, with no goals scored. The detailed timeline shows fouls but no goals.\n\nSource [7] (ESPN) for Palmeiras' FIFA Club World Cup results doesn't list the match yet.\n\nSource [8] (BeSoccer) analysis doesn't include the result.\n\nSource [9] (Bolavip) is about where to watch, not the result.\n\nSource [2] (beIN Sports) is a live blog before the match, no result.\n\nSo, conflicting info between Fox Sports [1] reporting 1-2 and multiple other sources ([4], [14], [15], [16]) reporting 0-0. Need to determine which is accurate.\n\nCheck the timestamps. The current timestamp is June 16, 2025. Fox Sports [1] is dated June 14, 2025, but the game was on June 15. That might be a pre-match page, and the actual result wasn't updated. The URL says \"game-boxscore-614850\" which might be a placeholder. The content in [1] shows a box score with 1-2, but the other sources that are post-match (like [14], [15], [16]) all report 0-0. Additionally, SofaScore [4] and Flashscore [13] (which are live score trackers) would have updated the result if goals were scored. Since they show 0-0, it's more likely the correct result is 0-0.\n\nTherefore, the total goals are 0, which is under 2.5. The market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). However, need to confirm again. Wait, source [1] might have incorrect data. Since multiple sources from live blogs and post-match reports in Spanish (AS.com, TV Azteca, Bolavip) confirm 0-0, it's more credible that the match ended goalless. Thus, the answer is \"No\", p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750032399 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-16 00:06:39 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market asking if the Palmeiras vs. FC Porto match on June 15, 2025, had 3 or more goals. The resolution depends on whether the total goals exceed 2.5. The current date is June 16, 2025, so the event has already occurred.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for the match outcome. Looking at the sources:\n\n1. Source [1] from Fox Sports shows the final score as Palmeiras 1-2 FC Porto. That's a total of 3 goals. \n2. Source [14] from Bolavip mentions a 0-0 draw, but that seems to be a live blog from the first half. Wait, no, looking closer, the final result in [14] says they drew 0-0, but that contradicts [1]. Hmm, need to check other sources.\n3. Source [13] on Flashscore also mentions the halftime score as 0-0 but later in the updates, there's a mention of a 1-0 lead, but it's unclear. Wait, the user provided a lot of sources, some might be conflicting.\n4. Source [3] (Wikipedia) lists the group stage matches. For Palmeiras vs. Porto, it says \"Match 4\" with no score reported yet. But the page was updated after June 14, so maybe the score wasn't updated there.\n5. Source [15] from AS.com reports the final score as 0-0. But wait, that's in Spanish. Let me check again. The title says \"Palmeiras 0-0 Oporto: resumen y resultado\". So according to AS.com, it ended 0-0.\n6. Source [16] from TV Azteca also mentions a 0-0 draw in their live updates.\n\nWait, there's a contradiction here. Fox Sports [1] says 1-2, but AS.com [15] and TV Azteca [16] say 0-0. How to resolve this?\n\nLooking deeper into the sources:\n\n- Source [1] (Fox Sports) has a box score showing Palmeiras 1, FC Porto 2. The URL is from June 14, but the game was on June 15. Maybe the date is a typo? The page content mentions the game on June 15, 2025, and the box score shows 1-2. However, other sources like [14], [15], [16] report 0-0. This is conflicting.\n\n- Source [13] (Flashscore) in their live blog mentions that in the second half, the score was still 0-0, but then later updates about other matches. Wait, their live blog for Palmeiras vs. Porto says \"Second half is underway\" and then later mentions \"End of the match\" without a score. Hmm, maybe the live blog didn't update the final score.\n\n- Source [14] (Bolavip) in Spanish says the match ended 0-0, with a detailed live commentary confirming no goals. Similarly, source [15] (AS.com) also reports 0-0.\n\n- Source [16] (TV Azteca) also states the final result was 0-0.\n\nBut source [1] (Fox Sports) clearly states 1-2. This is conflicting. How to verify which is correct?\n\nLooking at source [10] (ESPN IN) live score, it shows the match as 0-0 with lineups and some match events but no final score. However, the page might not have been updated post-match.\n\nSource [11] (SportsGambler) prediction page from before the match doesn't have the result.\n\nSource [12] (YouTube) is a preview, so no help.\n\nSource [6] (DasFootball) highlights page is from before the match, so no result.\n\nSource [4] (SofaScore) lists the match as 0-0, with no goals scored. The detailed timeline shows fouls but no goals.\n\nSource [7] (ESPN) for Palmeiras' FIFA Club World Cup results doesn't list the match yet.\n\nSource [8] (BeSoccer) analysis doesn't include the result.\n\nSource [9] (Bolavip) is about where to watch, not the result.\n\nSource [2] (beIN Sports) is a live blog before the match, no result.\n\nSo, conflicting info between Fox Sports [1] reporting 1-2 and multiple other sources ([4], [14], [15], [16]) reporting 0-0. Need to determine which is accurate.\n\nCheck the timestamps. The current timestamp is June 16, 2025. Fox Sports [1] is dated June 14, 2025, but the game was on June 15. That might be a pre-match page, and the actual result wasn't updated. The URL says \"game-boxscore-614850\" which might be a placeholder. The content in [1] shows a box score with 1-2, but the other sources that are post-match (like [14], [15], [16]) all report 0-0. Additionally, SofaScore [4] and Flashscore [13] (which are live score trackers) would have updated the result if goals were scored. Since they show 0-0, it's more likely the correct result is 0-0.\n\nTherefore, the total goals are 0, which is under 2.5. The market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). However, need to confirm again. Wait, source [1] might have incorrect data. Since multiple sources from live blogs and post-match reports in Spanish (AS.com, TV Azteca, Bolavip) confirm 0-0, it's more credible that the match ended goalless. Thus, the answer is \"No\", p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.05, ID: 109454554835131236024307603462618614682655374129247887039728983884028987270052, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.95, ID: 83388492640032136302207041639789689790907504404673333771932672116161073943366, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (0.950 = 95.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
