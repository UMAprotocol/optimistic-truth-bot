The answer needs to be based on the provided search results and the current date, which is June 15, 2025, 1:16 AM UTC.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the event happened as scheduled. The search results mention the parade took place on June 14, 2025.

So the event wasn't canceled, and Trump did give a speech.\n\nNext, I need to look for mentions of Trump using the word \"woke\" during his main speech at this event. Let's go through the sources. \n\nSource [5] is a transcript from Trump's speech at Fort Bragg on June 11, where Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth mentions rejecting \"woke garbage and political correctness,\" but that's a different event before the main parade. \n\nSource [20] includes a transcript of Trump's speech at Fort Bragg on June 11, where he says, \"We\u2019re getting wokeness out of our schools and out of our military, and it\u2019s already out, and it\u2019s out of our society. We don\u2019t want it. Wokeness is trouble. Wokeness is bad. It\u2019s gone. It\u2019s gone.\" But again, this is from the June 11 event, not the main June 14 speech.\n\nLooking at sources related to the June 14 parade, source [42] (ABC News) mentions Trump's remarks at the parade were brief and didn't stray into political topics. Source [56] (ABC11) also states that Trump's remarks were brief and focused on the military's strength without mentioning \"woke.\" Source [59] (Good Morning America) notes that Trump's speech at the parade didn't include singing \"Happy Birthday\" and left festivities to the soldiers, implying he didn't delve into political rhetoric.\n\nAdditionally, source [48] (Arab News) reports on the parade and protests but doesn't mention Trump using \"woke\" in his speech. Source [62] (Arab News again) also doesn't note any such usage. Source [64] (Fox News) details the parade events but doesn't reference the term \"woke\" in Trump's speech.\n\nThere's no mention in any of the June 14 event sources that Trump used the word \"woke\" during his main speech. All references to \"woke\" are from earlier events or other contexts. Since the query specifically asks about the main speech on June 14, and the sources don't indicate he used the term there, the answer should be \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\n**Explanation:**  \nBased on the provided search results, President Donald Trump's main speech during the U.S. Army\u2019s 250th Anniversary parade on June 14, 2025, did not include the term \"woke.\" While Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth criticized \"woke\" policies in earlier events (e.g., Fort Bragg on June 11)[5][20][57], the June 14 remarks focused on military strength, patriotism, and historical tributes without invoking the term[6][42][56].

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749950160 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-15 01:16:00 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump will say \"woke\" during his main speech at the Army's 250th Anniversary event on June 14, 2025. The resolution depends on whether he uses that exact term, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. The answer needs to be based on the provided search results and the current date, which is June 15, 2025, 1:16 AM UTC.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the event happened as scheduled. The search results mention the parade took place on June 14, 2025. For example, source [1] from Fox News on June 14 says the parade kicked off, and source [6] from ABC7 on June 15 confirms the event occurred. So the event wasn't canceled, and Trump did give a speech.\n\nNext, I need to look for mentions of Trump using the word \"woke\" during his main speech at this event. Let's go through the sources. \n\nSource [5] is a transcript from Trump's speech at Fort Bragg on June 11, where Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth mentions rejecting \"woke garbage and political correctness,\" but that's a different event before the main parade. \n\nSource [20] includes a transcript of Trump's speech at Fort Bragg on June 11, where he says, \"We\u2019re getting wokeness out of our schools and out of our military, and it\u2019s already out, and it\u2019s out of our society. We don\u2019t want it. Wokeness is trouble. Wokeness is bad. It\u2019s gone. It\u2019s gone.\" But again, this is from the June 11 event, not the main June 14 speech.\n\nLooking at sources related to the June 14 parade, source [42] (ABC News) mentions Trump's remarks at the parade were brief and didn't stray into political topics. Source [56] (ABC11) also states that Trump's remarks were brief and focused on the military's strength without mentioning \"woke.\" Source [59] (Good Morning America) notes that Trump's speech at the parade didn't include singing \"Happy Birthday\" and left festivities to the soldiers, implying he didn't delve into political rhetoric.\n\nAdditionally, source [48] (Arab News) reports on the parade and protests but doesn't mention Trump using \"woke\" in his speech. Source [62] (Arab News again) also doesn't note any such usage. Source [64] (Fox News) details the parade events but doesn't reference the term \"woke\" in Trump's speech.\n\nThere's no mention in any of the June 14 event sources that Trump used the word \"woke\" during his main speech. All references to \"woke\" are from earlier events or other contexts. Since the query specifically asks about the main speech on June 14, and the sources don't indicate he used the term there, the answer should be \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\n**Explanation:**  \nBased on the provided search results, President Donald Trump's main speech during the U.S. Army\u2019s 250th Anniversary parade on June 14, 2025, did not include the term \"woke.\" While Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth criticized \"woke\" policies in earlier events (e.g., Fort Bragg on June 11)[5][20][57], the June 14 remarks focused on military strength, patriotism, and historical tributes without invoking the term[6][42][56]. The resolution conditions specify that only the main speech at the June 14 event counts, and no sources indicate its usage there.\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.0355, ID: 37502711884178434862968743977568108091004936344175864281199300269736833688796, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.9645, ID: 16900436842348167656164223733489012923786282205544188600038747421449046922611, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (0.965 = 96.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
