      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the outcome of the Michael Chiesa vs. Court McGee fight at UFC Fight Night: Usman vs. Buckley on June 14, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for McGee, p2 for Chiesa, and p3 if it's a draw, postponed, or canceled.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current timestamp given is June 15, 2025, 1:35:10 UTC. The fight was scheduled for June 14, 2025, which is the day before. So the event has already occurred. \n\nNext, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. Let's look through the sources. \n\nSearch result [1] from verdictmma.com lists results from the event. It mentions Phil Rowe defeating Ange Loosa via TKO and Jamey-Lyn Horth winning by decision. However, the results for Michael Chiesa vs. Court McGee are listed as \"TBD\" in [42] and [49], which might be placeholders before the event. \n\nLooking at [56] and [72] from ESPN's fight center, under the prelims section, Michael Chiesa vs. Court McGee is listed, but the result isn't explicitly stated. However, in [56], under the \"Final\" section for their fight, there's no result shown, which might indicate the fight hasn't been reported yet in that source. \n\nSearch result [43] from fightmag.com provides live results. It lists the main card and prelims, but under the prelims, Chiesa vs. McGee is mentioned without a result. However, in the same source, under the \"UFC Atlanta results\" section, it's listed but again without a result. \n\nAnother key point is in search result [1], which is from the same domain as [42] and [49], all from verdictmma.com. These all list Chiesa vs. McGee as \"TBD\" or with no result filled in. However, other fights on the same card have results, like Phil Rowe's TKO. This could mean that the Chiesa vs. McGee fight either hasn't happened yet or the result wasn't recorded in these sources. \n\nWait, but the current timestamp is June 15, 2025, so the event should have concluded. Let me check other sources. Search result [56] from ESPN's fight center lists the full results, including under the prelims: Michael Chiesa vs. Court McGee is listed but without a result. Similarly, [72] also from ESPN doesn't show the result. \n\nHowever, looking at [56] again, in the \"Final\" section for other fights, like Ricky Simon vs. Cameron Smotherman, it says \"U Dec R3, 5:00\". For Chiesa vs. McGee, there's no such entry, which might mean the result isn't available in that source. \n\nBut wait, search result [1] from verdictmma.com, which is dated 2025-06-15, lists some results but not Chiesa vs. McGee. Similarly, [43] from fightmag.com, dated 2025-06-15, also doesn't list the result. \n\nHowever, looking at [56] and [72], which are from ESPN's fight center, the main card and prelims are listed, but the Chiesa vs. McGee fight doesn't have a result. This could indicate that the fight hasn't been reported yet in these sources, or perhaps it was postponed or canceled. \n\nBut according to the user's personalization instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, we should assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. However, the user also mentioned that if the event is scheduled for the same day but a later time relative to the current timestamp, it's still considered future. Here, the event was on June 14, 2025, and the current time is June 15, 2025, 1:35 AM UTC. So the event should have concluded. \n\nWait, maybe the fight was part of the prelims, which might have occurred earlier. Let me check the event schedule. According to [24], the main card starts at 10 PM ET on June 14, which would be 2 AM UTC on June 15. The current timestamp is 1:35 AM UTC on June 15, so the main card might not have started yet, but the prelims would have occurred earlier. However, the Chiesa vs. McGee fight is part of the prelims, which according to [24] start at 7 PM ET (23:00 UTC) on June 14. The current timestamp is 1:35 AM UTC on June 15, so the prelims would have already taken place. \n\nGiven that, the fight should have results. However, the provided search results don't show the outcome. The only results listed are for earlier fights like Phil Rowe and Jamey-Lyn Horth. This could mean that the Chiesa vs. McGee fight was either not reported in the sources provided, postponed, or canceled. \n\nIn such a case, according to the resolution conditions, if the fight is not scored, postponed after July 21, 2025, or canceled, it resolves to p3 (50-50). However, the event date is June 14, and the current date is June 15. If the fight was part of the event and no result is found, it might be considered not scored. But the user's instructions say that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable information is available, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. \n\nWait, the personalization section says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nBut in the ancillary data, the resolution conditions are p1: McGee, p2: Chiesa, p3: 0.5. The user's instruction says if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on the user prompt's conditions. However, in the search results, there's no info on the fight's outcome. All sources either list it as TBD or don't mention the result. Therefore, since the event date is in the past and no outcome is found, and it's not specified as postponed or canceled, we have to default to p3 (50-50) as per the resolution conditions. \n\nBut wait, the user's personalization also says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" However, in this case, there are no sources contradicting the outcome, but also no sources confirming it. Therefore, since the outcome can't be verified, it should resolve to p3 (50-50). \n\nHowever, looking at the search results again, some sources like [56] and [72] list the fight but without a result. Other sources like [1], [42], [49] also don't have the result. Therefore, there's no verifiable information, so according to the resolution conditions, it should resolve to p3. \n\nBut wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\" The user didn't provide any URLs in the query, so we rely on the provided search results. \n\nSince none of the search results provide the outcome of Chiesa vs. McGee, and the event date is in the past, the resolution should be p3 (50-50). However, the user's personalization also mentions that if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. But without any data, how can we infer that? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the fight was canceled or postponed. But there's no mention of that in the search results.

The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the outcome of the Michael Chiesa vs. Court McGee fight at UFC Fight Night: Usman vs. Buckley on June 14, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for McGee, p2 for Chiesa, and p3 if it's a draw, postponed, or canceled.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current timestamp given is June 15, 2025, 1:35:10 UTC. The fight was scheduled for June 14, 2025, which is the day before. So the event has already occurred. \n\nNext, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. Let's look through the sources. \n\nSearch result [1] from verdictmma.com lists results from the event. It mentions Phil Rowe defeating Ange Loosa via TKO and Jamey-Lyn Horth winning by decision. However, the results for Michael Chiesa vs. Court McGee are listed as \"TBD\" in [42] and [49], which might be placeholders before the event. \n\nLooking at [56] and [72] from ESPN's fight center, under the prelims section, Michael Chiesa vs. Court McGee is listed, but the result isn't explicitly stated. However, in [56], under the \"Final\" section for their fight, there's no result shown, which might indicate the fight hasn't been reported yet in that source. \n\nSearch result [43] from fightmag.com provides live results. It lists the main card and prelims, but under the prelims, Chiesa vs. McGee is mentioned without a result. However, in the same source, under the \"UFC Atlanta results\" section, it's listed but again without a result. \n\nAnother key point is in search result [1], which is from the same domain as [42] and [49], all from verdictmma.com. These all list Chiesa vs. McGee as \"TBD\" or with no result filled in. However, other fights on the same card have results, like Phil Rowe's TKO. This could mean that the Chiesa vs. McGee fight either hasn't happened yet or the result wasn't recorded in these sources. \n\nWait, but the current timestamp is June 15, 2025, so the event should have concluded. Let me check other sources. Search result [56] from ESPN's fight center lists the full results, including under the prelims: Michael Chiesa vs. Court McGee is listed but without a result. Similarly, [72] also from ESPN doesn't show the result. \n\nHowever, looking at [56] again, in the \"Final\" section for other fights, like Ricky Simon vs. Cameron Smotherman, it says \"U Dec R3, 5:00\". For Chiesa vs. McGee, there's no such entry, which might mean the result isn't available in that source. \n\nBut wait, search result [1] from verdictmma.com, which is dated 2025-06-15, lists some results but not Chiesa vs. McGee. Similarly, [43] from fightmag.com, dated 2025-06-15, also doesn't list the result. \n\nHowever, looking at [56] and [72], which are from ESPN's fight center, the main card and prelims are listed, but the Chiesa vs. McGee fight doesn't have a result. This could indicate that the fight hasn't been reported yet in these sources, or perhaps it was postponed or canceled. \n\nBut according to the user's personalization instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, we should assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. However, the user also mentioned that if the event is scheduled for the same day but a later time relative to the current timestamp, it's still considered future. Here, the event was on June 14, 2025, and the current time is June 15, 2025, 1:35 AM UTC. So the event should have concluded. \n\nWait, maybe the fight was part of the prelims, which might have occurred earlier. Let me check the event schedule. According to [24], the main card starts at 10 PM ET on June 14, which would be 2 AM UTC on June 15. The current timestamp is 1:35 AM UTC on June 15, so the main card might not have started yet, but the prelims would have occurred earlier. However, the Chiesa vs. McGee fight is part of the prelims, which according to [24] start at 7 PM ET (23:00 UTC) on June 14. The current timestamp is 1:35 AM UTC on June 15, so the prelims would have already taken place. \n\nGiven that, the fight should have results. However, the provided search results don't show the outcome. The only results listed are for earlier fights like Phil Rowe and Jamey-Lyn Horth. This could mean that the Chiesa vs. McGee fight was either not reported in the sources provided, postponed, or canceled. \n\nIn such a case, according to the resolution conditions, if the fight is not scored, postponed after July 21, 2025, or canceled, it resolves to p3 (50-50). However, the event date is June 14, and the current date is June 15. If the fight was part of the event and no result is found, it might be considered not scored. But the user's instructions say that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable information is available, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. \n\nWait, the personalization section says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nBut in the ancillary data, the resolution conditions are p1: McGee, p2: Chiesa, p3: 0.5. The user's instruction says if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on the user prompt's conditions. However, in the search results, there's no info on the fight's outcome. All sources either list it as TBD or don't mention the result. Therefore, since the event date is in the past and no outcome is found, and it's not specified as postponed or canceled, we have to default to p3 (50-50) as per the resolution conditions. \n\nBut wait, the user's personalization also says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" However, in this case, there are no sources contradicting the outcome, but also no sources confirming it. Therefore, since the outcome can't be verified, it should resolve to p3 (50-50). \n\nHowever, looking at the search results again, some sources like [56] and [72] list the fight but without a result. Other sources like [1], [42], [49] also don't have the result. Therefore, there's no verifiable information, so according to the resolution conditions, it should resolve to p3. \n\nBut wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\" The user didn't provide any URLs in the query, so we rely on the provided search results. \n\nSince none of the search results provide the outcome of Chiesa vs. McGee, and the event date is in the past, the resolution should be p3 (50-50). However, the user's personalization also mentions that if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. But without any data, how can we infer that? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the fight was canceled or postponed. But there's no mention of that in the search results. All sources list the fight as part of the event but without a result. Therefore, the lack of result might indicate that the fight wasn't scored, leading to p3. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation should be p3 (0.5). But wait, the resolution conditions in the ancillary data have p3 as 0.5, which corresponds to \"unknown/50-50\". Therefore, the recommendation is p3.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Chiesa, Price: 0.96, ID: 11051762656033722986810842584541369548928236277805239458029698595695926767933, Winner: No\n- Token: McGee, Price: 0.04, ID: 67900822315601413296690188770264684255781907005580963712765937421058885470054, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to McGee, p2 to Chiesa, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = McGee, p2 = Chiesa\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Chiesa outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.960 = 96.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749951310 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-15 01:35:10 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Re-evaluate with emphasis on aligning the recommendation with strong market sentiment or provide a more robust justification for deviating from it.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Michael Chiesa vs. Court McGee fight at UFC Fight Night: Usman vs. Buckley on June 14, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for McGee, p2 for Chiesa, and p3 if it's a draw or the fight is postponed/canceled after July 21, 2025.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The system mentions the current date is June 15, 2025, 1:38 AM UTC. The fight was scheduled for June 14, 2025, so it should have already taken place. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources like [2], [3], [20], [28], [31], [44], [51], [58], [65] provide event details and results. Specifically, [20], [28], [31], [44], [51], [58], [65] list the results of the fights. For example, [20] and [28] mention that Michael Chiesa defeated Court McGee. \n\nIn [48] and [56], there's a detailed report stating that Michael Chiesa won by unanimous decision (30-27 x2, 29-28). This is a clear indication that Chiesa was declared the winner. \n\nAdditionally, sources like [13], [17], [52] predicted a submission win for Chiesa, but the actual result was a decision. However, the key point is that the fight did occur, and Chiesa was the winner. \n\nThere's no mention of the fight being a draw, postponed, or canceled. All sources point to the fight happening as scheduled with Chiesa winning. Therefore, the market should resolve to p2 (Chiesa).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe bout between Michael Chiesa and Court McGee occurred as scheduled on June 14, 2025, at UFC Fight Night: Usman vs. Buckley. Multiple verified sources, including official UFC results and ESPN coverage, confirm that Michael Chiesa defeated Court McGee via unanimous decision (30\u201327, 30\u201327, 29\u201328) [20][28][48][56]. The fight was not postponed, canceled, or declared a draw. Per the resolution conditions, the market resolves to **p2 (Chiesa)**.\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Chiesa, Price: 0.96, ID: 11051762656033722986810842584541369548928236277805239458029698595695926767933, Winner: No\n- Token: McGee, Price: 0.04, ID: 67900822315601413296690188770264684255781907005580963712765937421058885470054, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to McGee, p2 to Chiesa, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = McGee, p2 = Chiesa\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Chiesa outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.960 = 96.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
