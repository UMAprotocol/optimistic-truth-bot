Let's go through each source to find any events in that timeframe. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention Israeli airstrikes on May 28. For example, source [1] says Israel launched four airstrikes on Sana'a airport on May 28. Source [10] also mentions the May 28 airstrikes, and source [12] details the attack on the same day, calling it Operation Golden Jewel. Source [14] confirms the IDF conducted four airstrikes on May 28, destroying the last operational plane. \n\nAdditionally, source [8] from June 3 mentions an interception on June 1, but that's outside the May 28-31 window. The key events are on May 28. The user's ancillary data defines military action as any use of force acknowledged by Israel or credible reports. The May 28 attacks are well-documented across multiple credible sources, including official IDF statements. \n\nSince the airstrikes occurred within the specified timeframe and meet the criteria, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2). There's no ambiguity here as multiple sources confirm the action, and it's within the date range.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The user wants to know if there was an Israeli military action in Yemen between May 28, 3:00 PM ET, and May 31, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The resolution depends on credible reports of such actions.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. Let's go through each source to find any events in that timeframe. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention Israeli airstrikes on May 28. For example, source [1] says Israel launched four airstrikes on Sana'a airport on May 28. Source [10] also mentions the May 28 airstrikes, and source [12] details the attack on the same day, calling it Operation Golden Jewel. Source [14] confirms the IDF conducted four airstrikes on May 28, destroying the last operational plane. \n\nAdditionally, source [8] from June 3 mentions an interception on June 1, but that's outside the May 28-31 window. The key events are on May 28. The user's ancillary data defines military action as any use of force acknowledged by Israel or credible reports. The May 28 attacks are well-documented across multiple credible sources, including official IDF statements. \n\nSince the airstrikes occurred within the specified timeframe and meet the criteria, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2). There's no ambiguity here as multiple sources confirm the action, and it's within the date range.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0, ID: 104009582873679856205140868824403934115637030037518004655205010086821050620, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 1, ID: 57131259521086789307123894868082778634487241045776363383203860306700227262584, Winner: Yes\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The user is asking whether Israel initiated a military action on Yemeni soil, airspace, or maritime territory between May 28, 3:00 PM ET, and May 31, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if there's an official acknowledgment or credible reports of such actions. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. Let's go through each source to find relevant events within the specified timeframe. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention Israeli airstrikes on Yemen in May 2025. Specifically, result [1] from Human Rights Watch on June 3, 2025, details Israeli airstrikes on Sanaa International Airport on May 6 and May 28. The May 28 attack is within the user's date range (May 28 to May 31). The attack destroyed the last operational Yemenia Airways plane and damaged the airport. \n\nResult [3] from Peoples Dispatch on May 31, 2025, confirms the May 28 attack, stating Israel launched four airstrikes on Sanaa airport, destroying the last operational airplane. This is within the timeframe. \n\nResult [6] from Wikipedia's \"May 2025 Israeli attacks on Yemen\" lists an attack on May 28 where Israeli forces bombed Sanaa International Airport again, destroying the last Yemenia plane. This is directly within the specified period. \n\nResult [14] from Israel Hayom on May 28, 2025, reports the Israeli Air Force executed airstrikes on Houthi-controlled infrastructure at Sanaa airport, part of Operation Golden Jewel. The date matches exactly. \n\nResult [16] from ABC News on May 28, 2025, mentions Israeli airstrikes targeting Sanaa International Airport, with the IDF stating they targeted the central airport and a Houthi aircraft. \n\nResult [17] from TradingView on May 28, 2025, notes the Israeli air force hit Houthi targets at Sanaa airport as per the defense ministry. \n\nResult [18] from the Institute for the Study of War on May 29, 2025, details IDF airstrikes on May 28 that destroyed the airport's runway and the last operational Yemenia airplane, citing credible reports. \n\nAll these sources confirm that on May 28, 2025, Israel conducted airstrikes on Sanaa International Airport in Yemen. The timeframe specified by the user starts on May 28 at 3:00 PM ET. The attacks on May 28 occurred in the morning (local time in Yemen, which is UTC+3), so converting to ET, that would be early morning ET on May 28. However, the user's window starts at 3:00 PM ET on May 28. \n\nWait, need to check the exact timing. The May 28 attack is mentioned in [1] as occurring in the morning, with the plane scheduled to fly at 9:30 AM local time (Yemen is UTC+3). Converting 9:30 AM Yemen time to ET: Yemen is 7 hours ahead of ET. So 9:30 AM in Yemen would be 2:30 AM ET. That's before 3:00 PM ET on May 28. Hmm, this might be an issue. \n\nBut looking at result [3], the attack on May 28 is described as happening on Wednesday, May 28, with the plane scheduled to fly to Saudi Arabia for Hajj. The article is dated May 31, 2025, so the event is within the timeframe. However, the exact time of the airstrike needs to be confirmed. \n\nResult [1] mentions the attack on May 28 happened in the morning, with the plane landing at 9:28 AM local time and the attack occurring between 10:15 and 11:00 AM local time. Converting 10:15 AM Yemen time to ET: 10:15 AM UTC+3 is 3:15 AM ET. So the attack occurred at 3:15 AM ET on May 28, which is before the market's start time of 3:00 PM ET on May 28. \n\nWait, that's a problem. The market's timeframe starts at 3:00 PM ET on May 28. If the attack was at 3:15 AM ET on May 28, that's 12 hours before the market's start. Therefore, this attack wouldn't fall within the specified window. \n\nBut wait, let's check other sources. Result [6] (Wikipedia) mentions the May 28 attack as part of the May 2025 Israeli attacks, but doesn't specify the exact time. Result [14] (Israel Hayom) states the airstrike was on May 28, but again, time isn't specified. Result [16] (ABC News) also mentions the strike on May 28 without a specific time. \n\nHowever, result [18] (Institute for the Study of War) from May 29, 2025, states the IDF conducted airstrikes on May 28, destroying the runway and the last plane. If the attack was on May 28, but before 3:00 PM ET, then it's outside the market's window. \n\nBut the user's query is about military actions between May 28, 3:00 PM ET, and May 31. If all the reported strikes on May 28 occurred before 3:00 PM ET, then there's no action within the window. However, I need to check if there were any actions after 3:00 PM ET on May 28 through May 31. \n\nLooking through the search results, after May 28, the next mentioned event is on June 2 and 3 (results [7], [12], [17]), where Israel intercepted missiles from Yemen and the Houthis claimed attacks. However, these are Houthi actions, not Israeli military actions on Yemen. \n\nResult [7] from June 3 mentions Israel carrying out strikes in Yemen, including on ports and Sanaa airport, but the date of these strikes isn't specified beyond \"several strikes in May\". The most recent strikes mentioned in the results are on May 28. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided sources, the only Israeli military actions in Yemen during May 2025 are the May 5, 6, 16, and 28 strikes. The May 28 strike occurred before 3:00 PM ET, so it's outside the market's window. \n\nBut wait, the user's ancillary data says the market resolves to \"Yes\" if the action happens between May 28, 3:00 PM ET, and May 31. If there's no action in that window, then it's \"No\". However, the user's previous response was p2 (Yes), and they're asking to try again. \n\nWait, perhaps I missed an action within the window. Let me recheck. \n\nResult [17] from May 28, 2025, at 00:27 GMT-7 (which is 7:27 AM UTC, so May 28, 7:27 AM UTC). The article states the Israeli air force hit Houthi targets at Sanaa airport on May 28. If the attack happened on May 28, but the exact time is unclear. If the attack was after 3:00 PM ET (which is 19:00 UTC), then it's within the window. But the sources mention the attack was in the morning local time, which would be early morning ET. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another strike on May 29 or 30. Let me check all results again. \n\nResult [18] from May 29 mentions the May 28 strikes but doesn't report any actions after that. Results [7], [12], and [17] from June mention Houthi attacks and Israeli interceptions, but no Israeli strikes on Yemen after May 28. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided data, there's no Israeli military action on Yemen within the specified timeframe (May 28, 3:00 PM ET, to May 31). The May 28 strike was before the window. Hence, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). \n\nBut the user says the previous response was p2 (Yes), so maybe there's a misunderstanding. Perhaps the May 28 strike is considered within the window if the local time in Yemen is considered. However, the market uses ET. The strike on May 28 at 3:15 AM ET is before 3:00 PM ET on May 28, so it's outside. \n\nTherefore, the correct resolution should be \"No\" (p1). But the user wants to check again. Maybe there's another action. Let me check result [14] again. It mentions on May 28, the IDF launched airstrikes as part of Operation Golden Jewel. If the time of the strike was after 3:00 PM ET, then it's within the window. But the sources don't specify the exact time. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the market's start time is May 28, 3:00 PM ET, and any action on May 28 after that time would count. If the strike was on May 28 in Yemen but after 3:00 PM ET, it would be within the window. However, Yemen is UTC+3, so 3:00 PM ET is 10:00 PM Yemen time. If the strike happened after 10:00 PM Yemen time on May 28, it would be within the window. \n\nBut according to result [1], the May 28 attack occurred in the morning in Yemen, which is before 10:00 PM local time. Therefore, the strike was before the market's start time. \n\nThus, there's no Israeli military action in Yemen during the specified window. The correct resolution is \"No\" (p1). The previous response of p2 was incorrect, so the user is asking to re-evaluate. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation should be p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The date matches exactly. \n\nResult [16] from ABC News on May 28, 2025, mentions Israeli airstrikes targeting Sanaa International Airport, with the IDF stating they targeted the central airport and a Houthi aircraft. \n\nResult [17] from TradingView on May 28, 2025, notes the Israeli air force hit Houthi targets at Sanaa airport as per the defense ministry. \n\nResult [18] from the Institute for the Study of War on May 29, 2025, details IDF airstrikes on May 28 that destroyed the airport's runway and the last operational Yemenia airplane, citing credible reports. \n\nAll these sources confirm that on May 28, 2025, Israel conducted airstrikes on Sanaa International Airport in Yemen. The timeframe specified by the user starts on May 28 at 3:00 PM ET. The attacks on May 28 occurred in the morning (local time in Yemen, which is UTC+3), so converting to ET, that would be early morning ET on May 28. However, the user's window starts at 3:00 PM ET on May 28. \n\nWait, need to check the exact timing. The May 28 attack is mentioned in [1] as occurring in the morning, with the plane scheduled to fly at 9:30 AM local time (Yemen is UTC+3). Converting 9:30 AM Yemen time to ET: Yemen is 7 hours ahead of ET. So 9:30 AM in Yemen would be 2:30 AM ET. That's before 3:00 PM ET on May 28. Hmm, this might be an issue. \n\nBut looking at result [3], the attack on May 28 is described as happening on Wednesday, May 28, with the plane scheduled to fly to Saudi Arabia for Hajj. The article is dated May 31, 2025, so the event is within the timeframe. However, the exact time of the airstrike needs to be confirmed. \n\nResult [1] mentions the attack on May 28 happened in the morning, with the plane landing at 9:28 AM local time and the attack occurring between 10:15 and 11:00 AM local time. Converting 10:15 AM Yemen time to ET: 10:15 AM UTC+3 is 3:15 AM ET. So the attack occurred at 3:15 AM ET on May 28, which is before the market's start time of 3:00 PM ET on May 28. \n\nWait, that's a problem. The market's timeframe starts at 3:00 PM ET on May 28. If the attack was at 3:15 AM ET on May 28, that's 12 hours before the market's start. Therefore, this attack wouldn't fall within the specified window. \n\nBut wait, let's check other sources. Result [6] (Wikipedia) mentions the May 28 attack as part of the May 2025 Israeli attacks, but doesn't specify the exact time. Result [14] (Israel Hayom) states the airstrike was on May 28, but again, time isn't specified. Result [16] (ABC News) also mentions the strike on May 28 without a specific time. \n\nHowever, result [18] (Institute for the Study of War) from May 29, 2025, states the IDF conducted airstrikes on May 28, destroying the runway and the last plane. If the attack was on May 28, but before 3:00 PM ET, then it's outside the market's window. \n\nBut the user's query is about military actions between May 28, 3:00 PM ET, and May 31. If all the reported strikes on May 28 occurred before 3:00 PM ET, then there's no action within the window. However, I need to check if there were any actions after 3:00 PM ET on May 28 through May 31. \n\nLooking through the search results, after May 28, the next mentioned event is on June 2 and 3 (results [7], [12], [17]), where Israel intercepted missiles from Yemen and the Houthis claimed attacks. However, these are Houthi actions, not Israeli military actions on Yemen. \n\nResult [7] from June 3 mentions Israel carrying out strikes in Yemen, including on ports and Sanaa airport, but the date of these strikes isn't specified beyond \"several strikes in May\". The most recent strikes mentioned in the results are on May 28. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided sources, the only Israeli military actions in Yemen during May 2025 are the May 5, 6, 16, and 28 strikes. The May 28 strike occurred before 3:00 PM ET, so it's outside the market's window. \n\nBut wait, the user's ancillary data says the market resolves to \"Yes\" if the action happens between May 28, 3:00 PM ET, and May 31. If there's no action in that window, then it's \"No\". However, the user's previous response was p2 (Yes), and they're asking to try again. \n\nWait, perhaps I missed an action within the window. Let me recheck. \n\nResult [17] from May 28, 2025, at 00:27 GMT-7 (which is 7:27 AM UTC, so May 28, 7:27 AM UTC). The article states the Israeli air force hit Houthi targets at Sanaa airport on May 28. If the attack happened on May 28, but the exact time is unclear. If the attack was after 3:00 PM ET (which is 19:00 UTC), then it's within the window. But the sources mention the attack was in the morning local time, which would be early morning ET. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another strike on May 29 or 30. Let me check all results again. \n\nResult [18] from May 29 mentions the May 28 strikes but doesn't report any actions after that. Results [7], [12], and [17] from June mention Houthi attacks and Israeli interceptions, but no Israeli strikes on Yemen after May 28. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided data, there's no Israeli military action on Yemen within the specified timeframe (May 28, 3:00 PM ET, to May 31). The May 28 strike was before the window. Hence, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). \n\nBut the user says the previous response was p2 (Yes), so maybe there's a misunderstanding. Perhaps the May 28 strike is considered within the window if the local time in Yemen is considered. However, the market uses ET. The strike on May 28 at 3:15 AM ET is before 3:00 PM ET on May 28, so it's outside. \n\nTherefore, the correct resolution should be \"No\" (p1). But the user wants to check again. Maybe there's another action. Let me check result [14] again. It mentions on May 28, the IDF launched airstrikes as part of Operation Golden Jewel. If the time of the strike was after 3:00 PM ET, then it's within the window. But the sources don't specify the exact time. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the market's start time is May 28, 3:00 PM ET, and any action on May 28 after that time would count. If the strike was on May 28 in Yemen but after 3:00 PM ET, it would be within the window. However, Yemen is UTC+3, so 3:00 PM ET is 10:00 PM Yemen time. If the strike happened after 10:00 PM Yemen time on May 28, it would be within the window. \n\nBut according to result [1], the May 28 attack occurred in the morning in Yemen, which is before 10:00 PM local time. Therefore, the strike was before the market's start time. \n\nThus, there's no Israeli military action in Yemen during the specified window. The correct resolution is \"No\" (p1). The previous response of p2 was incorrect, so the user is asking to re-evaluate. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation should be p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0, ID: 104009582873679856205140868824403934115637030037518004655205010086821050620, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 1, ID: 57131259521086789307123894868082778634487241045776363383203860306700227262584, Winner: Yes\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
