      "response": "<think>\nWe are given a query about whether ByteDance announced their intention to sell TikTok by June 19, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if such an announcement was made, \"No\" (p1) if not, and \"unknown/50-50\" (p3) if the outcome is unclear.\n\nWe have search results from various sources, including news articles and official statements, up to June 20, 2025. We must determine if there was an announcement by the deadline.\n\nKey points from the search results:\n\n1. The original deadline set by the U.S. law (Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act) was January 19, 2025, for ByteDance to divest TikTok or face a ban. This deadline was extended multiple times by President Trump.\n\n2. On June 19, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order extending the deadline for the third time, giving ByteDance until September 17, 2025, to sell TikTok. This is reported in multiple sources (e.g., [1][2][3][5][13][15][17][34][42]).\n\n3. There is no mention in any of the search results of ByteDance making an announcement of their intention to sell TikTok by June 19, 2025. Instead, the focus is on the extensions granted by Trump and the ongoing negotiations.\n\n4. ByteDance has consistently stated that they do not intend to sell TikTok. For example, in April 2024, after President Biden signed the ban into law, ByteDance stated they had no plans to sell TikTok ([7][12][40]). There is no indication in the more recent search results (up to June 20, 2025) that they changed their position.\n\n5. The search results from June 19 and 20, 2025, only discuss the extension and the lack of a sale. For instance:\n   - Axios reports: \"ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese-owned parent company, has failed to sell the app to a U.S. buyer as required by the law.\" ([13][34])\n   - Fox Business: \"TikTok has yet to announce a buyer for its U.S. business, according to Reuters.\" ([3][17][42])\n   - NBC Palm Springs: \"President Trump has extended the deadline for TikTok's Chinese parent company to sell the app to a U.S. buyer. ByteDance now has 90 more days...\" ([6][33][43])\n\n6. The executive order from April 4, 2025, extended the deadline to June 19, 2025 ([11][16][18][22][29][31][38][45]). However, by June 19, no sale was announced, leading to another extension.\n\n7. The user's query specifies that the announcement must be made by June 19, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The search results do not report any such announcement by ByteDance on or before that date.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, ByteDance did not announce their intention to sell TikTok by the deadline. The market should resolve to \"No\" (p1).\n\nNote: The ancillary data defines the resolution conditions: p1 for No, p2 for Yes, p3 for unknown. Since the outcome is clear (no announcement), we resolve to p1.\n\nFinal recommendation: p1\n</think>\nBased on the provided search results and the resolution conditions, I have analyzed whether ByteDance announced their intention to sell TikTok by the June 19, 2025 deadline. The evidence shows:\n\n1. **No announcement of sale intention**: None of the 46 search results contain any statement from ByteDance announcing plans to sell TikTok. ByteDance consistently maintained its refusal to sell, as evidenced by their April 2024 statement: \"ByteDance holds no intentions to sell TikTok\" [7][12][40]. This position remained unchanged through June 2025.\n\n2. **Deadline extensions**: President Trump issued three executive orders (January 20, April 4, and June 19, 2025) extending the divestment deadline [2][11][16][18][22][29][31][38][45]. The June 19 extension specifically pushed the deadline to September 17, 2025 [2][3][5][15][17][34][42], confirming no sale announcement occurred by the original cutoff.\n\n3. **Ongoing negotiations without commitment**: While potential buyers like Oracle, Amazon, and investor groups expressed interest [1][4][27][35], ByteDance only acknowledged \"discussions with the US government\" [4][39] without announcing any sale intent. Negotiations stalled in April 2025 after U.S. tariff announcements [4][13][35].\n\n4. **Chinese regulatory barriers**: Any sale would require Chinese government approval [1][26][35][39], which was explicitly withheld following U.S. tariff announcements in April 2025 [4][13][35]. Chinese officials stated they \"would not support a deal\" [1][26].\n\n5. **Verified absence of announcement**: Multiple June 19-20, 2025 reports from Reuters, Axios, CBS, and Fox Business confirm ByteDance missed the deadline without announcing sale plans [3][5][13][17][34][42]. TikTok's June 19 statement only thanked Trump for the extension [3][17], not any sale intention.\n\n**Conclusion**: ByteDance did not announce any intention to sell TikTok by the June 19, 2025 deadline. The resolution condition for \"No\" (p1) is met.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: TikTok sale announced by June 19?, description: On April 4, Donald Trump issued a new executive order titled \"Extending the TikTok Enforcement Delay.\" You can find that executive order here: https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/extending-the-tiktok-enforcement-delay/\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if ByteDance announces their intention to sell TikTok by June 19, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. Otherwise this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nA public announcement of the intention to sell TikTok will qualify even if a sale has not been finalized. This includes any formal declaration made by ByteDance or its authorized representatives regarding their plans to sell or transfer ownership of TikTok.\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be official information from ByteDance. However, a consensus of credible reporting may also be used.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750392160 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-20 04:02:40 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nWe are given a query about whether ByteDance announced their intention to sell TikTok by June 19, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if such an announcement was made, \"No\" (p1) if not, and \"unknown/50-50\" (p3) if the outcome is unclear.\n\nWe have search results from various sources, including news articles and official statements, up to June 20, 2025. We must determine if there was an announcement by the deadline.\n\nKey points from the search results:\n\n1. The original deadline set by the U.S. law (Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act) was January 19, 2025, for ByteDance to divest TikTok or face a ban. This deadline was extended multiple times by President Trump.\n\n2. On June 19, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order extending the deadline for the third time, giving ByteDance until September 17, 2025, to sell TikTok. This is reported in multiple sources (e.g., [1][2][3][5][13][15][17][34][42]).\n\n3. There is no mention in any of the search results of ByteDance making an announcement of their intention to sell TikTok by June 19, 2025. Instead, the focus is on the extensions granted by Trump and the ongoing negotiations.\n\n4. ByteDance has consistently stated that they do not intend to sell TikTok. For example, in April 2024, after President Biden signed the ban into law, ByteDance stated they had no plans to sell TikTok ([7][12][40]). There is no indication in the more recent search results (up to June 20, 2025) that they changed their position.\n\n5. The search results from June 19 and 20, 2025, only discuss the extension and the lack of a sale. For instance:\n   - Axios reports: \"ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese-owned parent company, has failed to sell the app to a U.S. buyer as required by the law.\" ([13][34])\n   - Fox Business: \"TikTok has yet to announce a buyer for its U.S. business, according to Reuters.\" ([3][17][42])\n   - NBC Palm Springs: \"President Trump has extended the deadline for TikTok's Chinese parent company to sell the app to a U.S. buyer. ByteDance now has 90 more days...\" ([6][33][43])\n\n6. The executive order from April 4, 2025, extended the deadline to June 19, 2025 ([11][16][18][22][29][31][38][45]). However, by June 19, no sale was announced, leading to another extension.\n\n7. The user's query specifies that the announcement must be made by June 19, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The search results do not report any such announcement by ByteDance on or before that date.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, ByteDance did not announce their intention to sell TikTok by the deadline. The market should resolve to \"No\" (p1).\n\nNote: The ancillary data defines the resolution conditions: p1 for No, p2 for Yes, p3 for unknown. Since the outcome is clear (no announcement), we resolve to p1.\n\nFinal recommendation: p1\n</think>\nBased on the provided search results and the resolution conditions, I have analyzed whether ByteDance announced their intention to sell TikTok by the June 19, 2025 deadline. The evidence shows:\n\n1. **No announcement of sale intention**: None of the 46 search results contain any statement from ByteDance announcing plans to sell TikTok. ByteDance consistently maintained its refusal to sell, as evidenced by their April 2024 statement: \"ByteDance holds no intentions to sell TikTok\" [7][12][40]. This position remained unchanged through June 2025.\n\n2. **Deadline extensions**: President Trump issued three executive orders (January 20, April 4, and June 19, 2025) extending the divestment deadline [2][11][16][18][22][29][31][38][45]. The June 19 extension specifically pushed the deadline to September 17, 2025 [2][3][5][15][17][34][42], confirming no sale announcement occurred by the original cutoff.\n\n3. **Ongoing negotiations without commitment**: While potential buyers like Oracle, Amazon, and investor groups expressed interest [1][4][27][35], ByteDance only acknowledged \"discussions with the US government\" [4][39] without announcing any sale intent. Negotiations stalled in April 2025 after U.S. tariff announcements [4][13][35].\n\n4. **Chinese regulatory barriers**: Any sale would require Chinese government approval [1][26][35][39], which was explicitly withheld following U.S. tariff announcements in April 2025 [4][13][35]. Chinese officials stated they \"would not support a deal\" [1][26].\n\n5. **Verified absence of announcement**: Multiple June 19-20, 2025 reports from Reuters, Axios, CBS, and Fox Business confirm ByteDance missed the deadline without announcing sale plans [3][5][13][17][34][42]. TikTok's June 19 statement only thanked Trump for the extension [3][17], not any sale intention.\n\n**Conclusion**: ByteDance did not announce any intention to sell TikTok by the June 19, 2025 deadline. The resolution condition for \"No\" (p1) is met.\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.0005, ID: 43011730263963497914433809796052562429587073056340590027365874725133275747980, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.9995, ID: 104845499588622770101729606789611512135417250462264840000155265940870031716085, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
