Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\"), college football (e.g., \"What was the score of the Alabama game last Saturday?\"), college basketball (e.g., \"What was Duke's score in their last game?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.

Try the proxy endpoint first (better reliability)\n       2. If proxy fails (timeout, error response, etc.), automatically fall back to the primary endpoint\n       3. Your code MUST handle this gracefully with try/except blocks\n\n     Example fallback code structure:\n     ```python\n     def get_data(symbol, start_time, end_time):\n         try:\n             # First try the proxy endpoint\n             response = requests.get(f\"{proxy_url}?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n         except Exception as e:\n             print(f\"Proxy endpoint failed: {str(e)}, falling back to primary endpoint\")\n             # Fall back to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n             response = requests.get(f\"{primary_url}/klines?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n     ```\n     \n6. NEVER include actual API key values in the code, always load them from environment variables.\n\n7. IMPORTANT FOR ALL DATA SOURCES: If a proxy endpoint is provided alongside a primary endpoint, you MUST implement the fallback mechanism described above. This is critical for reliability:\n   - Always try the proxy endpoint first\n   - If the proxy fails, fall back to the primary endpoint\n   - Use appropriate timeout values (10 seconds recommended)\n   - Include proper error handling with try/except blocks\n\nThe code should be completely self-contained and runnable with no arguments.\n\n\nHere's a complete code example that shows how to solve this type of problem:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Note: Binance public API doesn't require an API key for basic price queries\n# However, if we need rate limits increased or private endpoints, we would use these:\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\nBINANCE_API_SECRET = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\")\n\n# Sensitive data patterns to mask in logs\nSENSITIVE_PATTERNS = [\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_KEY\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    #

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Bitcoin Up or Down - June 14, 2 PM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for BTC/USDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTC/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT).

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749927645 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-14 19:00:45 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# API keys loaded from environment variables\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\n\n# Configure logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\nhandler = logging.StreamHandler()\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nhandler.setFormatter(formatter)\nlogger.addHandler(handler)\n\ndef get_binance_price(symbol, interval, start_time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches price data from Binance API for a given symbol and interval at a specific start time.\n    \"\"\"\n    proxy_url = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\"\n    primary_url = \"https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines\"\n    \n    params = {\n        \"symbol\": symbol,\n        \"interval\": interval,\n        \"limit\": 1,\n        \"startTime\": start_time,\n        \"endTime\": start_time + 3600000  # 1 hour later\n    }\n    \n    try:\n        # Try proxy endpoint first\n        response = requests.get(proxy_url, params=params, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n        if data:\n            return float(data[0][4])  # Close price of the candle\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Proxy failed, trying primary endpoint: {e}\")\n        try:\n            # Fallback to primary endpoint\n            response = requests.get(primary_url, params=params, timeout=10)\n            response.raise_for_status()\n            data = response.json()\n            if data:\n                return float(data[0][4])  # Close price of the candle\n        except Exception as e:\n            logger.error(f\"Both proxy and primary endpoints failed: {e}\")\n            raise\n\ndef resolve_market():\n    \"\"\"\n    Resolves the market based on the price change of BTC/USDT on Binance at a specific time.\n    \"\"\"\n    symbol = \"BTCUSDT\"\n    interval = \"1h\"\n    target_time = datetime(2025, 6, 14, 14, 0, 0, tzinfo=pytz.timezone(\"US/Eastern\"))\n    target_time_utc = target_time.astimezone(pytz.utc)\n    start_time = int(target_time_utc.timestamp() * 1000)  # Convert to milliseconds\n    \n    try:\n        price_start = get_binance_price(symbol, interval, start_time)\n        price_end = get_binance_price(symbol, interval, start_time + 3600000)  # Next hour candle\n        \n        if price_end >= price_start:\n            logger.info(\"Market resolves to Up.\")\n            return \"recommendation: p2\"  # Up\n        else:\n            logger.info(\"Market resolves to Down.\")\n            return \"recommendation: p1\"  # Down\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Error resolving market: {e}\")\n        return \"recommendation: p3\"  # Unknown/50-50 if error occurs\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    result = resolve_market()\n    print(result)\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p3\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.981 = 98.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Try the proxy endpoint first (better reliability)\n       2. If proxy fails (timeout, error response, etc.), automatically fall back to the primary endpoint\n       3. Your code MUST handle this gracefully with try/except blocks\n\n     Example fallback code structure:\n     ```python\n     def get_data(symbol, start_time, end_time):\n         try:\n             # First try the proxy endpoint\n             response = requests.get(f\"{proxy_url}?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n         except Exception as e:\n             print(f\"Proxy endpoint failed: {str(e)}, falling back to primary endpoint\")\n             # Fall back to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n             response = requests.get(f\"{primary_url}/klines?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n     ```\n     \n6. NEVER include actual API key values in the code, always load them from environment variables.\n\n7. IMPORTANT FOR ALL DATA SOURCES: If a proxy endpoint is provided alongside a primary endpoint, you MUST implement the fallback mechanism described above. This is critical for reliability:\n   - Always try the proxy endpoint first\n   - If the proxy fails, fall back to the primary endpoint\n   - Use appropriate timeout values (10 seconds recommended)\n   - Include proper error handling with try/except blocks\n\nThe code should be completely self-contained and runnable with no arguments.\n\n\nHere's a complete code example that shows how to solve this type of problem:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Note: Binance public API doesn't require an API key for basic price queries\n# However, if we need rate limits increased or private endpoints, we would use these:\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\nBINANCE_API_SECRET = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\")\n\n# Sensitive data patterns to mask in logs\nSENSITIVE_PATTERNS = [\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_KEY\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    #

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Bitcoin Up or Down - June 14, 2 PM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for BTC/USDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTC/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTC/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 551821\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749927645 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-14 19:00:45 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p3. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# API keys loaded from environment variables\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\n\n# API endpoints\nPRIMARY_API_URL = \"https://api.binance.com/api/v3\"\nPROXY_API_URL = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\"\n\ndef fetch_price_data(symbol, interval, start_time, end_time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches price data from Binance API with a fallback to a proxy server.\n    \"\"\"\n    params = {\n        \"symbol\": symbol,\n        \"interval\": interval,\n        \"limit\": 1,\n        \"startTime\": start_time,\n        \"endTime\": end_time\n    }\n    try:\n        # Try fetching data from the proxy endpoint\n        response = requests.get(f\"{PROXY_API_URL}/klines\", params=params, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n        if data:\n            return data[0]\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Proxy failed with error: {e}, falling back to primary API.\")\n        try:\n            # Fallback to the primary API endpoint\n            response = requests.get(f\"{PRIMARY_API_URL}/klines\", params=params, timeout=10)\n            response.raise_for_status()\n            data = response.json()\n            if data:\n                return data[0]\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"Primary API also failed with error: {e}\")\n            return None\n\ndef get_candle_data(symbol, target_datetime):\n    \"\"\"\n    Retrieves the closing price of a specific 1-hour candle for the given datetime.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert datetime to milliseconds\n    start_time = int(target_datetime.timestamp() * 1000)\n    end_time = start_time + 3600000  # 1 hour later in milliseconds\n\n    # Fetch the candle data\n    candle_data = fetch_price_data(symbol, \"1h\", start_time, end_time)\n    if candle_data:\n        return {\n            \"open\": float(candle_data[1]),\n            \"close\": float(candle_data[4]),\n            \"high\": float(candle_data[2]),\n            \"low\": float(candle_data[3]),\n            \"volume\": float(candle_data[5])\n        }\n    else:\n        return None\n\ndef main():\n    # Define the target datetime in Eastern Time\n    target_datetime_str = \"2025-06-14 14:00:00\"\n    eastern = pytz.timezone(\"US/Eastern\")\n    target_datetime = eastern.localize(datetime.strptime(target_datetime_str, \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"))\n\n    # Symbol for the market\n    symbol = \"BTCUSDT\"\n\n    # Get the candle data for the specified time\n    candle_data = get_candle_data(symbol, target_datetime)\n    if candle_data:\n        change_percentage = ((candle_data[\"close\"] - candle_data[\"open\"]) / candle_data[\"open\"]) * 100\n        if change_percentage >= 0:\n            print(\"recommendation: p2\")  # Up\n        else:\n            print(\"recommendation: p1\")  # Down\n    else:\n        print(\"recommendation: p3\")  # Unknown/50-50 due to data fetch failure\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nProxy failed with error: 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy/klines?symbol=BTCUSDT&interval=1h&limit=1&startTime=1749924000000&endTime=1749927600000, falling back to primary API.\nPrimary API also failed with error: 451 Client Error:  for url: https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines?symbol=BTCUSDT&interval=1h&limit=1&startTime=1749924000000&endTime=1749927600000\nrecommendation: p3\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.981 = 98.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749927645 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-14 19:00:45 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Consider using a different data retrieval strategy or verifying API access and functionality prior to execution to ensure data availability."

I need you to generate code to solve the following prediction market question:\n\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Bitcoin Up or Down - June 14, 2 PM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for BTC/USDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTC/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTC/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 551821\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease write Python code that will gather the necessary data to answer this question definitively.\n\nIMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:\n1. DO NOT use command-line arguments. Extract all necessary information from the question itself.\n2. Load environment variables from .env files using the python-dotenv package.\n3. For API keys, use the following environment variables:\n   - BINANCE_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_CBB_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_CFB_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_NBA_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_NFL_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\n\n4. Available Data Sources Information:\n   ALL AVAILABLE API CONFIGURATIONS:\n   - Binance (Category: crypto):\n     * API Key: BINANCE_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.binance.com/api/v3\n     * proxy endpoint: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\n   - Sports Data IO - MLB (Category: sports, Subcategory: baseball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb\n   - Sports Data IO - NBA (Category: sports, Subcategory: basketball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NBA_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nba\n   - Sports Data IO - NFL (Category: sports, Subcategory: football):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NFL_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nfl\n   - Sports Data IO - NHL (Category: sports, Subcategory: hockey):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nhl\n   - Sports Data IO - CFB (Category: sports, Subcategory: college football):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_CFB_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/cfb\n   - Sports Data IO - CBB (Category: sports, Subcategory: college basketball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_CBB_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/cbb\n\n5. Query Type Specific Information:\n\n   Cryptocurrency Data Sources:\n   - Binance:\n     * primary: https://api.binance.com/api/v3\n     * proxy: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\n     * RECOMMENDED: Use this proxy endpoint first for better reliability\n     * Example: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy?symbol=BTCUSDT&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime=TIMESTAMP&endTime=TIMESTAMP\n\n     * CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Since a proxy endpoint is provided, you MUST implement a fallback mechanism:\n       1. Try the proxy endpoint first (better reliability)\n       2. If proxy fails (timeout, error response, etc.), automatically fall back to the primary endpoint\n       3. Your code MUST handle this gracefully with try/except blocks\n\n     Example fallback code structure:\n     ```python\n     def get_data(symbol, start_time, end_time):\n         try:\n             # First try the proxy endpoint\n             response = requests.get(f\"{proxy_url}?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n         except Exception as e:\n             print(f\"Proxy endpoint failed: {str(e)}, falling back to primary endpoint\")\n             # Fall back to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n             response = requests.get(f\"{primary_url}/klines?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n     ```\n     \n6. NEVER include actual API key values in the code, always load them from environment variables.\n\n7. IMPORTANT FOR ALL DATA SOURCES: If a proxy endpoint is provided alongside a primary endpoint, you MUST implement the fallback mechanism described above. This is critical for reliability:\n   - Always try the proxy endpoint first\n   - If the proxy fails, fall back to the primary endpoint\n   - Use appropriate timeout values (10 seconds recommended)\n   - Include proper error handling with try/except blocks\n\nThe code should be completely self-contained and runnable with no arguments.\n\n\nHere's a complete code example that shows how to solve this type of problem:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Note: Binance public API doesn't require an API key for basic price queries\n# However, if we need rate limits increased or private endpoints, we would use these:\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\nBINANCE_API_SECRET = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\")\n\n# Sensitive data patterns to mask in logs\nSENSITIVE_PATTERNS = [\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_KEY\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    #

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTC/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTC/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 551821\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749927645 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-14 19:00:45 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p3. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Consider using a different data retrieval strategy or verifying API access and functionality prior to execution to ensure data availability.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport os\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# API keys loaded from environment variables\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\n\n# API endpoints\nPRIMARY_API_URL = \"https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines\"\nPROXY_API_URL = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\"\n\ndef fetch_data_from_binance(symbol, interval, start_time, end_time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches data from Binance API with a fallback to a proxy server if the primary request fails.\n    \"\"\"\n    params = {\n        \"symbol\": symbol,\n        \"interval\": interval,\n        \"limit\": 1,\n        \"startTime\": start_time,\n        \"endTime\": end_time\n    }\n    headers = {\n        \"X-MBX-APIKEY\": BINANCE_API_KEY\n    }\n\n    try:\n        # Try fetching data from the proxy endpoint first\n        response = requests.get(PROXY_API_URL, params=params, headers=headers, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n        if data:\n            return data\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Proxy endpoint failed: {str(e)}, falling back to primary endpoint\")\n        # Fall back to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n        try:\n            response = requests.get(PRIMARY_API_URL, params=params, headers=headers, timeout=10)\n            response.raise_for_status()\n            data = response.json()\n            if data:\n                return data\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"Primary endpoint also failed: {str(e)}\")\n            return None\n\ndef get_price_change(symbol, target_datetime):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the price change for a given symbol at a specific datetime.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert datetime to milliseconds since epoch\n    start_time = int(target_datetime.timestamp() * 1000)\n    end_time = start_time + 3600000  # 1 hour later\n\n    data = fetch_data_from_binance(symbol, \"1h\", start_time, end_time)\n    if data and len(data) > 0:\n        open_price = float(data[0][1])\n        close_price = float(data[0][4])\n        change_percent = ((close_price - open_price) / open_price) * 100\n        return change_percent\n    else:\n        return None\n\ndef main():\n    # Define the target datetime for the event\n    target_datetime = datetime(2025, 6, 14, 14, 0)  # June 14, 2025, 2 PM ET\n\n    # Symbol for the market\n    symbol = \"BTCUSDT\"\n\n    # Get the price change\n    price_change = get_price_change(symbol, target_datetime)\n\n    # Determine the resolution based on the price change\n    if price_change is None:\n        print(\"recommendation: p3\")  # Unknown or data not available\n    elif price_change >= 0:\n        print(\"recommendation: p2\")  # Up\n    else:\n        print(\"recommendation: p1\")  # Down\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p1\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.981 = 98.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the Bitcoin price (BTC/USDT) on Binance was up or down for the 1-hour candle starting at June 14, 2 PM ET. The resolution depends on the percentage change shown on Binance's 1H candle for that specific time.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the exact time window. June 14, 2 PM ET converts to UTC. ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, so 2 PM ET would be 18:00 UTC. The 1-hour candle from 18:00 to 19:00 UTC on June 14, 2025.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources provide price data around that time. For example, source [4] mentions the price on June 14, 2025, at 3:11 AM IST (which is 21:41 UTC on June 13), but that's not our target time. Source [64] gives a price of $105,085.82 at 2:52 PM IST (09:22 UTC), still not the right window.\n\nSource [19] from Mudrex's analysis on June 14, 2025, includes a detailed technical analysis. They mention Bitcoin's price dipping to around $104,000 but doesn't specify the exact 1H window. However, source [55] from coinalyze.net lists real-time data, including a 1H candle. The current timestamp in the problem is 2025-06-14 19:00:45 UTC, which is after the candle's end time (19:00 UTC). \n\nSource [7] (TradingView) shows the BTC/USDT price at 104,564.19 USDT with a -0.44% change in 24 hours, but that's the daily change. The 1H candle's percentage change is needed. Source [10] (CoinMarketCap) has a BTC/USDT rate history. On June 14, the rate is 104,834.05 USDT, down 1.15% from the previous day. However, this is the daily change, not the specific 1H window.\n\nWait, the key is to find the 1H candle's change at 18:00-19:00 UTC. Source [8] from Kaggle has 4-hour data up to January 2025, but not the exact hour. Source [52] from Kaggle includes 1-hour data up to June 29, 2022, which is too old. \n\nLooking at source [55] (coinalyze.net), the news mentions Bitcoin's price at specific times. For example, at 08:06 UTC on June 14, BTC is slightly up, but that's before our target window. The latest data in the search results might not cover the exact 1H window. However, the current timestamp in the problem is 2025-06-14 19:00:45 UTC, which is just after the candle closed. The user's personalization instructions say to use the provided URLs heavily. \n\nSource [64] (latestly.com) updated at 2:52 PM IST (09:22 UTC) mentions a price drop to $105,085.82. But the 1H candle from 18:00-19:00 UTC would be after that. Source [70] (TradingView) as of the current timestamp shows the price at 104,564.19 USDT, but again, this is the current price, not the specific 1H change.\n\nWait, the problem states that the resolution source is Binance's BTC/USDT pair, specifically the 1H candle's percentage change. The search results include Binance API data sources, like [1], [2], [8], [22], [34], [46], [59], which might have the required data. However, the provided search results don't include the exact 1H candle data for that specific hour. \n\nGiven that the current timestamp is after the event, and assuming the data is available, the answer should rely on the most recent data points. Source [4] and [64] mention prices around $105,000 on June 14, but without the exact 1H change. However, source [19] from Mudrex's analysis on June 14, 2025, indicates that Bitcoin's price was around $105,728.21 with a 0.41% decline. If the 1H candle during 18:00-19:00 UTC had a positive or negative change, but without explicit data, perhaps the closing price after the candle would indicate the change.\n\nAlternatively, source [10] (CoinMarketCap) shows the BTC/USDT rate on June 14 as 104,834.05, which is a -1.15% change from the previous day. But this is a 24h change, not the 1H. \n\nSince the exact 1H percentage isn't directly provided in the search results, but the problem's current time is after the candle's close, and the user instructions say to use the provided sources, I might have to infer based on the closest data. If the price at 19:00 UTC is lower than at 18:00, the change would be negative. \n\nLooking at source [64], the price dropped from $105,668.88 to $105,085.82 during the day. If the 1H window in question was part of a downward trend, the change might be negative. However, without explicit data, this is speculative. \n\nBut the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p1 as Down, p2 as Up. If the change is >=0, p2; else p1. \n\nGiven the search results show a slight decrease on June 14 (sources [4], [64], [7]), it's likely the 1H candle had a negative change. Therefore, the resolution would be p1 (Down).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.981 = 98.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the 1-hour BTC/USDT candle starting June 14, 2 PM ET. The outcome depends on whether the percentage change is >=0 (Up) or <0 (Down). The resolution source is Binance's BTC/USDT pair, specifically the 1H candle's change value.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the exact time of the candle. The title says June 14, 2 PM ET. ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, so 2 PM ET is 18:00 UTC. The 1-hour candle from 18:00 to 19:00 UTC on June 14, 2025.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources provide data. The current timestamp given is June 14, 2025, 19:00:45 UTC. The candle in question would have closed at 19:00 UTC, so the data should be available now.\n\nSearch result [1] from TradingView shows the current price as 104,564.19 USDT, with a 24h change of -0.44%. However, this is the 24h change, not the specific 1H candle. \n\nSearch result [2] mentions the RSI on June 14 at 16:00 UTC, but not the specific 1H candle. \n\nSearch result [4] and [12] from coinalyze.net have real-time data. The latest entry at 17:30 UTC on June 14 mentions Bitcoin's price movement but doesn't specify the 1H change. \n\nSearch result [18] from CoinMarketCap shows the BTC/USDT rate history. On June 14, the rate is 104,834.05 USDT with a -1.15% change. However, this is the 24h change, not the 1H.\n\nSearch result [49] from Binance Square has a post indicating the current price is $105,265.32 as of June 14, 2025, but again, this is a spot price, not the 1H change.\n\nThe key is to find the exact 1H candle's percentage change from 18:00 to 19:00 UTC. Since the current time is 19:00:45 UTC, the candle has just closed. The user provided a link to Binance's BTC/USDT page, which should display the 1H change. \n\nHowever, the search results don't explicitly state the 1H change for that specific candle. But given the current price movement and the data available, if the closing price at 19:00 UTC is higher than the opening at 18:00 UTC, the change is positive. \n\nLooking at search result [18], the price on June 14 is 104,834.05 USDT, and the previous close was 106,054.18 USDT. But this is daily data. \n\nWait, the user specified the 1H candle. The ancillary data says the change value displayed on Binance's graph for the 1H candle is the source. Without direct access to Binance's API, the search results don't have the exact 1H change. However, considering the current timestamp and the data available, if the price at 19:00 UTC is higher than at 18:00, it's Up. \n\nAssuming the price increased during that hour, but the 24h change is negative. However, the specific 1H candle's change is needed. Since the data isn't explicitly in the search results, but the user's personalization says to use the provided URLs, which include Binance's BTC/USDT page. \n\nSearch result [25] is Binance's BTC/USDT page, which would have the 1H candle data. The current price is 104,875.18 USDT. If the 1H candle's change is positive, it resolves to Up. However, without the exact percentage, I have to infer. \n\nGiven the current time is just after 19:00 UTC, and the 24h change is negative, but the 1H could be positive. However, without explicit data, perhaps the change is negative. But the user's instruction says to use the exact 1H candle data from Binance. Since the search results don't provide this, but the current price is slightly lower than the previous day's close, maybe the 1H candle was negative. \n\nWait, the current price in [1] is 104,564.19, and in [18], it's 104,834.05. The exact 1H change isn't clear. However, the user's personalization says to re-evaluate using the exact 1H candle data from Binance. Since the data isn't in the provided search results, but the current time is past the candle's close, the resolution should be based on the actual data. \n\nBut since I can't access real-time data, I have to rely on the provided context. The latest data in the search results as of 19:00 UTC on June 14 shows a slight decrease. Therefore, the 1H candle likely had a negative change, resolving to Down. But I'm not certain. However, the user's instruction says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Given the 24h trend is down, but the 1H could vary. \n\nAlternatively, if the 1H candle's close is higher than open, it's Up. Without explicit data, but considering the market's movement around that time, perhaps it's Down. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the user's instruction to use Binance's data and the current time is after the event, the resolution should be Down (p1). But I need to check again. \n\nWait, the query's resolution conditions are p1: Down, p2: Up. If the 1H change is >=0, it's Up (p2). If <0, Down (p1). The exact 1H change isn't in the search results, but the current price movement suggests a slight decrease. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.981 = 98.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.981 = 98.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

Your task is to analyze the provided query and decide which AI solver is best suited to handle it.\n\nAvailable solvers: perplexity\n\nSolver descriptions:\n- perplexity: Uses the Perplexity AI search engine to find information online to answer general questions. Best for:\n  * Historical data and events\n  * General knowledge questions requiring context\n  * Questions needing interpretation of complex information\n  * Has knowledge cutoff and may not have very recent information\n\n- code_runner: Executes code to fetch real-time data from specific APIs. Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Available Crypto Data Sources:\n    - Binance: Provides cryptocurrency price data for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies\n  * Available Sports Data Sources:\n    - Sports Data IO - MLB (baseball): MLB baseball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NBA (basketball): NBA basketball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NFL (football): NFL football scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NHL (hockey): NHL hockey scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - CFB (college football): College Football (NCAA) scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - CBB (college basketball): College Basketball (NCAA) scores, statistics, and game data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Bitcoin Up or Down - June 14, 2 PM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for BTC/USDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTC/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTC/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 551821\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\"), college football (e.g., \"What was the score of the Alabama game last Saturday?\"), college basketball (e.g., \"What was Duke's score in their last game?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",
