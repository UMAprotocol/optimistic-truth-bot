Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Bitcoin Up or Down - June 16, 10 PM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for BTC/USDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTC/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTC/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 552305\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.

Recommendation found: p3.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p3\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.9595, ID: 33412958444737445462410158381231650809080379668428168763423266510042212897840, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.0405, ID: 108980577095141681557937545161568812718730617159654674679910656130937096897594, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.960 = 96.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTC/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTC/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 552305\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date.

Recommendation found: p3.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p3\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.9595, ID: 33412958444737445462410158381231650809080379668428168763423266510042212897840, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.0405, ID: 108980577095141681557937545161568812718730617159654674679910656130937096897594, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.960 = 96.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on whether the BTC/USDT 1-hour candle starting June 16, 10 PM ET closed up or down. The resolution depends on Binance's data for that specific candle. \n\nFirst, I need to convert the event time from ET to UTC. The current timestamp given is June 17, 2025, 3:07:16 UTC. The event is on June 16, 10 PM ET. Checking the search results, EDT is UTC-4. So 10 PM EDT would be 2 AM UTC the next day (June 17). Wait, but the event date in the title is June 16. That might be a problem. Let me confirm the time conversion again. If it's June 16, 10 PM EDT, adding 4 hours would make it June 17, 2 AM UTC. But the current time is June 17, 3:07 UTC, which is after the candle's close. The 1-hour candle from 2 AM to 3 AM UTC would have closed at 3 AM, and now it's past that. So the data should be available.\n\nNext, I need to check Binance's data for that specific 1-hour candle. The search results include sources like TradingView and Binance's own pages. For example, result 6 mentions BTCUSDT futures with a price of 108,484.5 USDT on June 2025. Result 20 mentions a price drop on May 17, 2025, but that's not relevant here. Result 38 has historical data up to June 15, 2025, but not the 16th. Result 40 shows a BTC price of 107,162.80 USDT on TradingView, but the timestamp isn't clear. \n\nLooking at result 26, the BTCUSDT chart on TradingView as of June 17, 2025, shows the current price around 107,162.80 USDT. However, the specific 1-hour candle from 2 AM to 3 AM UTC on June 17 needs the percentage change. If the close was higher than the open, it's up (p2), else down (p1). \n\nSince the current time is past the candle's close, I should look for the finalized data. The user specified using Binance's change value for the 1H candle. If the change is >=0%, resolve to p2 (Up), else p1 (Down). \n\nBut the search results don't explicitly show the exact percentage change for that specific hour. However, result 40 (TradingView) as of June 17 shows a 0.50% increase in the past 24 hours, but that's not the 1-hour change. Without direct data from the search results indicating the exact percentage, I might have to infer based on available info. \n\nWait, result 20 mentions a price drop on May 17, 2025, but that's a different date. Result 38's historical data ends on June 15. The most recent data point in the search is from June 17, 3:07 UTC, but the specific candle in question (2-3 AM UTC) might have a positive or negative change. Since the user's current time is after the candle close, and assuming the data is available, but the provided search results don't have the exact figure, I might have to default to the most probable outcome based on ancillary data. \n\nHowever, the user instruction says if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. But since the event time was June 16, 10 PM ET (June 17, 2 AM UTC), and the current time is June 17, 3:07 AM UTC, the candle has closed. If the search results don't have the exact data, perhaps I should check if there's any mention of the price movement around that time. \n\nLooking at result 26 again, the current price is 107,162.80, with a 0.50% increase in 24h. But the 1-hour change isn't specified. If I can't find the exact change, and the user requires Binance's data, but it's not present in the search results, I might have to resolve as p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The ancillary data says p1 is Down, p2 is Up. If I can't verify, maybe default to p3 (50-50), but the user says if no info, assume the most probable outcome. Wait, the instructions say: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome... and the event date is in the past... assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nThe condition here is that the market resolves to Up if the change is >=0%. If there's no data, but the current price after the candle is higher than before, but without knowing the open and close of that specific hour, it's unclear. Since the search results don't provide the exact 1-hour candle data, and I can't compute it from the available info, I might have to conclude that there's insufficient data to verify, hence p4. But the user instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, without knowing the direction, the most probable can't be determined, so p4. But wait, the ancillary data defines p3 as 0.5, which is unknown/50-50. But the resolution conditions are p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: 0.5. The user's instruction says if no info, assume the most probable outcome. If the event is in the past and no data, but the market is about whether the change is >=0, and without data, perhaps it's safer to resolve as p4 (cannot be determined). However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But how to determine the most probable without data? Maybe the default is p3, but the instructions say p3 is 0.5, which is unknown. Alternatively, if the event has occurred but no data, perhaps it's p4. \n\nWait, the personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nIn this case, the event date is in the past (June 16, 10 PM ET, which is June 17, 2 AM UTC), and the current time is June 17, 3:07 AM UTC, so the candle has closed. If the search results don't have the specific data for that hour, but there's general price info, maybe infer. For example, if the price around that time was increasing, but without exact data, it's uncertain. Since the user specified Binance as the source, and the search results don't have the exact 1-hour change, I can't verify. Therefore, I should default to p4. However, the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome if no data. But without any data points, how to determine probable? It's a 50-50 chance, so p3. But the ancillary data defines p3 as 0.5, which is unknown. The resolution conditions are p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: 0.5. The user's personalization says if no info, assume the most probable outcome. If the market is about whether the change is >=0, and without data, it's impossible to know, so p4. But the instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, without any data, the most probable can't be determined, hence p4. \n\nWait, the personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nIn this case, the ancillary data's resolution conditions are p1: Down, p2: Up. If there's no data, but the event has occurred, and we can't infer, then default to p4. However, the user might expect that if the event time has passed, and the data is available on Binance, but not in the search results, perhaps I should check again. \n\nLooking at the search results, result 6 mentions BTCUSDT futures at 108,484.5 USDT on June 2025, but the date isn't specified. Result 20 is about May 17, 2025. Result 38's historical data ends on June 15. Result 40 (TradingView) as of June 17 shows a 0.50% increase in 24h, but that's not the 1h change. \n\nSince the exact 1-hour candle's percentage change isn't available in the provided search results, and the resolution source is Binance's data for that specific candle, which isn't present here, I can't verify the outcome. Therefore, according to the instructions, if no verifiable info, and the event date is in the past, default to p4. \n\nBut wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past... assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" The condition is that the market resolves based on the 1h candle's percentage change. Without data, the most probable outcome can't be determined, so p4. \n\nHowever, the current time is after the candle's close. If the user provided a URL in the prompt, I should use that. The user did include a URL: https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT. Checking the search results, result 18 and 23 are Binance's BTC/USDT spot page, but the content in the search results doesn't show the specific 1h candle data. The provided search results for Binance's page (results 18, 23) mention the current price but not historical candles. \n\nSince the search results don't include the specific 1h candle data needed, and I can't access live data, I have to rely on the provided context. Without the specific data point, I can't confirm the outcome. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.

The user wants to resolve a market based on whether the BTC/USDT 1-hour candle starting June 16, 10 PM ET closed up or down. The resolution depends on Binance's data for that specific candle. \n\nFirst, I need to convert the event time from ET to UTC. The current timestamp given is June 17, 2025, 3:07:16 UTC. The event is on June 16, 10 PM ET. Checking the search results, EDT is UTC-4. So 10 PM EDT would be 2 AM UTC the next day (June 17). Wait, but the event date in the title is June 16. That might be a problem. Let me confirm the time conversion again. If it's June 16, 10 PM EDT, adding 4 hours would make it June 17, 2 AM UTC. But the current time is June 17, 3:07 UTC, which is after the candle's close. The 1-hour candle from 2 AM to 3 AM UTC would have closed at 3 AM, and now it's past that. So the data should be available.\n\nNext, I need to check Binance's data for that specific 1-hour candle. The search results include sources like TradingView and Binance's own pages. For example, result 6 mentions BTCUSDT futures with a price of 108,484.5 USDT on June 2025. Result 20 mentions a price drop on May 17, 2025, but that's not relevant here. Result 38 has historical data up to June 15, 2025, but not the 16th. Result 40 shows a BTC price of 107,162.80 USDT on TradingView, but the timestamp isn't clear. \n\nLooking at result 26, the BTCUSDT chart on TradingView as of June 17, 2025, shows the current price around 107,162.80 USDT. However, the specific 1-hour candle from 2 AM to 3 AM UTC on June 17 needs the percentage change. If the close was higher than the open, it's up (p2), else down (p1). \n\nSince the current time is past the candle's close, I should look for the finalized data. The user specified using Binance's change value for the 1H candle. If the change is >=0%, resolve to p2 (Up), else p1 (Down). \n\nBut the search results don't explicitly show the exact percentage change for that specific hour. However, result 40 (TradingView) as of June 17 shows a 0.50% increase in the past 24 hours, but that's not the 1-hour change. Without direct data from the search results indicating the exact percentage, I might have to infer based on available info. \n\nWait, result 20 mentions a price drop on May 17, 2025, but that's a different date. Result 38's historical data ends on June 15. The most recent data point in the search is from June 17, 3:07 UTC, but the specific candle in question (2-3 AM UTC) might have a positive or negative change. Since the user's current time is after the candle close, and assuming the data is available, but the provided search results don't have the exact figure, I might have to default to the most probable outcome based on ancillary data. \n\nHowever, the user instruction says if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. But since the event time was June 16, 10 PM ET (June 17, 2 AM UTC), and the current time is June 17, 3:07 AM UTC, the candle has closed. If the search results don't have the exact data, perhaps I should check if there's any mention of the price movement around that time. \n\nLooking at result 26 again, the current price is 107,162.80, with a 0.50% increase in 24h. But the 1-hour change isn't specified. If I can't find the exact change, and the user requires Binance's data, but it's not present in the search results, I might have to resolve as p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The ancillary data says p1 is Down, p2 is Up. If I can't verify, maybe default to p3 (50-50), but the user says if no info, assume the most probable outcome. Wait, the instructions say: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome... and the event date is in the past... assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nThe condition here is that the market resolves to Up if the change is >=0%. If there's no data, but the current price after the candle is higher than before, but without knowing the open and close of that specific hour, it's unclear. Since the search results don't provide the exact 1-hour candle data, and I can't compute it from the available info, I might have to conclude that there's insufficient data to verify, hence p4. But the user instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, without knowing the direction, the most probable can't be determined, so p4. But wait, the ancillary data defines p3 as 0.5, which is unknown/50-50. But the resolution conditions are p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: 0.5. The user's instruction says if no info, assume the most probable outcome. If the event is in the past and no data, but the market is about whether the change is >=0, and without data, perhaps it's safer to resolve as p4 (cannot be determined). However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But how to determine the most probable without data? Maybe the default is p3, but the instructions say p3 is 0.5, which is unknown. Alternatively, if the event has occurred but no data, perhaps it's p4. \n\nWait, the personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nIn this case, the event date is in the past (June 16, 10 PM ET, which is June 17, 2 AM UTC), and the current time is June 17, 3:07 AM UTC, so the candle has closed. If the search results don't have the specific data for that hour, but there's general price info, maybe infer. For example, if the price around that time was increasing, but without exact data, it's uncertain. Since the user specified Binance as the source, and the search results don't have the exact 1-hour change, I can't verify. Therefore, I should default to p4. However, the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome if no data. But without any data points, how to determine probable? It's a 50-50 chance, so p3. But the ancillary data defines p3 as 0.5, which is unknown. The resolution conditions are p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: 0.5. The user's personalization says if no info, assume the most probable outcome. If the market is about whether the change is >=0, and without data, it's impossible to know, so p4. But the instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, without any data, the most probable can't be determined, hence p4. \n\nWait, the personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nIn this case, the ancillary data's resolution conditions are p1: Down, p2: Up. If there's no data, but the event has occurred, and we can't infer, then default to p4. However, the user might expect that if the event time has passed, and the data is available on Binance, but not in the search results, perhaps I should check again. \n\nLooking at the search results, result 6 mentions BTCUSDT futures at 108,484.5 USDT on June 2025, but the date isn't specified. Result 20 is about May 17, 2025. Result 38's historical data ends on June 15. Result 40 (TradingView) as of June 17 shows a 0.50% increase in 24h, but that's not the 1h change. \n\nSince the exact 1-hour candle's percentage change isn't available in the provided search results, and the resolution source is Binance's data for that specific candle, which isn't present here, I can't verify the outcome. Therefore, according to the instructions, if no verifiable info, and the event date is in the past, default to p4. \n\nBut wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past... assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" The condition is that the market resolves based on the 1h candle's percentage change. Without data, the most probable outcome can't be determined, so p4. \n\nHowever, the current time is after the candle's close. If the user provided a URL in the prompt, I should use that. The user did include a URL: https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT. Checking the search results, result 18 and 23 are Binance's BTC/USDT spot page, but the content in the search results doesn't show the specific 1h candle data. The provided search results for Binance's page (results 18, 23) mention the current price but not historical candles. \n\nSince the search results don't include the specific 1h candle data needed, and I can't access live data, I have to rely on the provided context. Without the specific data point, I can't confirm the outcome. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.9595, ID: 33412958444737445462410158381231650809080379668428168763423266510042212897840, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.0405, ID: 108980577095141681557937545161568812718730617159654674679910656130937096897594, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.960 = 96.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market that depends on whether the BTC/USDT 1-hour candle starting June 16 at 10 PM ET closed up or down. The resolution source is Binance's data for that specific candle.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the exact time window. The candle starts at June 16, 10 PM ET. Since Binance uses UTC, I should convert 10 PM ET to UTC. ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, so 10 PM ET would be 2 AM UTC the next day, which is June 17 at 2 AM UTC. The 1-hour candle runs from 2:00 AM to 3:00 AM UTC on June 17.\n\nNext, I need to check the price data for that specific hour. Looking at the search results, there are a few sources. The Binance historical data (result 6) might have the 1-hour candles. Also, result 5 from CoinMarketCap shows the BTC/USDT rate history. On June 16, the closing price was $106,746.81 USDT at 00:00 UTC. But that's the daily close, not the hourly. \n\nResult 4 mentions a price of $106,800 as of 10:00 AM UTC on June 17, but that's outside our window. Result 2 and 3 from Coin Edition and Cryptorank mention the price on June 17 around $106,678, but those are daily predictions, not the specific hour. \n\nResult 25 from Binance Futures shows the BTCUSDT perpetual contract price at 107,519.8, but that's the mark price, not the spot. The key is to find the exact 1-hour candle close at 3:00 AM UTC on June 17. \n\nLooking at result 48, the StatMuse data shows hourly prices for June 14, but not the 17th. Result 5's table ends on June 16 with a closing price of $106,746.81, but that's the daily close. The user needs the hourly change for the specific hour. \n\nSince the provided search results don't explicitly state the 1-hour candle change for June 17 2-3 AM UTC, I might have to infer from nearby data. However, the current timestamp is June 17, 3:07 AM UTC. The candle in question ended at 3:00 AM UTC, just 7 minutes prior. Binance might not have finalized the data yet, leading to potential delays. \n\nGiven that the data isn't available in the provided sources and considering the current time is shortly after the candle close, it's possible the information isn't updated yet. Without explicit data confirming the percentage change, the market can't be resolved definitively. Therefore, the recommendation would be p4 (cannot resolve now) or p3 (50-50). However, the user's previous attempt returned p4, so they want a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, checking result 47, a prediction market forecasts Bitcoin reaching $108,765.10 by 2:00 AM, but that's a different time. Result 24 mentions BTC at $106,800 at 10:00 AM UTC, which is later. \n\nSince the exact data isn't present, and considering the time proximity, the resolution should be p4. But the user says to try again. Maybe the 1-hour candle's change can be inferred from the price movement around that time. If the price increased from the open to close of that hour, it's up. \n\nLooking at result 25, the Binance Futures price is up 2.13% with a 24h high of 108,900. However, this is futures, not spot. The spot price from result 1 is $107,222.88 as of page load time, which is around the current time. If the 1-hour candle closed at 3:00 AM UTC, and the price increased during that hour, then it's up. But without explicit data, it's uncertain. \n\nGiven the lack of concrete data in the provided context, the safest recommendation is p4. However, if forced to choose based on nearby data, assuming a slight increase, it might be p2 (Up). But without clear evidence, p4 is more accurate.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe market resolution depends on the 1-hour BTC/USDT candle starting June 16, 10 PM ET (June 17, 2:00 AM UTC). The current timestamp is **2025-06-17 03:07:16 UTC**, which is **7 minutes after the candle closed** (3:00 AM UTC).  \n\n- Binance data finalization for hourly candles typically occurs shortly after the candle closes, but the provided search results do not explicitly confirm the finalized percentage change for this specific candle.  \n- While some sources indicate bullish momentum (e.g., BTC testing $108K-$109K resistance [4][24]), none provide direct evidence of the **exact 1-hour candle\u2019s percentage change** required for resolution.  \n- Without verifiable data from Binance\u2019s API or a confirmed timestamped source, the outcome cannot be definitively determined at this time.  \n\n**Note:** If the candle closed with a \u22650% change, the resolution would be p2 (Up). If <0%, p1 (Down). However, given the lack of explicit data in the provided context, p4 is the safest recommendation.",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750129636 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-17 03:07:16 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query.

But that's the daily close, not the hourly. \n\nResult 4 mentions a price of $106,800 as of 10:00 AM UTC on June 17, but that's outside our window. Result 2 and 3 from Coin Edition and Cryptorank mention the price on June 17 around $106,678, but those are daily predictions, not the specific hour. \n\nResult 25 from Binance Futures shows the BTCUSDT perpetual contract price at 107,519.8, but that's the mark price, not the spot. The key is to find the exact 1-hour candle close at 3:00 AM UTC on June 17. \n\nLooking at result 48, the StatMuse data shows hourly prices for June 14, but not the 17th. Result 5's table ends on June 16 with a closing price of $106,746.81, but that's the daily close. The user needs the hourly change for the specific hour. \n\nSince the provided search results don't explicitly state the 1-hour candle change for June 17 2-3 AM UTC, I might have to infer from nearby data. However, the current timestamp is June 17, 3:07 AM UTC. The candle in question ended at 3:00 AM UTC, just 7 minutes prior. Binance might not have finalized the data yet, leading to potential delays. \n\nGiven that the data isn't available in the provided sources and considering the current time is shortly after the candle close, it's possible the information isn't updated yet. Without explicit data confirming the percentage change, the market can't be resolved definitively. Therefore, the recommendation would be p4 (cannot resolve now) or p3 (50-50). However, the user's previous attempt returned p4, so they want a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, checking result 47, a prediction market forecasts Bitcoin reaching $108,765.10 by 2:00 AM, but that's a different time. Result 24 mentions BTC at $106,800 at 10:00 AM UTC, which is later. \n\nSince the exact data isn't present, and considering the time proximity, the resolution should be p4. But the user says to try again. Maybe the 1-hour candle's change can be inferred from the price movement around that time. If the price increased from the open to close of that hour, it's up. \n\nLooking at result 25, the Binance Futures price is up 2.13% with a 24h high of 108,900. However, this is futures, not spot. The spot price from result 1 is $107,222.88 as of page load time, which is around the current time. If the 1-hour candle closed at 3:00 AM UTC, and the price increased during that hour, then it's up. But without explicit data, it's uncertain. \n\nGiven the lack of concrete data in the provided context, the safest recommendation is p4. However, if forced to choose based on nearby data, assuming a slight increase, it might be p2 (Up). But without clear evidence, p4 is more accurate.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe market resolution depends on the 1-hour BTC/USDT candle starting June 16, 10 PM ET (June 17, 2:00 AM UTC). The current timestamp is **2025-06-17 03:07:16 UTC**, which is **7 minutes after the candle closed** (3:00 AM UTC).  \n\n- Binance data finalization for hourly candles typically occurs shortly after the candle closes, but the provided search results do not explicitly confirm the finalized percentage change for this specific candle.  \n- While some sources indicate bullish momentum (e.g., BTC testing $108K-$109K resistance [4][24]), none provide direct evidence of the **exact 1-hour candle\u2019s percentage change** required for resolution.  \n- Without verifiable data from Binance\u2019s API or a confirmed timestamped source, the outcome cannot be definitively determined at this time.  \n\n**Note:** If the candle closed with a \u22650% change, the resolution would be p2 (Up). If <0%, p1 (Down). However, given the lack of explicit data in the provided context, p4 is the safest recommendation.\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.9595, ID: 33412958444737445462410158381231650809080379668428168763423266510042212897840, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.0405, ID: 108980577095141681557937545161568812718730617159654674679910656130937096897594, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.960 = 96.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.

If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750129636 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-17 03:07:16 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Ensure the data fetching process is robust against errors and retries are attempted. Include error handling that provides more detailed feedback on what went wrong during data retrieval."

The logic within the code is sound for determining whether the price went up or down based on the fetched data. However, the code resulted in a recommendation of 'p3' (unknown/50-50) due to an inability to fetch or parse the data correctly. This outcome suggests a failure in either the API call or data handling, which is critical for resolving the query accurately. Furthermore, the market data strongly favors an 'Up' outcome with a confidence of 96.0%, which directly contradicts the solver's recommendation of 'p3'. This discrepancy indicates a significant misalignment with market sentiment, necessitating a default to 'p4'.",

However, the recommendation of p4 (cannot resolve now) is conservative given the proximity of the event's conclusion and the lack of finalized data from Binance.

However, the market sentiment strongly favors an 'Up' outcome (p2), with a confidence level of 96.0%, which contradicts the solver's recommendation of p4.
