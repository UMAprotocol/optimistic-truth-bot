      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the M80 vs TYLOO match in the BLAST.tv Austin Major Stage 2. The event date is June 7, 2025, which is the same as the current date provided (June 7, 2025, 18:46:59 UTC). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already happened. Since the current timestamp is June 7, 2025, and the match is scheduled for 2:45 PM ET, which is 18:45 UTC, the match time would be 18:45 UTC. The current time is 18:46:59 UTC, so the match should have just started or maybe even concluded. However, the search results don't provide the actual outcome yet. \n\nLooking at the search results, most sources like HLTV, Dust2.us, and others list the match as upcoming or provide pre-match analysis. For example, source [1] mentions the match is part of the opening round of Stage 2, and source [8] gives the lineup but no result. There's no mention of the match being postponed or canceled. \n\nSince the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, but there's no verifiable outcome available in the provided sources, I need to follow the user's instruction: if no outcome is available and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that p2 corresponds to M80 winning. However, the search results indicate TYLOO has better recent performance. For instance, source [9] notes TYLOO's recent wins and higher ranking. Also, source [67] from freetips.com predicts TYLOO might have an edge. But according to the user's resolution conditions, p1 is TYLOO and p2 is M80. Wait, the resolution_conditions say p1:0, p2:1, p3:0.5, with p1 as TYLOO and p2 as M80. But the market resolves to \"M80\" if they win, which is p2. However, the user might have a typo here. Let me double-check.\n\nThe user's resolution_conditions state: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to TYLOO, p2 to M80, p3 to unknown. So if TYLOO wins, it's p1 (0), M80 is p2 (1). Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, the market resolves to \"M80\" if M80 wins, which would be p2:1. But the way it's written, p1 is TYLOO, p2 is M80. So if TYLOO wins, the resolution is p1 (0), which is confusing. Maybe it's a mistake in the ancillary data. But the user says \"This market will resolve to 'M80' if M80 win... to 'TYLOO' if TYLOO win...\" So the correct mapping should be p1 for TYLOO and p2 for M80. But the res_data has p1:0, p2:1. That might be a misalignment. However, the user's instruction says to follow the ancillary data strictly. \n\nBut regardless, the main issue is determining the match outcome. Since the sources don't report the result yet, and the event is on the current day but the time has passed, but no result is available, the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The conditions in the query's ancillary data might have a typo, but assuming the resolution is based on who won. \n\nLooking at the sources, TYLOO has a better recent form, higher ranking (25 vs M80's 26), and won their last encounter in ESL Pro League. However, in the previous match between them (source [9]), M80 won 2-1. But recent form for TYLOO includes wins over Complexity and FlyQuest in Stage 1, while M80 hasn't played recently. \n\nGiven the absence of the actual result in the provided context and the instruction to assume the most probable outcome, and considering TYLOO's recent performance, the resolution would lean towards TYLOO (p1). However, the user's ancillary data maps p1 to 0, which might be a mistake. Wait, the resolution_conditions say p1:0, p2:1, p3:0.5. That seems like the values might be the payout ratios, but the user's description says p1 corresponds to TYLOO, p2 to M80. So if TYLOO wins, the market resolves to p1 (0), which doesn't make sense. This might be an error in the ancillary data setup. However, the user's main query is to resolve based on the actual outcome. \n\nSince the actual result isn't available in the provided search results, and the event date is today but past the scheduled time, but no sources report a postponement or cancellation, the safe resolution would be p3 (unknown/50-50) if the match hasn't concluded yet. However, the current timestamp is 18:46 UTC, and the match was at 18:45 UTC. It's possible the match just started, so it's still ongoing. But without live data, we can't know. \n\nBut according to the user's personalization instructions: if the event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time, it's still future. Here, the match was at 18:45 UTC, and the current time is 18:46:59 UTC, so it's just past. However, without result data, and given the user's instruction to default to p4 if the event is in the future, but the event is in the past, but no info, we have to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nBut the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" \n\nThe ancillary data's resolution conditions are a bit confusing, but the market resolves to M80 if they win (p2:1), TYLOO if they win (p1:0). But the res_data seems to have p1:0, p2:1, which might be a mislabeling. However, the key is to determine the winner based on available info. \n\nSince the search results don't show the outcome, but TYLOO is favored in recent form and rankings, the probable outcome is TYLOO. Therefore, the resolution would be p1. But according to the user's ancillary data, p1 corresponds to TYLOO, so recommendation: p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the M80 vs TYLOO match in the BLAST.tv Austin Major Stage 2. The event date is June 7, 2025, which is the same as the current date provided (June 7, 2025, 18:46:59 UTC). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already happened. Since the current timestamp is June 7, 2025, and the match is scheduled for 2:45 PM ET, which is 18:45 UTC, the match time would be 18:45 UTC. The current time is 18:46:59 UTC, so the match should have just started or maybe even concluded. However, the search results don't provide the actual outcome yet. \n\nLooking at the search results, most sources like HLTV, Dust2.us, and others list the match as upcoming or provide pre-match analysis. For example, source [1] mentions the match is part of the opening round of Stage 2, and source [8] gives the lineup but no result. There's no mention of the match being postponed or canceled. \n\nSince the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, but there's no verifiable outcome available in the provided sources, I need to follow the user's instruction: if no outcome is available and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that p2 corresponds to M80 winning. However, the search results indicate TYLOO has better recent performance. For instance, source [9] notes TYLOO's recent wins and higher ranking. Also, source [67] from freetips.com predicts TYLOO might have an edge. But according to the user's resolution conditions, p1 is TYLOO and p2 is M80. Wait, the resolution_conditions say p1:0, p2:1, p3:0.5, with p1 as TYLOO and p2 as M80. But the market resolves to \"M80\" if they win, which is p2. However, the user might have a typo here. Let me double-check.\n\nThe user's resolution_conditions state: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to TYLOO, p2 to M80, p3 to unknown. So if TYLOO wins, it's p1 (0), M80 is p2 (1). Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, the market resolves to \"M80\" if M80 wins, which would be p2:1. But the way it's written, p1 is TYLOO, p2 is M80. So if TYLOO wins, the resolution is p1 (0), which is confusing. Maybe it's a mistake in the ancillary data. But the user says \"This market will resolve to 'M80' if M80 win... to 'TYLOO' if TYLOO win...\" So the correct mapping should be p1 for TYLOO and p2 for M80. But the res_data has p1:0, p2:1. That might be a misalignment. However, the user's instruction says to follow the ancillary data strictly. \n\nBut regardless, the main issue is determining the match outcome. Since the sources don't report the result yet, and the event is on the current day but the time has passed, but no result is available, the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The conditions in the query's ancillary data might have a typo, but assuming the resolution is based on who won. \n\nLooking at the sources, TYLOO has a better recent form, higher ranking (25 vs M80's 26), and won their last encounter in ESL Pro League. However, in the previous match between them (source [9]), M80 won 2-1. But recent form for TYLOO includes wins over Complexity and FlyQuest in Stage 1, while M80 hasn't played recently. \n\nGiven the absence of the actual result in the provided context and the instruction to assume the most probable outcome, and considering TYLOO's recent performance, the resolution would lean towards TYLOO (p1). However, the user's ancillary data maps p1 to 0, which might be a mistake. Wait, the resolution_conditions say p1:0, p2:1, p3:0.5. That seems like the values might be the payout ratios, but the user's description says p1 corresponds to TYLOO, p2 to M80. So if TYLOO wins, the market resolves to p1 (0), which doesn't make sense. This might be an error in the ancillary data setup. However, the user's main query is to resolve based on the actual outcome. \n\nSince the actual result isn't available in the provided search results, and the event date is today but past the scheduled time, but no sources report a postponement or cancellation, the safe resolution would be p3 (unknown/50-50) if the match hasn't concluded yet. However, the current timestamp is 18:46 UTC, and the match was at 18:45 UTC. It's possible the match just started, so it's still ongoing. But without live data, we can't know. \n\nBut according to the user's personalization instructions: if the event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time, it's still future. Here, the match was at 18:45 UTC, and the current time is 18:46:59 UTC, so it's just past. However, without result data, and given the user's instruction to default to p4 if the event is in the future, but the event is in the past, but no info, we have to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nBut the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" \n\nThe ancillary data's resolution conditions are a bit confusing, but the market resolves to M80 if they win (p2:1), TYLOO if they win (p1:0). But the res_data seems to have p1:0, p2:1, which might be a mislabeling. However, the key is to determine the winner based on available info. \n\nSince the search results don't show the outcome, but TYLOO is favored in recent form and rankings, the probable outcome is TYLOO. Therefore, the resolution would be p1. But according to the user's ancillary data, p1 corresponds to TYLOO, so recommendation: p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: M80, Price: 0.0245, ID: 83386042114420918590746119785727187097942044646055466523645593135805219969135, Winner: No\n- Token: TYLOO, Price: 0.9755, ID: 51609852982990183138210951897146541702607488033808500254798038822292418583409, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to TYLOO, p2 to M80, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = TYLOO, p2 = M80\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors TYLOO outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.976 = 97.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Therefore, the recommendation remains p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: M80, Price: 0.0245, ID: 83386042114420918590746119785727187097942044646055466523645593135805219969135, Winner: No\n- Token: TYLOO, Price: 0.9755, ID: 51609852982990183138210951897146541702607488033808500254798038822292418583409, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to TYLOO, p2 to M80, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = TYLOO, p2 = M80\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors TYLOO outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.976 = 97.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
