      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Jerome Powell will say the word \"Energy\" during his FOMC press conference on June 18, 2025. The resolution depends on whether the term is used in his introductory statement or the Q&A session. Any usage, including plural or possessive forms, counts, but other forms or compound words don't. The sources provided include transcripts and press releases from the Fed, YouTube videos, and other related documents.\n\nFirst, I need to check the specific transcript from June 18, 2025. The search result [9] is the transcript of Powell's opening statement on that day. Let me go through it. The opening statement mentions various economic factors like GDP, inflation, labor market, and tariffs. Skimming through, I don't see the word \"Energy\" here. The focus is on trade policies, inflation, and employment.\n\nNext, looking at the FOMC statement issued the same day [10], the content discusses economic activity, unemployment, inflation, and monetary policy. Again, no mention of \"Energy\" in the key points.\n\nThe press conference transcript [9] includes the Q&A session. Let me check if \"Energy\" comes up in any questions or answers. The provided excerpts from the transcript don't show any instances of the word. The questions from Steve Liesman and others revolve around tariffs, unemployment risks, and policy stance. Powell's responses focus on trade implications, inflation, and economic outlook without bringing up energy-related topics.\n\nAdditionally, other sources like the Schwab market update [12] mention the press conference but don't indicate any discussion on energy. The Treasury Secretary's transcript [8] talks about the economy's resilience but doesn't link to energy in the context of the Fed's statements.\n\nSince the resolution depends on the exact usage of the word \"Energy\" and none of the provided sources from the June 18 event include that term, the answer should resolve to \"No\". Even though there are mentions of other economic factors, the specific keyword isn't present in the transcripts or statements from that day. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750273053 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-18 18:57:33 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Jerome Powell will say the word \"Energy\" during his FOMC press conference on June 18, 2025. The resolution depends on whether the term is used in his introductory statement or the Q&A session. Any usage, including plural or possessive forms, counts, but other forms or compound words don't. The sources provided include transcripts and press releases from the Fed, YouTube videos, and other related documents.\n\nFirst, I need to check the specific transcript from June 18, 2025. The search result [9] is the transcript of Powell's opening statement on that day. Let me go through it. The opening statement mentions various economic factors like GDP, inflation, labor market, and tariffs. Skimming through, I don't see the word \"Energy\" here. The focus is on trade policies, inflation, and employment.\n\nNext, looking at the FOMC statement issued the same day [10], the content discusses economic activity, unemployment, inflation, and monetary policy. Again, no mention of \"Energy\" in the key points.\n\nThe press conference transcript [9] includes the Q&A session. Let me check if \"Energy\" comes up in any questions or answers. The provided excerpts from the transcript don't show any instances of the word. The questions from Steve Liesman and others revolve around tariffs, unemployment risks, and policy stance. Powell's responses focus on trade implications, inflation, and economic outlook without bringing up energy-related topics.\n\nAdditionally, other sources like the Schwab market update [12] mention the press conference but don't indicate any discussion on energy. The Treasury Secretary's transcript [8] talks about the economy's resilience but doesn't link to energy in the context of the Fed's statements.\n\nSince the resolution depends on the exact usage of the word \"Energy\" and none of the provided sources from the June 18 event include that term, the answer should resolve to \"No\". Even though there are mentions of other economic factors, the specific keyword isn't present in the transcripts or statements from that day. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.935, ID: 103561943543752497361868157559705989164524419521558078749291227713013226083876, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.065, ID: 34363847412258103537178531274138225598847917251501722440922006682897176974381, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.935 = 93.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he does, \"No\" otherwise. They provided a bunch of search results, mostly transcripts from previous Fed meetings and related news articles.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mention of \"Energy\" in the context of the June 18, 2025 press conference. The user's additional instruction mentions rechecking sources for any overlooked mentions of \"Energy\" or factors influencing a \"Yes\" outcome.\n\nLooking through the search results, most of the Fed transcripts (like [1], [13], [23], [55]) are from June 18, 2025. Let's check those. In the opening statement of the June 18 transcript (search result [13], page 4), there's a mention: \"excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.6 percent.\" Here, \"energy\" is used in the context of inflation metrics, specifically excluding food and energy from core PCE. \n\nAdditionally, in the same transcript (search result [13], page 5), Powell states, \"Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in...\" but the transcript cuts off. However, another part of the same transcript (search result [55], page 5) continues: \"service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals.\" Wait, that doesn't include \"energy.\"\n\nWait, let me double-check. The key mention is in the opening statement where he discusses core PCE excluding energy. That's a direct use of the word \"energy.\" The user's condition is that any usage, regardless of context, counts. Pluralization or possessive forms count, but other forms don't. Here, \"energy\" is used in its base form, so it should count.\n\nOther search results, like [48] from thenationalnews.com, mention \"geopolitical headwinds driving a surge in energy prices,\" but that's a news article, not the official transcript. The resolution source is the official transcripts and video, so external articles don't count. Similarly, [11] and [65] also mention energy prices in news context, but again, not in the Fed's official statements.\n\nLooking at the June 18, 2025 FOMC statement (search result [25]), the official release doesn't mention \"energy.\" However, the press conference transcript (search result [13], [23], [55]) does include the word in the context of core inflation. Since the market resolution is based on the press conference's transcripts and video, that mention in the opening statement qualifies.\n\nTherefore, Powell did say \"Energy\" during the press conference. The answer should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\n**Analysis:**  \nThe search results include multiple transcripts from Chair Powell's June 18, 2025, press conference. In the **opening statement** (source [13][23][55]), Powell explicitly references \"energy\" when discussing inflation metrics:  \n*\"excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.6 percent\"*[13].  \n\nThis satisfies the resolution criteria:  \n1. The term \"energy\" was spoken during the designated event.  \n2. The usage occurred in the official transcript/video of the press conference.  \n3. No contextual exceptions apply (all forms/contexts count per the market rules).  \n\nNo contradictory evidence exists in the provided sources. External news articles (e.g., [11][48][65]) reference energy prices but are irrelevant to the resolution, which depends solely on Powell\u2019s spoken words.  \n\n**Conclusion:** The market resolves to **\"Yes\" (p2)**.",

They provided a bunch of search results, mostly transcripts from previous Fed meetings and related news articles.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mention of \"Energy\" in the context of the June 18, 2025 press conference. The user's additional instruction mentions rechecking sources for any overlooked mentions of \"Energy\" or factors influencing a \"Yes\" outcome.\n\nLooking through the search results, most of the Fed transcripts (like [1], [13], [23], [55]) are from June 18, 2025. Let's check those. In the opening statement of the June 18 transcript (search result [13], page 4), there's a mention: \"excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.6 percent.\" Here, \"energy\" is used in the context of inflation metrics, specifically excluding food and energy from core PCE. \n\nAdditionally, in the same transcript (search result [13], page 5), Powell states, \"Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in...\" but the transcript cuts off. However, another part of the same transcript (search result [55], page 5) continues: \"service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals.\" Wait, that doesn't include \"energy.\"\n\nWait, let me double-check. The key mention is in the opening statement where he discusses core PCE excluding energy. That's a direct use of the word \"energy.\" The user's condition is that any usage, regardless of context, counts. Pluralization or possessive forms count, but other forms don't. Here, \"energy\" is used in its base form, so it should count.\n\nOther search results, like [48] from thenationalnews.com, mention \"geopolitical headwinds driving a surge in energy prices,\" but that's a news article, not the official transcript. The resolution source is the official transcripts and video, so external articles don't count. Similarly, [11] and [65] also mention energy prices in news context, but again, not in the Fed's official statements.\n\nLooking at the June 18, 2025 FOMC statement (search result [25]), the official release doesn't mention \"energy.\" However, the press conference transcript (search result [13], [23], [55]) does include the word in the context of core inflation. Since the market resolution is based on the press conference's transcripts and video, that mention in the opening statement qualifies.\n\nTherefore, Powell did say \"Energy\" during the press conference. The answer should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\n**Analysis:**  \nThe search results include multiple transcripts from Chair Powell's June 18, 2025, press conference. In the **opening statement** (source [13][23][55]), Powell explicitly references \"energy\" when discussing inflation metrics:  \n*\"excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.6 percent\"*[13].  \n\nThis satisfies the resolution criteria:  \n1. The term \"energy\" was spoken during the designated event.  \n2. The usage occurred in the official transcript/video of the press conference.  \n3. No contextual exceptions apply (all forms/contexts count per the market rules).  \n\nNo contradictory evidence exists in the provided sources. External news articles (e.g., [11][48][65]) reference energy prices but are irrelevant to the resolution, which depends solely on Powell\u2019s spoken words.  \n\n**Conclusion:** The market resolves to **\"Yes\" (p2)**.\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.935, ID: 103561943543752497361868157559705989164524419521558078749291227713013226083876, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.065, ID: 34363847412258103537178531274138225598847917251501722440922006682897176974381, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.935 = 93.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
