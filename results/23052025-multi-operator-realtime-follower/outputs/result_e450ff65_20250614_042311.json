      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether Israel initiated a military action against Iraq between June 11 and June 13, 2025, based on the defined market resolution criteria. The ancillary data specifies that \"Yes\" (p2) is if Israel took military action on Iraqi soil, airspace, or maritime territory, or against Iraqi embassies/consulates. The user provided several search results, and I need to analyze them to determine the answer.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the search results to find any mentions of Israeli military actions involving Iraq during that timeframe. The key here is to check if Israel used force in Iraqi territory as per the market's definition. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources (7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16) mention Iraq filing a UN complaint against Israel for violating its airspace during the strikes on Iran. For example, result 7 states that Iraq accused Israel of using Iraqi airspace to conduct military strikes in Iran. Similarly, result 15 mentions that Israeli aircraft transited through Iraqi airspace en route to Iran. \n\nThe market's resolution conditions consider airspace violation as a military action if it's part of an attack. However, there's an update to the market: intercepting drones/missiles over Iraqi territory doesn't count. The Israeli strikes on Iran involved using Iraqi airspace to reach targets in Iran, which is a military action as per the definition. The Iraqi government's complaints confirm this, stating that Israel's use of their airspace was a violation. \n\nBut wait, the military action in question is against Iraq itself. The market specifies actions \"against Iraq,\" so if Israel was passing through Iraqi airspace to attack Iran, does that count? The market's description says military action on Iraqi soil, airspace, etc., so even if the target is Iran, using Iraqi airspace for the attack would still be a violation. The update clarifies that intercepting third-party drones/missiles over Iraq doesn't count, but here Israel is the one launching the attack through Iraqi airspace. \n\nTherefore, based on the search results, Israel did use Iraqi airspace as part of their military operation against Iran. This constitutes a military action on Iraqi airspace, meeting the \"Yes\" condition. The sources are credible, with multiple reports from different outlets and Iraq's official complaints to the UN. Thus, the market should resolve to p2 (Yes).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The user is asking whether Israel initiated a military action against Iraq between June 11 and June 13, 2025, based on the defined market resolution criteria. The ancillary data specifies that \"Yes\" (p2) is if Israel took military action on Iraqi soil, airspace, or maritime territory, or against Iraqi embassies/consulates. The user provided several search results, and I need to analyze them to determine the answer.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the search results to find any mentions of Israeli military actions involving Iraq during that timeframe. The key here is to check if Israel used force in Iraqi territory as per the market's definition. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources (7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16) mention Iraq filing a UN complaint against Israel for violating its airspace during the strikes on Iran. For example, result 7 states that Iraq accused Israel of using Iraqi airspace to conduct military strikes in Iran. Similarly, result 15 mentions that Israeli aircraft transited through Iraqi airspace en route to Iran. \n\nThe market's resolution conditions consider airspace violation as a military action if it's part of an attack. However, there's an update to the market: intercepting drones/missiles over Iraqi territory doesn't count. The Israeli strikes on Iran involved using Iraqi airspace to reach targets in Iran, which is a military action as per the definition. The Iraqi government's complaints confirm this, stating that Israel's use of their airspace was a violation. \n\nBut wait, the military action in question is against Iraq itself. The market specifies actions \"against Iraq,\" so if Israel was passing through Iraqi airspace to attack Iran, does that count? The market's description says military action on Iraqi soil, airspace, etc., so even if the target is Iran, using Iraqi airspace for the attack would still be a violation. The update clarifies that intercepting third-party drones/missiles over Iraq doesn't count, but here Israel is the one launching the attack through Iraqi airspace. \n\nTherefore, based on the search results, Israel did use Iraqi airspace as part of their military operation against Iran. This constitutes a military action on Iraqi airspace, meeting the \"Yes\" condition. The sources are credible, with multiple reports from different outlets and Iraq's official complaints to the UN. Thus, the market should resolve to p2 (Yes).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.0295, ID: 12803410034085656249393889057793493953015869632023114499735860186556348968741, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.9705, ID: 11262683098933029510443984378265710685633107850453807153106850013012480072228, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

The user wants to know if Israel initiated a military action against Iraq between June 11 and June 13, 2025, based on the ancillary data provided. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. The market resolves to Yes if Israel took military action on Iraqi soil, airspace, or maritime territory, or against Iraqi embassies/consulates, as acknowledged by Israel or credible reports. Cyber attacks, sanctions, or diplomatic actions don't count.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mentions of Israeli military actions in Iraq during that timeframe. Let's go through the sources.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention Israel's strikes on Iran. For example, sources [1], [2], [5], and [16] detail Israel's Operation Rising Lion targeting Iranian nuclear and military sites. However, the user's query is about military actions against Iraq, not Iran. So I need to see if any of these actions involved Iraq.\n\nSource [4] is a YouTube video transcript where Iraq's Foreign Minister accuses Israel of violating Iraqi airspace. The transcript mentions that Iraqi Foreign Minister stated Israeli jets violated Iraqi skies. Source [9] from Times of Israel says Iraq filed a UN complaint over Israel's violation of Iraqi airspace during the attack on Iran. Similarly, source [14] from Tribune.com.pk reports Iraq filing a UN complaint about Israeli airspace violation. Source [15] from newarab.com also mentions Iraq submitting a complaint to the UN Security Council over the airspace breach. Source [12] from shafaq.com notes that over 150 Iranian drones crossed Iraqi airspace toward Israel, but that's Iran's action, not Israel's. Source [13] from Newsx mentions Iranian officials claiming Israeli jets used Iraqi airspace to attack Iran. Source [18] from shafaq.com reports Israeli missiles crashing in Iraq after being intercepted by Iran, but it's unclear if these were intentional strikes on Iraq or remnants from targeting Iran.\n\nThe key points here are the Iraqi government's accusations that Israel used Iraqi airspace to launch strikes on Iran. The ancillary data specifies that military action includes use of force in Iraqi airspace. However, there's an update to the market: intercepting drones/missiles from a third country over Iraq doesn't count. So if Israel's jets entered Iraqi airspace to attack Iran, does that count as a military action against Iraq?\n\nThe resolution conditions state that any use of force executed by Israel on Iraqi soil, airspace, or maritime territory counts. So even if Israel's target was Iran, violating Iraqi airspace with military jets or missiles would qualify. The Iraqi government has filed complaints, indicating they consider it a violation. Additionally, source [18] mentions Israeli missiles crashing in Iraq, which could be part of the strikes on Iran but landed in Iraq. However, the update says intercepting third-country drones/missiles over Iraq doesn't count. But in this case, Israel's own missiles entering Iraqi airspace during an attack on Iran might still count, depending on intent.\n\nThe critical factor is whether Israel's military actions directly involved Iraqi territory. The use of Iraqi airspace by Israeli jets to attack Iran would be a military action in Iraqi airspace. The Iraqi government's complaints and the UN filings support this. Additionally, if missiles or debris landed in Iraq, that could be considered use of force on Iraqi soil, even if unintended. However, the update specifies that intercepting third-country projectiles doesn't count. But here, Israel's own missiles entering Iraq during an attack on Iran might still count as military action against Iraq, as per the ancillary data's definition.\n\nTherefore, based on the sources, Israel's military actions involved violating Iraqi airspace, which meets the criteria for the market resolving to Yes (p2). The Iraqi government's official complaints and the UN filings are credible reports acknowledging this violation. Even though the primary target was Iran, the use of Iraqi airspace constitutes a military action against Iraq as defined.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The user wants to know if Israel initiated a military action against Iraq between June 11 and June 13, 2025, based on the ancillary data provided. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if Israel took such action, \"No\" (p1) if not, and p3 if uncertain.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mentions of Israeli military actions in Iraq during that timeframe. The search results provided are extensive, so I'll focus on the ones that mention Israel and Iraq together.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources (like [8], [12], [16], [34], [36], [38], [61]) mention Iraq submitting a complaint to the UN about Israel violating its airspace during strikes on Iran. For example, result [8] states that Iraq condemned Israel's use of Iraqi airspace for military attacks. Similarly, [12] and [38] detail Iraq's official complaints to the UN Security Council regarding Israeli airspace violations.\n\nHowever, the key point here is whether Israel's actions constitute a military action against Iraq itself. The ancillary data specifies that the action must be against Iraqi soil, airspace, maritime territory, or embassies. The user's update clarifies that intercepting drones/missiles over Iraqi territory doesn't count. \n\nThe search results indicate that Israel used Iraqi airspace to attack Iran (e.g., [36] mentions airlines diverting flights due to airspace closures over Iraq after Israeli strikes on Iran). But using Iraqi airspace for transit to attack another country (Iran) isn't the same as a military action against Iraq. The military action here is against Iran, not Iraq. \n\nAdditionally, result [61] mentions three missiles found in Iraq, one unexploded in Diyala. However, there's no confirmation these were Israeli missiles targeting Iraq. The context suggests these might be related to the Iran-Israel conflict, possibly debris or stray missiles, but not intentional strikes on Iraqi targets.\n\nThe ancillary data requires the action to be officially acknowledged by Israel or credible reports. The search results don't show Israel acknowledging strikes on Iraqi targets. Instead, they show Iraq complaining about airspace violations, which, per the update, don't qualify if it's interception over Iraqi territory. \n\nTherefore, based on the evidence, Israel's military actions were directed at Iran, using Iraqi airspace as a pathway, but not targeting Iraq itself. No credible reports confirm Israeli strikes on Iraqi soil, maritime areas, or embassies. Thus, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). However, the user mentioned previous responses returned p2, so I need to double-check.\n\nWait, the user's personalization says the previous response was p2, and they want a different approach. Let me re-examine. The key is whether using Iraqi airspace for strikes on Iran counts. The ancillary data says military action on Iraqi airspace counts. If Israel's jets entered Iraqi airspace to launch attacks on Iran, that's a use of force in Iraqi airspace, which would qualify. The update says intercepting third-country drones doesn't count, but this is Israel actively using Iraqi airspace for their own strikes. \n\nSo, even if the target is Iran, the action occurs in Iraqi airspace, which meets the criteria. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2). But wait, the update says intercepting over Iraq doesn't count. However, Israel's use of airspace for their own strikes is different. The military action is Israel's attack via Iraqi airspace, which is a use of force in Iraqi airspace, thus qualifying. \n\nTherefore, despite the initial thought, according to the market's definition, using Iraqi airspace for military strikes (even against another country) would count. Hence, the answer should be p2. But I need to confirm if the sources explicitly state Israel conducted strikes through Iraqi airspace. \n\nLooking at [36], it says airlines diverted due to Israeli strikes on Iran, implying use of Iraqi airspace. [12] and [38] state Iraq accused Israel of violating airspace for military attacks. If Israel's military action involved traversing Iraqi airspace to strike Iran, that's a use of force in Iraqi airspace, meeting the criteria. Therefore, the resolution should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\n**Analysis:**  \nThe market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if Israel conducted military actions in Iraqi airspace, soil, or maritime territory between June 11\u201313, 2025. According to multiple sources, Iraq filed formal complaints with the UN Security Council on June 13, 2025, accusing Israel of violating its airspace to conduct strikes against Iran[8][12][16][34][38]. While the primary target was Iran, Israel\u2019s use of Iraqi airspace for military operations (e.g., launching missiles/drones) constitutes a \"military action\" under the market\u2019s definition, as it involves the **use of force in Iraqi airspace**. The Iraqi government explicitly condemned these actions as violations of sovereignty[12][38], and the U.S. Embassy in Iraq partially evacuated personnel due to regional tensions[10][11].  \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that actions in Iraqi airspace count, even if the target is a third country. Interceptions over Iraq (e.g., of Iranian drones) would not qualify, but Israel\u2019s proactive use of Iraqi airspace for strikes meets the \"military action\" criteria. No evidence suggests cyber attacks or diplomatic measures alone triggered the complaint. Thus, the resolution is **p2 (Yes)**.",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749874420 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-14 04:13:40 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p2.

The ancillary data defines military action as any use of force on Iraqi soil, airspace, or maritime territory that's officially acknowledged or reported by credible sources. Even if Israel's target was Iran, entering Iraqi airspace for military operations without consent would count. \n\nAdditionally, the updates clarify that intercepting drones/missiles over Iraq doesn't qualify. However, the Israeli strikes were offensive actions, not interceptions. The Iraqi government's complaints to the UN and statements about airspace violation indicate that Israel's use of their airspace was part of a military operation against Iran, which fits the definition provided. \n\nSince the time frame is up to June 13, 2025, and the strikes occurred on June 13, this falls within the market's resolution period. The credible reporting from multiple sources confirms the violation, so the market should resolve to Yes (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether Israel initiated a military action against Iraq between June 11 and June 13, 2025, based on the defined criteria. The resolution conditions are p2 for Yes, p1 for No, and p3 for uncertain. The user also provided some updates clarifying that intercepting drones or missiles over Iraq doesn't count.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mentions of Israeli military actions in Iraq during that timeframe. The search results [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17] mainly discuss Israeli strikes on Iran and the subsequent Iranian retaliation. However, some results mention Iraq in the context of the conflict.\n\nLooking at result [5], it mentions that Iraq's airspace was closed due to Israeli airstrikes on Iran. Result [11] states that Iraq closed its airspace because missiles and drones might transit through it. Result [16] reports over 150 Iranian drones passing through Iraqi airspace towards Israel, and result [17] mentions Israeli missiles crashing in Iraq after being intercepted by Iran. \n\nThe key point here is whether Israel's actions in Iraqi airspace count as military action. The user's update specifies that intercepting drones/missiles over Iraq doesn't qualify. However, if Israel actively targeted something within Iraq, that would count. The missiles crashing in Iraq (result [17]) were intercepted by Iran, so that's part of Iran's retaliation, not an Israeli attack on Iraq. The drones passing through Iraqi airspace (result [16]) are Iranian, so Israel intercepting them over Iraq might not count per the update.\n\nThere's no mention in the search results of Israel conducting airstrikes or ground operations within Iraq during the specified dates. The main Israeli operations were against Iran. The closure of Iraqi airspace was a precaution, not a result of direct Israeli military action on Iraq. Therefore, based on the provided information, Israel did not initiate a military action against Iraq as defined. The answer should be p2 if there was an action, but according to the data, it's p1 (No). Wait, the user's previous response was p2, but they want a different approach. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, result [17] says two Israeli missiles crashed in Iraq after being intercepted. Does that count as a military action? The market defines military action as use of force by Israel on Iraqi soil, airspace, or maritime territory. If the missiles were launched by Israel and landed in Iraq, even if intercepted, that could be considered a military action. However, the update says intercepting third-party drones/missiles over Iraq doesn't count. But these are Israeli missiles. If Israel fired missiles that entered Iraqi airspace and crashed there, that's a use of force in Iraqi airspace. But the context is that these were part of the strikes on Iran, possibly passing through Iraqi airspace. However, the market requires the action to be against Iraq itself. If the missiles were aimed at Iran but passed through Iraq, does that count? The resolution conditions specify actions on Iraqi soil, airspace, or maritime territory. So even if the target was Iran, if the missiles traversed Iraqi airspace, that's a use of force in Iraqi airspace. But the update says intercepting third-party missiles doesn't count, but these are Israeli missiles. So if Israel's missiles entered Iraqi airspace as part of their operation, that would be a military action against Iraq. However, the search results don't explicitly state that Israel targeted Iraq. The missiles crashing in Iraq were intercepted by Iran, implying they were part of the Iran-Israel exchange. The market requires the action to be against Iraq, but if Israel's missiles entered Iraqi airspace en route to Iran, does that count? The description says any use of force executed by Israel on Iraqi soil, airspace, or maritime territory. So even if the target was Iran, traversing Iraqi airspace with missiles could be considered a military action in Iraqi airspace. However, the update clarifies that intercepting third-country drones/missiles over Iraq doesn't count. But in this case, it's Israel's own missiles. This is a gray area. The market resolution depends on whether transit through airspace counts as a military action. The description says \"use of force executed by Israel on Iraqi... airspace\". If the missiles were passing through, is that considered a use of force? It might depend on the interpretation. However, the search results don't explicitly mention Israel targeting Iraq or conducting operations within Iraq. The missiles crashing there were part of the Iran-Israel conflict, not an attack on Iraq. Therefore, based on the available information, there's no clear evidence that Israel initiated a military action against Iraq as defined. Hence, the recommendation should be p1 (No). But the user's previous response was p2, so maybe I missed something. Let me check again. Result [17] says Israeli missiles crashed in Iraq after being intercepted. If those missiles were aimed at Iran but passed through Iraq, that's a use of force in Iraqi airspace. The market's resolution condition includes any use of force in Iraqi airspace. Even if the target was Iran, the passage through Iraqi airspace with missiles could count. However, the update says intercepting third-party drones/missiles doesn't count, but this is Israel's own missiles. This is a tricky point. The market's description says \"use of force executed by Israel on Iraqi... airspace\". If Israel's missiles entered Iraqi airspace as part of an attack, that's a military action in Iraqi airspace. Therefore, even if the target was Iran, the use of Iraqi airspace for the attack could qualify. However, the search results don't explicitly state that Israel's missiles entered Iraqi airspace. Result [17] mentions missiles crashing in Iraq after being intercepted by Iran, which suggests that the missiles were over Iraq, possibly en route to Iran. If that's the case, then Israel's military action involved using Iraqi airspace, which would qualify. Therefore, the answer would be p2 (Yes). But the user's previous response was p2, and they want a different approach. Maybe the initial assessment was correct, but the user wants to confirm. Given the ambiguity, if the missiles passed through Iraqi airspace, that's a military action in Iraqi airspace, hence p2. However, the update says intercepting third-party drones/missiles doesn't count, but this is Israel's own missiles. Therefore, the answer is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The answer should be p2 if there was an action, but according to the data, it's p1 (No). Wait, the user's previous response was p2, but they want a different approach. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, result [17] says two Israeli missiles crashed in Iraq after being intercepted. Does that count as a military action? The market defines military action as use of force by Israel on Iraqi soil, airspace, or maritime territory. If the missiles were launched by Israel and landed in Iraq, even if intercepted, that could be considered a military action. However, the update says intercepting third-party drones/missiles over Iraq doesn't count. But these are Israeli missiles. If Israel fired missiles that entered Iraqi airspace and crashed there, that's a use of force in Iraqi airspace. But the context is that these were part of the strikes on Iran, possibly passing through Iraqi airspace. However, the market requires the action to be against Iraq itself. If the missiles were aimed at Iran but passed through Iraq, does that count? The resolution conditions specify actions on Iraqi soil, airspace, or maritime territory. So even if the target was Iran, if the missiles traversed Iraqi airspace, that's a use of force in Iraqi airspace. But the update says intercepting third-party missiles doesn't count, but these are Israeli missiles. So if Israel's missiles entered Iraqi airspace as part of their operation, that would be a military action against Iraq. However, the search results don't explicitly state that Israel targeted Iraq. The missiles crashing in Iraq were intercepted by Iran, implying they were part of the Iran-Israel exchange. The market requires the action to be against Iraq, but if Israel's missiles entered Iraqi airspace en route to Iran, does that count? The description says any use of force executed by Israel on Iraqi soil, airspace, or maritime territory. So even if the target was Iran, traversing Iraqi airspace with missiles could be considered a military action in Iraqi airspace. However, the update clarifies that intercepting third-country drones/missiles over Iraq doesn't count. But in this case, it's Israel's own missiles. This is a gray area. The market resolution depends on whether transit through airspace counts as a military action. The description says \"use of force executed by Israel on Iraqi... airspace\". If the missiles were passing through, is that considered a use of force? It might depend on the interpretation. However, the search results don't explicitly mention Israel targeting Iraq or conducting operations within Iraq. The missiles crashing there were part of the Iran-Israel conflict, not an attack on Iraq. Therefore, based on the available information, there's no clear evidence that Israel initiated a military action against Iraq as defined. Hence, the recommendation should be p1 (No). But the user's previous response was p2, so maybe I missed something. Let me check again. Result [17] says Israeli missiles crashed in Iraq after being intercepted. If those missiles were aimed at Iran but passed through Iraq, that's a use of force in Iraqi airspace. The market's resolution condition includes any use of force in Iraqi airspace. Even if the target was Iran, the passage through Iraqi airspace with missiles could count. However, the update says intercepting third-party drones/missiles doesn't count, but this is Israel's own missiles. This is a tricky point. The market's description says \"use of force executed by Israel on Iraqi... airspace\". If Israel's missiles entered Iraqi airspace as part of an attack, that's a military action in Iraqi airspace. Therefore, even if the target was Iran, the use of Iraqi airspace for the attack could qualify. However, the search results don't explicitly state that Israel's missiles entered Iraqi airspace. Result [17] mentions missiles crashing in Iraq after being intercepted by Iran, which suggests that the missiles were over Iraq, possibly en route to Iran. If that's the case, then Israel's military action involved using Iraqi airspace, which would qualify. Therefore, the answer would be p2 (Yes). But the user's previous response was p2, and they want a different approach. Maybe the initial assessment was correct, but the user wants to confirm. Given the ambiguity, if the missiles passed through Iraqi airspace, that's a military action in Iraqi airspace, hence p2. However, the update says intercepting third-party drones/missiles doesn't count, but this is Israel's own missiles. Therefore, the answer is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.0295, ID: 12803410034085656249393889057793493953015869632023114499735860186556348968741, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.9705, ID: 11262683098933029510443984378265710685633107850453807153106850013012480072228, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (0.971 = 97.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether Israel initiated any military action against Iraq between June 11 and June 13, 2025, based on the defined criteria. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. The user also provided several search results, which I need to analyze carefully.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what constitutes a military action according to the market's definition. It includes airstrikes, naval attacks, or ground invasions on Iraqi soil, airspace, or maritime territory, or against Iraqi embassies/consulates. Cyber attacks, sanctions, or diplomatic actions don't count. Also, the action must be officially acknowledged by Israel or confirmed by credible reports.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are multiple sources mentioning that Iraq accused Israel of violating its airspace during strikes on Iran. For example, search results [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], and [18] all discuss Iraq filing a UN complaint over Israeli airspace violations. Specifically, Iraq claims that Israel used its airspace to launch attacks on Iran. The Iraqi government submitted formal complaints to the UN Security Council, stating that this was a breach of sovereignty.\n\nHowever, the key point here is whether Israel's use of Iraqi airspace for attacking Iran counts as a military action against Iraq. The market's description specifies that military action against Iraq includes actions on Iraqi soil, airspace, or maritime territory. Even if the target was Iran, using Iraqi airspace for such strikes would technically fall under the definition provided. But there's an update to consider: intercepting drones/missiles from a third country over Iraqi territory doesn't qualify. However, in this case, Israel wasn't intercepting; they were launching strikes on Iran through Iraqi airspace. \n\nThe search results don't mention any Israeli military actions directly targeting Iraqi soil, embassies, or consulates. The focus is on the airspace violation during the Iran strikes. The question is whether using airspace for transit to attack another country counts as a military action against Iraq. According to the market's rules, any use of force in Iraqi airspace (like launching missiles) would qualify. However, the update clarifies that interception over Iraq doesn't count, but this isn't interception\u2014it's an offensive action. \n\nBut wait, the market's resolution conditions require the action to be against Iraq. If Israel's military action was targeting Iran but passed through Iraqi airspace, does that count as an action against Iraq? The market description says \"military action on Iraqi soil, airspace, or maritime territory\" regardless of the target. So even if the target was Iran, using Iraqi airspace for the attack would still count. However, the update might be relevant here. The update states that intercepting drones/missiles from a third country over Iraq doesn't qualify. But this is different; Israel was attacking Iran, not intercepting. So the update might not apply here.\n\nAdditionally, the search results mention that three missiles were found in Iraq, possibly from the Israeli strikes. For example, result [13] states that three missiles were found in Diyala and Dhi Qar provinces. If these were part of the Israeli attack, that would constitute a military action on Iraqi soil. However, it's unclear if these missiles were launched by Israel or were part of Iran's retaliation. The context suggests they might be from Israel's strikes on Iran, but without explicit confirmation, this is uncertain.\n\nThe Israeli government hasn't officially acknowledged attacking Iraq, but credible reports (like the Iraqi government's complaints and multiple news sources) indicate that Israel used Iraqi airspace. The market requires either official acknowledgment or credible reporting. The numerous sources from reputable outlets like Times of Israel, The New Arab, and others reporting Iraq's complaints would count as credible reporting.\n\nTherefore, based on the definition, Israel's use of Iraqi airspace for military strikes against Iran constitutes a military action on Iraqi airspace, meeting the \"Yes\" condition. The update about interception doesn't apply here, so the resolution should be p2 (Yes). However, the user mentioned that the previous response was p2 and to re-evaluate considering market sentiment favoring 'No'. But according to the evidence, the correct resolution is p2. The market sentiment might be influenced by the target being Iran, but the criteria are clear about actions in Iraqi airspace. Thus, despite the sentiment, the facts point to p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The focus is on the airspace violation during the Iran strikes. The question is whether using airspace for transit to attack another country counts as a military action against Iraq. According to the market's rules, any use of force in Iraqi airspace (like launching missiles) would qualify. However, the update clarifies that interception over Iraq doesn't count, but this isn't interception\u2014it's an offensive action. \n\nBut wait, the market's resolution conditions require the action to be against Iraq. If Israel's military action was targeting Iran but passed through Iraqi airspace, does that count as an action against Iraq? The market description says \"military action on Iraqi soil, airspace, or maritime territory\" regardless of the target. So even if the target was Iran, using Iraqi airspace for the attack would still count. However, the update might be relevant here. The update states that intercepting drones/missiles from a third country over Iraq doesn't qualify. But this is different; Israel was attacking Iran, not intercepting. So the update might not apply here.\n\nAdditionally, the search results mention that three missiles were found in Iraq, possibly from the Israeli strikes. For example, result [13] states that three missiles were found in Diyala and Dhi Qar provinces. If these were part of the Israeli attack, that would constitute a military action on Iraqi soil. However, it's unclear if these missiles were launched by Israel or were part of Iran's retaliation. The context suggests they might be from Israel's strikes on Iran, but without explicit confirmation, this is uncertain.\n\nThe Israeli government hasn't officially acknowledged attacking Iraq, but credible reports (like the Iraqi government's complaints and multiple news sources) indicate that Israel used Iraqi airspace. The market requires either official acknowledgment or credible reporting. The numerous sources from reputable outlets like Times of Israel, The New Arab, and others reporting Iraq's complaints would count as credible reporting.\n\nTherefore, based on the definition, Israel's use of Iraqi airspace for military strikes against Iran constitutes a military action on Iraqi airspace, meeting the \"Yes\" condition. The update about interception doesn't apply here, so the resolution should be p2 (Yes). However, the user mentioned that the previous response was p2 and to re-evaluate considering market sentiment favoring 'No'. But according to the evidence, the correct resolution is p2. The market sentiment might be influenced by the target being Iran, but the criteria are clear about actions in Iraqi airspace. Thus, despite the sentiment, the facts point to p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.0295, ID: 12803410034085656249393889057793493953015869632023114499735860186556348968741, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.9705, ID: 11262683098933029510443984378265710685633107850453807153106850013012480072228, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (0.971 = 97.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749874420 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-14 04:13:40 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please re-evaluate the response considering the strong market sentiment favoring 'No' and ensure alignment with market data."

It correctly identifies the use of Iraqi airspace by Israel for strikes on Iran as a potential qualifying event under the market's definition of military action. However, the response fails to align with the strong market sentiment which heavily favors 'No' (97.05% confidence). This discrepancy between the solver's recommendation and market sentiment is critical and cannot be overlooked.",
