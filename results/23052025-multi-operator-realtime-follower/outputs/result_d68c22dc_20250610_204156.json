The search results include multiple sources, like news articles and transcripts. Let's go through them.\n\nLooking at the search results, several mention Trump's speech at Fort Bragg. For example, result [1] is a live stream of his remarks, and [6] and [14] also mention his speech. However, the key is whether he used \"LA\" or \"Los Angeles\" during that specific event.\n\nResult [11] quotes Trump's Truth Social post where he mentions Los Angeles, but that's before the event. Result [15] and [41] discuss his defense of deploying troops to LA, but again, these might be from other statements. \n\nResult [56] mentions Trump's speech at Fort Bragg, but the transcript isn't provided. However, result [45] includes a transcript snippet where Trump talks about Los Angeles during his departure speech. Wait, but the query specifies the main speech at the Fort Bragg event. The user mentioned that only the main speech and any Q&A during the event count. \n\nIn result [45], Trump is departing for Fort Bragg and answers questions. He mentions Los Angeles multiple times, like \"If I didn't 'SEND IN THE TROOPS' to Los Angeles...\" and refers to the situation there. However, this is during a press interaction before the main event. The user's query states that speeches outside the event don't count. \n\nLooking at result [56], which is a Sky News video, the description says Trump delivered a speech at Fort Bragg. Without the full transcript, I need to rely on other sources. Result [13] and [39] describe Trump watching a military demonstration and giving remarks, but don't quote the speech content. \n\nResult [64] mentions Trump's speech at Fort Bragg and his comments on immigration raids, but again, it's unclear if \"LA\" or \"Los Angeles\" were used. The key is whether during the main speech at Fort Bragg, he used those terms. \n\nThe user provided a link to the event details, but the search results don't include the actual transcript of the main speech. However, result [45] is a transcript where Trump mentions Los Angeles, but that's during a departure speech, not the main Fort Bragg event. \n\nWait, result [45] is a transcript of Trump departing for Fort Bragg. He answers questions about LA, but the main event speech is separate. The query specifies that only the main speech and any Q&A during the event count. If the Q&A was part of the event, then mentions there would count. \n\nIn result [45], the transcript is from when Trump was departing, but he mentions Los Angeles multiple times. However, if this Q&A happened at the Fort Bragg event, then it would count. The user's query says \"If the event contains a Q&A, it will count toward the resolution.\" So if the Q&A was part of the Fort Bragg event, then any mentions there would count. \n\nBut the transcript in [45] is titled \"President Trump Departs JBA En Route To Fort Bragg In...\" which suggests it's before the event. Therefore, those comments might not be part of the main event speech. \n\nLooking at result [59], which is a CBS News article, it states that Trump is expected to speak at Fort Bragg around 4 p.m. The article mentions his Truth Social post about a \"big speech\" but doesn't quote the speech. \n\nResult [62] is a Sky News video of Trump's speech at Fort Bragg, but without a transcript, it's hard to confirm. However, the search results don't provide direct evidence of Trump saying \"LA\" or \"Los Angeles\" during the main speech. \n\nGiven the available information, there's no direct evidence from the main speech transcript. However, in the departure remarks (result [45]), he did mention Los Angeles, but that's a separate event. Since the query specifies only the main speech and any Q&A during the Fort Bragg event count, and the departure remarks are not part of that, the answer would be \"No\". \n\nBut wait, result [45] might be part of the event. The user's query says the main speech and any Q&A during the event. If the Q&A was part of the Fort Bragg event, then mentions there would count. However, the transcript in [45] is from his departure en route to Fort Bragg, which is before the event. Therefore, those comments wouldn't count. \n\nWithout explicit evidence from the main speech, the resolution should be \"No\". However, some sources mention Trump discussing LA in the context of the event. For example, result [13] says Trump warned protesters at the military parade would face force, but that's a different event. \n\nAfter reviewing all sources, there's no clear mention of Trump using \"LA\" or \"Los Angeles\" during the Fort Bragg speech itself. Therefore, the recommendation is p1 (No). However, if the Q&A during the event included such mentions, but the provided search results don't confirm that, the safe answer is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Otherwise, the market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nAny usage of the term regardless of context will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nPluralization/possessive of the term will count toward the resolution of this market, however other forms will NOT count.\n\nInstances where the term is used in a compound word comprised of two full words in common usage will count regardless of context (e.g. joyful is not a compound word for \"joy,\" however \"killjoy\" is a compounding of the words \"kill\" and \"joy\").\n\nIf this event is definitively cancelled, or otherwise is not aired by June 10, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThis market is explicitly about the main speech Trump gives at the named event. Speeches, events, or comments that occur outside of this event will not qualify toward this market's resolution. If the event contains a Q&A, it will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nThe resolution source will be video of the events. market_id: 551078\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749588002 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-10 20:40:02 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query.

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors YES outcome (0.735 = 73.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.
