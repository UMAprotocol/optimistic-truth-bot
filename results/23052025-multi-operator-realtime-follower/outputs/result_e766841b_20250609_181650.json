However, item-specific exemptions or general tariff removals don't count. Also, judicial actions not initiated by the administration don't qualify unless the administration complies with a court order by ceasing enforcement.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any relevant actions taken by Trump regarding Mexican tariffs up to the current date of June 9, 2025. The search results include several sources about tariffs imposed and subsequent pauses. \n\nLooking at source [5], Trump imposed 25% tariffs on Mexico starting February 4, 2025. Then, source [6] mentions that on February 3, Trump suspended tariffs on Mexico and Canada for a month, but China's tariffs went into effect. However, this suspension was only for a month, so it would have ended around March 4. \n\nSource [9] and [10] from March 6, 2025, state that Trump extended the tariff pause on USMCA-compliant goods until April 2. This was a specific action targeting Mexico and Canada, so this would count as a delay. Then, source [11] mentions that on April 2, the USMCA exemption was extended indefinitely. This means that after April 2, tariffs on USMCA-compliant goods were paused indefinitely. \n\nAdditionally, source [16] from March 13, 2025, notes that the White House announced an indefinite suspension of tariffs on certain USMCA-compliant goods from Canada and Mexico. This suspension was effective from March 7, 2025, and the executive order didn't specify an end date. \n\nThe user's query deadline is May 31, 2025. Since the indefinite suspension was already in place by March and extended beyond April 2, this action by the Trump administration (executive order) to pause tariffs on USMCA-compliant Mexican imports would qualify as a pause or delay. Even though the initial pause was until April 2, the indefinite extension means the pause was still active as of May 31. \n\nFurthermore, the updates mention that judicial actions not initiated by Trump don't count unless the administration complies. However, in this case, the pauses were executive actions, so they qualify. The item-specific exemptions (like the 25 HTSUS codes) don't apply here because the pause was for all USMCA-compliant goods, not specific items. \n\nTherefore, based on the executive actions taken by Trump to pause tariffs on Mexico through the USMCA exemptions and the indefinite suspension, the answer should be Yes (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The user wants to know if Trump will lower tariffs on Mexico by May 31, 2025. The resolution conditions are p2 for Yes, p1 for No, and p3 for uncertain.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Yes\" if Trump takes any executive action or signs legislation that lowers, pauses, delays, or removes tariffs specifically targeting Mexico by that date. \n\nFirst, I need to review the search results to see if there are any actions taken by Trump regarding Mexican tariffs up to the current date, which is June 9, 2025. The user's current timestamp is 2025-06-09 18:12:01 UTC, so May 31 has already passed. \n\nLooking at the search results, there are several key events. On February 1, 2025, Trump imposed 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, which took effect on February 4 [8][14]. However, these were initially suspended for 30 days after negotiations, pushing the effective date to March 4 [11][16]. \n\nOn March 6, Trump delayed tariffs on USMCA-compliant goods from Mexico and Canada until April 2 [2][4][5][15][16]. This delay was later extended indefinitely on April 2, meaning USMCA-compliant goods would not face the 25% tariff [3][12][16]. Additionally, on April 11, Trump threatened new tariffs over water rights but didn't implement them immediately [1][16]. \n\nThe critical point here is the March 6 delay and the April 2 indefinite extension. The March 6 action specifically paused tariffs on USMCA-compliant Mexican imports, which qualifies as a \"pause\" or \"delay\" under the resolution conditions. The April 2 extension further continued this exemption. Since these actions were executive decisions by the Trump administration, they meet the criteria outlined in the ancillary data. \n\nHowever, I need to check if these actions were specifically targeting Mexico. The USMCA exemptions applied to both Canada and Mexico, but the resolution conditions state that only actions targeting Mexico count. The search results indicate that the exemptions were part of bilateral agreements with each country, so the pause on Mexican tariffs was a specific action towards Mexico [4][5][15]. \n\nAdditionally, the updates mention that judicial actions not initiated by Trump don't qualify, but if the administration complies with a court order, it does. There's no mention of court orders here, so the March and April actions were executive decisions, thus valid. \n\nTherefore, since Trump did take executive actions to delay and indefinitely pause tariffs on Mexican imports (specifically USMCA-compliant goods) before May 31, the answer should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

However, these were initially suspended for 30 days after negotiations, pushing the effective date to March 4 [11][16]. \n\nOn March 6, Trump delayed tariffs on USMCA-compliant goods from Mexico and Canada until April 2 [2][4][5][15][16]. This delay was later extended indefinitely on April 2, meaning USMCA-compliant goods would not face the 25% tariff [3][12][16]. Additionally, on April 11, Trump threatened new tariffs over water rights but didn't implement them immediately [1][16]. \n\nThe critical point here is the March 6 delay and the April 2 indefinite extension. The March 6 action specifically paused tariffs on USMCA-compliant Mexican imports, which qualifies as a \"pause\" or \"delay\" under the resolution conditions. The April 2 extension further continued this exemption. Since these actions were executive decisions by the Trump administration, they meet the criteria outlined in the ancillary data. \n\nHowever, I need to check if these actions were specifically targeting Mexico. The USMCA exemptions applied to both Canada and Mexico, but the resolution conditions state that only actions targeting Mexico count. The search results indicate that the exemptions were part of bilateral agreements with each country, so the pause on Mexican tariffs was a specific action towards Mexico [4][5][15]. \n\nAdditionally, the updates mention that judicial actions not initiated by Trump don't qualify, but if the administration complies with a court order, it does. There's no mention of court orders here, so the March and April actions were executive decisions, thus valid. \n\nTherefore, since Trump did take executive actions to delay and indefinitely pause tariffs on Mexican imports (specifically USMCA-compliant goods) before May 31, the answer should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0, ID: 57213996762050644984886725348198288738819184778315389123423704558910246078501, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 1, ID: 91093434551551329991828850505040772413290165797236306323004769531972478452848, Winner: Yes\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

The ancillary data defines that the market resolves to \"Yes\" if Trump takes any executive action or signs legislation that lowers, pauses, delays, or removes tariffs on Mexican imports by the deadline. It's important to note that only actions specifically targeting Mexico count, not general tariff changes. Also, item-specific exemptions don't qualify.\n\nFirst, I need to review the provided search results to see if there's any information about Trump's actions regarding tariffs on Mexico up to the current date, which is June 9, 2025. The user's timestamp is 2025-06-09 18:12:01 UTC, so the deadline of May 31 has already passed. The task is to determine if any qualifying actions occurred before May 31.\n\nLooking at the search results:\n\n1. **Search Result [1]**: Mentions that on March 4, 2025, the U.S. implemented tariffs but later delayed some for USMCA-compliant goods. On March 7, CBP stated no additional tariffs on USMCA-compliant goods. This pause was extended indefinitely as per [11], which says the suspension started on March 7 with no end date. However, the White House indicated it was a pause until April 2 when reciprocal tariffs would take effect. But the actual executive order didn't specify an end date.\n\n2. **Search Result [4]**: CBP's statement on March 8, 2025, confirms that from March 7, no additional tariffs on USMCA-compliant goods. This is a specific action targeting Mexico and Canada, as it's tied to USMCA compliance.\n\n3. **Search Result [10]**: On March 6, Trump paused tariffs on USMCA goods from Mexico until April 2. Later, this was extended to all USMCA goods from both Mexico and Canada [16]. However, the executive order for the suspension didn't set an end date, making it indefinite until further notice.\n\n4. **Search Result [11]**: The White House announced a temporary indefinite suspension starting March 7, 2025, for USMCA-compliant goods. Although officials mentioned it was a pause until April 2, the executive order itself had no expiration, meaning the suspension was in effect unless revoked.\n\n5. **Search Result [14]**: On April 29, 2025, Trump modified tariffs, eliminating cumulative tariffs and providing rebates for the automotive sector. This specifically affected Mexico by reducing the average tariff from 18.2% to 13.9%. This action was a direct reduction targeting Mexico, especially in the automotive industry.\n\n6. **Search Result [15]**: The April 2, 2025, executive order introduced a 10% global tariff but exempted USMCA-compliant goods. However, non-compliant Mexican goods still faced the earlier 25% tariffs. The April 29 modifications in [14] would further adjust these.\n\nNow, considering the resolution conditions:\n\n- The market resolves to \"Yes\" if Trump took any qualifying action by May 31. The key actions are the March 7 suspension of tariffs on USMCA goods and the April 29 adjustments. Both are executive actions that specifically target Mexico (and Canada) by reducing or pausing tariffs. The March 7 action was a pause, and the April 29 action was a reduction. \n\n- The user's update mentions that even if the administration ceases enforcement due to a court order, it counts. However, in this case, the actions were proactive by the administration, not just compliance with a court order.\n\n- The April 29 modification in [14] explicitly lowers tariffs for Mexico by removing cumulative tariffs, which fits the \"lowers\" criterion. This occurred before May 31, so it qualifies.\n\nTherefore, there were at least two instances where Trump's administration took actions that qualify: the March 7 indefinite pause on USMCA goods and the April 29 tariff reduction. Both are executive actions targeting Mexico specifically, meeting the resolution conditions. Thus, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749492721 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-09 18:12:01 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p2.
