      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the match between Lynn Vision and Legacy at the BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025. The key here is to determine the outcome based on verified facts and the provided sources.\n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The current timestamp is June 3, 2025, 18:42 UTC, and the match is scheduled for June 3, 2025, at 1:30 PM ET, which is 17:30 UTC. Wait, the current time is 18:42 UTC, which is after the match's scheduled time. So the event should have already occurred. But according to the search results, the match is listed as upcoming on HLTV and other sources. That's confusing. Maybe the sources haven't been updated yet, or there's a delay. \n\nLooking at the search results, specifically result [3] from Liquipedia, it mentions the match between Lynn Vision and Legacy on June 3, 2025, at 10:45 PDT, which converts to 17:45 UTC. The current time is 18:42 UTC, so the match should have started an hour ago. However, none of the sources provide the actual result yet. All the predictions and previews suggest it's upcoming, but no live scores or results are present. \n\nThe user provided ancillary data where p1 is Legacy, p2 is Lynn Vision, and p3 is 50-50. The resolution source is HLTV. Checking HLTV's event page (result [1] and [9]), there's no updated result for this specific match. The match is part of the Stage 1 Swiss round, but the results aren't listed yet. \n\nSince the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, but no verifiable outcome is available, the instructions say to assume the most probable outcome based on conditions unless contradicted. The predictions from sources like [4], [5], and [8] favor Legacy, with Strafe users giving them a 72.4% chance. However, without official confirmation, we can't be certain. \n\nAdditionally, the user's personalization instructions state that if the event is in the past and no info is available, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But since the match was supposed to happen today and there's no result, it's possible it's delayed. However, the user's cutoff for delay is June 28, 2025, which is far in the future. Without any info on cancellation or delay, but the match time has passed without results, the safest resolution is p3 (50-50) as per the ancillary data. But wait, the resolution conditions say if delayed beyond June 28, resolve to p3. Since the current date is June 3, and the match was today, if it's delayed but not beyond June 28, we might still wait. However, without any info on delay, and the match time has passed, but no result, perhaps it's considered unresolved. \n\nBut according to the instructions, if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The predictions heavily favor Legacy, so maybe p1. But the strict rule is to check official sources. Since HLTV doesn't show the result yet, maybe it's too soon, and the match is still ongoing or the result isn't updated. In that case, we should wait, but the oracle needs to resolve now. \n\nGiven the conflict between the scheduled time and lack of results, and the instruction to default to p4 if unresolved, but the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, the ancillary data defines p3 as 50-50 for tie, canceled, or delayed beyond June 28. Since the delay isn't beyond June 28 yet, but the match hasn't occurred, perhaps it's considered delayed. But without official info, it's unclear. \n\nThis is tricky. The correct approach is to check the official source (HLTV) as per the resolution conditions. Since HLTV doesn't list the result yet, and the match time has passed, but there's no update, we can't confirm the outcome. Therefore, the resolution should be p3 (50-50) as per the ancillary data's condition if the match is canceled or delayed. However, the delay isn't beyond June 28, so maybe it's still pending. But the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since Legacy was favored, maybe p1. But without official confirmation, it's risky. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" So even if the official result isn't out, we go with the probable outcome. The predictions and analysis in the sources suggest Legacy is more likely to win. Therefore, the recommendation would be p1 (Legacy). But I need to be certain. \n\nHowever, the strict rule is to use the official source. If HLTV hasn't updated, maybe the match is still ongoing or the result isn't in. But given the time has passed, and no result, perhaps it's safer to go with p3. But the user's instruction says to assume the probable outcome if no info. Since the ancillary data defines p3 as 50-50 for tie, canceled, or delayed beyond June 28. Since the delay isn't beyond that date, but the match was today, perhaps it's considered unresolved, leading to p4. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome... unless explicitly contradicted.\" But the resolution conditions in the ancillary data say p3 is for tie, canceled, or delayed beyond June 28. Since the match was today and hasn't been reported, it's possible it's delayed but not beyond June 28, so p3 doesn't apply. Therefore, the resolution should be based on the most probable outcome, which is Legacy (p1). \n\nBut I'm not 100% sure. The sources [4], [5], [8] all predict Legacy as the favorite. Therefore, following the user's instruction to assume the probable outcome when no official info is available, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the match between Lynn Vision and Legacy at the BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025. The key here is to determine the outcome based on verified facts and the provided sources.\n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The current timestamp is June 3, 2025, 18:42 UTC, and the match is scheduled for June 3, 2025, at 1:30 PM ET, which is 17:30 UTC. Wait, the current time is 18:42 UTC, which is after the match's scheduled time. So the event should have already occurred. But according to the search results, the match is listed as upcoming on HLTV and other sources. That's confusing. Maybe the sources haven't been updated yet, or there's a delay. \n\nLooking at the search results, specifically result [3] from Liquipedia, it mentions the match between Lynn Vision and Legacy on June 3, 2025, at 10:45 PDT, which converts to 17:45 UTC. The current time is 18:42 UTC, so the match should have started an hour ago. However, none of the sources provide the actual result yet. All the predictions and previews suggest it's upcoming, but no live scores or results are present. \n\nThe user provided ancillary data where p1 is Legacy, p2 is Lynn Vision, and p3 is 50-50. The resolution source is HLTV. Checking HLTV's event page (result [1] and [9]), there's no updated result for this specific match. The match is part of the Stage 1 Swiss round, but the results aren't listed yet. \n\nSince the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, but no verifiable outcome is available, the instructions say to assume the most probable outcome based on conditions unless contradicted. The predictions from sources like [4], [5], and [8] favor Legacy, with Strafe users giving them a 72.4% chance. However, without official confirmation, we can't be certain. \n\nAdditionally, the user's personalization instructions state that if the event is in the past and no info is available, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But since the match was supposed to happen today and there's no result, it's possible it's delayed. However, the user's cutoff for delay is June 28, 2025, which is far in the future. Without any info on cancellation or delay, but the match time has passed without results, the safest resolution is p3 (50-50) as per the ancillary data. But wait, the resolution conditions say if delayed beyond June 28, resolve to p3. Since the current date is June 3, and the match was today, if it's delayed but not beyond June 28, we might still wait. However, without any info on delay, and the match time has passed, but no result, perhaps it's considered unresolved. \n\nBut according to the instructions, if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The predictions heavily favor Legacy, so maybe p1. But the strict rule is to check official sources. Since HLTV doesn't show the result yet, maybe it's too soon, and the match is still ongoing or the result isn't updated. In that case, we should wait, but the oracle needs to resolve now. \n\nGiven the conflict between the scheduled time and lack of results, and the instruction to default to p4 if unresolved, but the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, the ancillary data defines p3 as 50-50 for tie, canceled, or delayed beyond June 28. Since the delay isn't beyond June 28 yet, but the match hasn't occurred, perhaps it's considered delayed. But without official info, it's unclear. \n\nThis is tricky. The correct approach is to check the official source (HLTV) as per the resolution conditions. Since HLTV doesn't list the result yet, and the match time has passed, but there's no update, we can't confirm the outcome. Therefore, the resolution should be p3 (50-50) as per the ancillary data's condition if the match is canceled or delayed. However, the delay isn't beyond June 28, so maybe it's still pending. But the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since Legacy was favored, maybe p1. But without official confirmation, it's risky. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" So even if the official result isn't out, we go with the probable outcome. The predictions and analysis in the sources suggest Legacy is more likely to win. Therefore, the recommendation would be p1 (Legacy). But I need to be certain. \n\nHowever, the strict rule is to use the official source. If HLTV hasn't updated, maybe the match is still ongoing or the result isn't in. But given the time has passed, and no result, perhaps it's safer to go with p3. But the user's instruction says to assume the probable outcome if no info. Since the ancillary data defines p3 as 50-50 for tie, canceled, or delayed beyond June 28. Since the delay isn't beyond that date, but the match was today, perhaps it's considered unresolved, leading to p4. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome... unless explicitly contradicted.\" But the resolution conditions in the ancillary data say p3 is for tie, canceled, or delayed beyond June 28. Since the match was today and hasn't been reported, it's possible it's delayed but not beyond June 28, so p3 doesn't apply. Therefore, the resolution should be based on the most probable outcome, which is Legacy (p1). \n\nBut I'm not 100% sure. The sources [4], [5], [8] all predict Legacy as the favorite. Therefore, following the user's instruction to assume the probable outcome when no official info is available, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Lynn Vision, Price: 0.765, ID: 76032835468355109498938683549357352617463960994338615276146194304947710638011, Winner: No\n- Token: Legacy, Price: 0.235, ID: 97328084502336134368045631962513295429248484974508348237243842989990838402984, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Legacy, p2 to Lynn Vision, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Legacy, p2 = Lynn Vision\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Lynn Vision outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.765 = 76.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Given the user's instruction to use the provided search results and the ancillary data, the correct resolution is p2 (Lynn Vision).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Lynn Vision, Price: 0.765, ID: 76032835468355109498938683549357352617463960994338615276146194304947710638011, Winner: No\n- Token: Legacy, Price: 0.235, ID: 97328084502336134368045631962513295429248484974508348237243842989990838402984, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Legacy, p2 to Lynn Vision, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Legacy, p2 = Lynn Vision\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Lynn Vision outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.765 = 76.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
