      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the French Open women's final between Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff on June 7, 2025. The current date is June 7, 2025, so the event has already taken place. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided to determine who won the match. The search results include multiple sources like news articles and live updates. Let me go through them.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the match is ongoing or provide live updates. For example, result [1] from The Telegraph mentions the score as Sabalenka 7-6, 2-6, 3-3 Gauff* in the final set. Result [6] from Independent.co.uk states the score is Gauff* 6-7(5), 6-2, 0-1. Another result [67] from the Canadian Press reports that Gauff leveled the match by winning the second set 6-2, leading to a deciding third set. However, none of the provided search results explicitly state the final outcome of the match. \n\nSome sources, like [39] from the Associated Press, mention that Sabalenka won the first set 7-6(5), but the second set was taken by Gauff. The third set is ongoing, but there's no conclusion. Other live blogs, such as [70] from Independent.co.uk, show the third set is in progress with Sabalenka leading 0-1. \n\nSince the current timestamp is June 7, 2025, 16:06:59 UTC, and the match was scheduled for 9:00 AM ET (which is 13:00 UTC), the match should have concluded by now. However, the search results don't provide a final result. The user's personalization instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is available, we should assume the most probable outcome based on conditions unless contradicted by sources. \n\nGiven the head-to-head is 5-5, and their last meeting on clay was won by Sabalenka in Madrid, but the sources don't confirm the result. Since the event date has passed but there's no conclusive information, the resolution should default to p4 (unknown/50-50). However, the user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. But without any sources confirming the result, it's safer to resolve to p3 (50-50). Wait, the resolution conditions here are p1: Gauff, p2: Sabalenka, p3: 50-50. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, the search results don't show a winner, so we can't verify. Therefore, the recommendation should be p3 (50-50). But wait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But the ancillary data says if the match is delayed beyond June 17, resolve to 50-50. Since today is June 7, the match wasn't delayed beyond June 17, so that condition doesn't apply. However, the match was on June 7, and if it's completed but no sources confirm the result, we might have to go with p3. But the problem is the search results don't have the final result. They only show the match in progress. Therefore, since the event date is today and the current time is 16:06 UTC, which is after the scheduled start time, but the match might still be ongoing. However, without a confirmed result, we can't resolve it yet. Wait, the user's personalization says if the event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it's still a future event. But here, the event was at 9 AM ET (13:00 UTC), and the current time is 16:06 UTC, which is after the event's start time. However, the match might have concluded, but the search results don't show the final result. Since the sources don't confirm the winner, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, but no verifiable outcome is available, the resolution should be p3 (50-50). However, the user's instruction says if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. But how to determine that? The head-to-head is 5-5, and their last match on clay was won by Sabalenka. But without knowing the actual result, it's speculative. Therefore, the correct resolution is p3 (50-50) because the outcome isn't verified. But wait, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no verifiable information, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But the problem is that the search results don't confirm the result, so we can't assume. Therefore, the recommendation should be p3 (50-50). However, looking back at the search results, some sources like [1] and [6] mention the match is in the third set, but no conclusion. Since the event is over, but no sources report the result, it's possible the match was postponed or the result isn't available. Therefore, the resolution should be p3. But the user's ancillary data says if the match is delayed beyond June 17, resolve to 50-50. Since today is June 7, that's not the case. Therefore, if the match was completed but no sources confirm, we have to resolve as per available info. However, the search results don't have the final result, so we can't confirm. Hence, the recommendation is p3.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3",

The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the French Open women's final between Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff on June 7, 2025. The current date is June 7, 2025, so the event has already taken place. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided to determine who won the match. The search results include multiple sources like news articles and live updates. Let me go through them.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the match is ongoing or provide live updates. For example, result [1] from The Telegraph mentions the score as Sabalenka 7-6, 2-6, 3-3 Gauff* in the final set. Result [6] from Independent.co.uk states the score is Gauff* 6-7(5), 6-2, 0-1. Another result [67] from the Canadian Press reports that Gauff leveled the match by winning the second set 6-2, leading to a deciding third set. However, none of the provided search results explicitly state the final outcome of the match. \n\nSome sources, like [39] from the Associated Press, mention that Sabalenka won the first set 7-6(5), but the second set was taken by Gauff. The third set is ongoing, but there's no conclusion. Other live blogs, such as [70] from Independent.co.uk, show the third set is in progress with Sabalenka leading 0-1. \n\nSince the current timestamp is June 7, 2025, 16:06:59 UTC, and the match was scheduled for 9:00 AM ET (which is 13:00 UTC), the match should have concluded by now. However, the search results don't provide a final result. The user's personalization instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is available, we should assume the most probable outcome based on conditions unless contradicted by sources. \n\nGiven the head-to-head is 5-5, and their last meeting on clay was won by Sabalenka in Madrid, but the sources don't confirm the result. Since the event date has passed but there's no conclusive information, the resolution should default to p4 (unknown/50-50). However, the user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. But without any sources confirming the result, it's safer to resolve to p3 (50-50). Wait, the resolution conditions here are p1: Gauff, p2: Sabalenka, p3: 50-50. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, the search results don't show a winner, so we can't verify. Therefore, the recommendation should be p3 (50-50). But wait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But the ancillary data says if the match is delayed beyond June 17, resolve to 50-50. Since today is June 7, the match wasn't delayed beyond June 17, so that condition doesn't apply. However, the match was on June 7, and if it's completed but no sources confirm the result, we might have to go with p3. But the problem is the search results don't have the final result. They only show the match in progress. Therefore, since the event date is today and the current time is 16:06 UTC, which is after the scheduled start time, but the match might still be ongoing. However, without a confirmed result, we can't resolve it yet. Wait, the user's personalization says if the event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it's still a future event. But here, the event was at 9 AM ET (13:00 UTC), and the current time is 16:06 UTC, which is after the event's start time. However, the match might have concluded, but the search results don't show the final result. Since the sources don't confirm the winner, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, but no verifiable outcome is available, the resolution should be p3 (50-50). However, the user's instruction says if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. But how to determine that? The head-to-head is 5-5, and their last match on clay was won by Sabalenka. But without knowing the actual result, it's speculative. Therefore, the correct resolution is p3 (50-50) because the outcome isn't verified. But wait, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no verifiable information, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But the problem is that the search results don't confirm the result, so we can't assume. Therefore, the recommendation should be p3 (50-50). However, looking back at the search results, some sources like [1] and [6] mention the match is in the third set, but no conclusion. Since the event is over, but no sources report the result, it's possible the match was postponed or the result isn't available. Therefore, the resolution should be p3. But the user's ancillary data says if the match is delayed beyond June 17, resolve to 50-50. Since today is June 7, that's not the case. Therefore, if the match was completed but no sources confirm, we have to resolve as per available info. However, the search results don't have the final result, so we can't confirm. Hence, the recommendation is p3.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Sabalenka, Price: 0.24, ID: 25451238150863515333969181288535630199336889377284672220432066248827969632727, Winner: No\n- Token: Gauff , Price: 0.76, ID: 26434610504307573983932115914357638882927260157595250386936324690741286625199, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Gauff , p2 to Sabalenka, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Gauff, p2 = Sabalenka\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Gauff  outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.760 = 76.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the outcome of the French Open 2025 women's final between Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff. The event date is June 7, 2025, and the current timestamp is June 7, 2025, 16:06:59 UTC. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already occurred. Since the current date is the same as the event date, I should verify the match's status. The user provided multiple search results, some of which are live updates from the final. \n\nLooking at the search results, especially [21], [26], [53], and [66], there are detailed live updates. For instance, [21] mentions that Sabalenka won the first set 7-6(5), Gauff took the second set 6-2, and they were into the third set. Another source, [66], confirms that Sabalenka won the first set 7-6(5) and Gauff the second 6-2, leading to a deciding third set. \n\nThe key point is determining the final outcome. The latest updates in the search results don't show the conclusion, but some sources like [66] are from the Associated Press and mention that Sabalenka won the first set and Gauff the second. However, without a final result reported in the provided sources, I might need to infer based on the most probable outcome. However, the user's personalization instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions unless contradicted by sources. \n\nWait, but the current timestamp is June 7, 2025, 16:06 UTC, and the match was scheduled for 9:00 AM ET (which is 13:00 UTC). So the match would have started and possibly concluded by the current time. However, the search results include live blogs that might not have the final result. For example, [66] is an AP report that says Sabalenka won the first set, Gauff the second, and they were in the third, but it doesn't conclude. However, some sources like [21] and [53] indicate the match went to a third set, but without the final result. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to use the primary source (French Open official site) if possible. However, none of the provided search results include the official Roland Garros site. The sources are news outlets. The user also says to avoid speculative conclusions and focus on verified outcomes. Since the search results don't provide the final result, but the event date is in the past, and the user instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if no info is available. However, the ancillary data defines p2 as Sabalenka winning. \n\nWait, but the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" Since the event date is today, but the current time is after the match's start time, but the sources don't show the final result, perhaps the match is still ongoing. However, the user's current time is 4:06 PM UTC, and the match started at 9 AM ET (1 PM UTC). So it's been over 3 hours. A typical women's final might take around 2 hours, so it's possible the match has concluded. \n\nBut the provided search results don't have the final result. Some sources like [66] mention the third set is ongoing but don't conclude. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, if no verifiable outcome is available, and the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. However, the ancillary data's resolution conditions say p3 is 50-50 if the match is delayed beyond June 17, which isn't the case here. Since the match was scheduled for June 7 and it's the same day, but the outcome isn't clear from the sources, perhaps the resolution should be p3. However, the user's personalization also says, \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\" The primary source is supposed to be the French Open official site, but it's not in the search results. \n\nGiven that the search results don't include the official result, but some sources like [66] (AP) are credible and report the match is in the third set without conclusion, and others like [21] and [53] also don't show the final result, I can't definitively determine the winner. However, the user's instruction says if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. But the ancillary data's p3 is for canceled or delayed beyond June 17, which isn't the case. The match was played on June 7, so if it's completed but no result in sources, perhaps it's unresolved. However, the user's personalization says to focus on the primary source (French Open site), but it's not provided. \n\nWait, the user's query includes ancillary data specifying the primary resolution source is the French Open official site, but the provided search results don't include that. However, the user's personalization says to \"focus on obtaining conclusive results from the primary source specified in the query (French Open official site) and avoid speculative conclusions.\" Since the search results don't include the official site, but the user provided other sources, perhaps the resolution should be p3 (unknown) because the available sources don't confirm the result.

Wait, looking at [66], it's an AP report that says Sabalenka won the first set, Gauff the second, and they are in the third. But the provided text doesn't show the conclusion. Since the user's current time is after the match's scheduled time, but the sources don't have the result, perhaps the resolution is p3.

Since the primary source isn't available in the search results, and the other sources don't confirm the result, the resolution should be p3. But the user's instruction also says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThis is conflicting. However, the user's personalization emphasizes avoiding speculation and using verified outcomes. Since the available sources don't confirm the result, even though the event date is in the past, the correct resolution would be p3. But wait, the ancillary data says if the match is delayed beyond June 17, resolve to p3. Since the match was on June 7 and it's June 7, that condition isn't met. Therefore, if the match was played but the result isn't available in the sources, perhaps it's unresolved, but the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant should check the latest search results. For example, [53] from India Today mentions that in the third set, Gauff leads 5-4, but it's not conclusive. [66] from AP also doesn't conclude. Since none of the provided sources have the final result, the resolution should be p3. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without knowing, it's unclear. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" The ancillary data's resolution conditions have p2 as Sabalenka. If the most probable outcome is Sabalenka, then p2. But how to determine the most probable? The search results mention Sabalenka's strong performance, especially her win over Swiatek, and some experts predicting her victory. For example, [51] has experts favoring Sabalenka. Also, [59] mentions Sabalenka as the favorite. \n\nTherefore, considering the available information and the instruction to assume the most probable outcome if no verifiable info is present, the resolution would be p2 (Sabalenka). However, the user also said to avoid speculation and use primary sources. Since the primary source isn't available, but the ancillary data's resolution conditions don't have p3 for this scenario (only if delayed beyond June 17 or canceled), the correct resolution is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Clarify the recommendation based on verified outcomes.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the outcome of the French Open 2025 women's final between Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff. The event date is June 7, 2025, and the current timestamp is June 7, 2025, 16:06:59 UTC. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already occurred. Since the current date is the same as the event date, I should verify the match's status. The user provided multiple search results, some of which are live updates from the final. \n\nLooking at the search results, especially [21], [26], [53], and [66], there are detailed live updates. For instance, [21] mentions that Sabalenka won the first set 7-6(5), Gauff took the second set 6-2, and they were into the third set. Another source, [66], confirms that Sabalenka won the first set 7-6(5) and Gauff the second 6-2, leading to a deciding third set. \n\nThe key point is determining the final outcome. The latest updates in the search results don't show the conclusion, but some sources like [66] are from the Associated Press and mention that Sabalenka won the first set and Gauff the second. However, without a final result reported in the provided sources, I might need to infer based on the most probable outcome. However, the user's personalization instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions unless contradicted by sources. \n\nWait, but the current timestamp is June 7, 2025, 16:06 UTC, and the match was scheduled for 9:00 AM ET (which is 13:00 UTC). So the match would have started and possibly concluded by the current time. However, the search results include live blogs that might not have the final result. For example, [66] is an AP report that says Sabalenka won the first set, Gauff the second, and they were in the third, but it doesn't conclude. However, some sources like [21] and [53] indicate the match went to a third set, but without the final result. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to use the primary source (French Open official site) if possible. However, none of the provided search results include the official Roland Garros site. The sources are news outlets. The user also says to avoid speculative conclusions and focus on verified outcomes. Since the search results don't provide the final result, but the event date is in the past, and the user instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if no info is available. However, the ancillary data defines p2 as Sabalenka winning. \n\nWait, but the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" Since the event date is today, but the current time is after the match's start time, but the sources don't show the final result, perhaps the match is still ongoing. However, the user's current time is 4:06 PM UTC, and the match started at 9 AM ET (1 PM UTC). So it's been over 3 hours. A typical women's final might take around 2 hours, so it's possible the match has concluded. \n\nBut the provided search results don't have the final result. Some sources like [66] mention the third set is ongoing but don't conclude. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, if no verifiable outcome is available, and the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. However, the ancillary data's resolution conditions say p3 is 50-50 if the match is delayed beyond June 17, which isn't the case here. Since the match was scheduled for June 7 and it's the same day, but the outcome isn't clear from the sources, perhaps the resolution should be p3. However, the user's personalization also says, \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\" The primary source is supposed to be the French Open official site, but it's not in the search results. \n\nGiven that the search results don't include the official result, but some sources like [66] (AP) are credible and report the match is in the third set without conclusion, and others like [21] and [53] also don't show the final result, I can't definitively determine the winner. However, the user's instruction says if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. But the ancillary data's p3 is for canceled or delayed beyond June 17, which isn't the case. The match was played on June 7, so if it's completed but no result in sources, perhaps it's unresolved. However, the user's personalization says to focus on the primary source (French Open site), but it's not provided. \n\nWait, the user's query includes ancillary data specifying the primary resolution source is the French Open official site, but the provided search results don't include that. However, the user's personalization says to \"focus on obtaining conclusive results from the primary source specified in the query (French Open official site) and avoid speculative conclusions.\" Since the search results don't include the official site, but the user provided other sources, perhaps the resolution should be p3 (unknown) because the available sources don't confirm the result.

However, the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome.

However, the ancillary data's p2 is Sabalenka, p1 is Gauff. The user's personalization says to avoid speculative conclusions and use primary sources. Since the primary source isn't available in the search results, and the other sources don't confirm the result, the resolution should be p3. But the user's instruction also says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThis is conflicting.

Where p1 corresponds to Gauff , p2 to Sabalenka, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Gauff, p2 = Sabalenka\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Gauff  outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.760 = 76.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the outcome of the French Open 2025 women's singles final between Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff. The event date is June 7, 2025, which is the same as the current timestamp provided (2025-06-07 16:06:59 UTC). The user specified that the primary resolution source should be the French Open official site, and if no conclusive info is there, default to p4. But wait, the resolution conditions here are p1 for Gauff, p2 for Sabalenka, p3 for 50-50. Wait, the user mentioned p4 in the personalization, but the ancillary data here uses p1, p2, p3. Need to check that.\n\nFirst, confirm the event date. The match was scheduled for June 7, 2025, at 9:00 AM ET. The current timestamp is June 7, 2025, 16:06 UTC, which is 12:06 PM ET. So the match has already started and likely concluded, given the live updates in the search results. The user provided several search results, including live blogs and news articles up to June 7, 2025, indicating the match occurred and concluded.\n\nLooking at the search results, especially [3], [4], [6], [7], [9], [10], [16], [18], there are live updates. For example, result [3] mentions Gauff winning the second set 6-2, forcing a deciding third set. Result [4] from Independent.co.uk states that Gauff won the final 6-7, 6-2, 6-4. Similarly, [10] on the same site confirms Gauff's victory. The Telegraph in [9] also reports Gauff's win. The Roland Garros live blog in [18] details the third set where Gauff broke Sabalenka to lead 2-1 and eventually won.\n\nThe primary source, Roland Garros official site (rolandgarros.com), is referenced in [14], [15], [17], [18]. However, the provided search results don't include a direct link to the official result on their site. But multiple credible news sources (The Independent, CBS Sports, ESPN, etc.) report Gauff's victory. According to the resolution conditions, if the official site isn't available, a consensus of credible reporting can be used. Since all the search results point to Gauff winning, the resolution should be p1 (Gauff). \n\nNeed to ensure there's no conflicting info. All sources agree on the outcome: Gauff wins in three sets. Sabalenka took the first set in a tiebreak, Gauff dominated the second, and clinched the third. No mentions of the match being canceled or delayed beyond June 17. Therefore, the resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Where p1 corresponds to Gauff , p2 to Sabalenka, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Gauff, p2 = Sabalenka\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Gauff  outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.760 = 76.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749312419 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-07 16:06:59 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please focus on obtaining conclusive results from the primary source specified in the query (French Open official site) and avoid speculative conclusions. Clarify the recommendation based on verified outcomes."
