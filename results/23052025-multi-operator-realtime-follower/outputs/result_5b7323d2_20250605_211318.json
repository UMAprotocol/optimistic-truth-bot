Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\"), college football (e.g., \"What was the score of the Alabama game last Saturday?\"), college basketball (e.g., \"What was Duke's score in their last game?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",

Try the proxy endpoint first (better reliability)\n       2. If proxy fails (timeout, error response, etc.), automatically fall back to the primary endpoint\n       3. Your code MUST handle this gracefully with try/except blocks\n\n     Example fallback code structure:\n     ```python\n     def get_data(symbol, start_time, end_time):\n         try:\n             # First try the proxy endpoint\n             response = requests.get(f\"{proxy_url}?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n         except Exception as e:\n             print(f\"Proxy endpoint failed: {str(e)}, falling back to primary endpoint\")\n             # Fall back to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n             response = requests.get(f\"{primary_url}/klines?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n     ```\n     \n6. NEVER include actual API key values in the code, always load them from environment variables.\n\n7. IMPORTANT FOR ALL DATA SOURCES: If a proxy endpoint is provided alongside a primary endpoint, you MUST implement the fallback mechanism described above. This is critical for reliability:\n   - Always try the proxy endpoint first\n   - If the proxy fails, fall back to the primary endpoint\n   - Use appropriate timeout values (10 seconds recommended)\n   - Include proper error handling with try/except blocks\n\nThe code should be completely self-contained and runnable with no arguments.\n\n\nHere's a complete code example that shows how to solve this type of problem:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Note: Binance public API doesn't require an API key for basic price queries\n# However, if we need rate limits increased or private endpoints, we would use these:\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\nBINANCE_API_SECRET = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\")\n\n# Sensitive data patterns to mask in logs\nSENSITIVE_PATTERNS = [\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_KEY\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    #

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Bitcoin Up or Down - June 5, 4 PM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for BTC/USDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the June 5 2025 1 hour candle that begins at 4PM ET. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTC/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT?type=spot). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTC/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 549440\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749157351 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-05 21:02:31 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# API keys loaded from environment variables\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\n\n# Configure logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n\ndef get_binance_data(symbol, interval, start_time, end_time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches data from Binance API with a fallback to a proxy endpoint if the primary fails.\n    \"\"\"\n    proxy_url = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\"\n    primary_url = \"https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines\"\n\n    try:\n        # First try the proxy endpoint\n        response = requests.get(f\"{proxy_url}?symbol={symbol}&interval={interval}&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n        if data:\n            return data[0]\n    except Exception as e:\n        logging.warning(f\"Proxy endpoint failed: {str(e)}, falling back to primary endpoint\")\n        # Fall back to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n        try:\n            response = requests.get(f\"{primary_url}?symbol={symbol}&interval={interval}&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n            response.raise_for_status()\n            data = response.json()\n            if data:\n                return data[0]\n        except Exception as e:\n            logging.error(f\"Primary endpoint also failed: {str(e)}\")\n            raise\n\ndef resolve_market():\n    \"\"\"\n    Resolves the market based on the change in BTC/USDT price from Binance.\n    \"\"\"\n    symbol = \"BTCUSDT\"\n    interval = \"1h\"\n    target_date = datetime(2025, 6, 5, 16, 0, 0, tzinfo=pytz.timezone(\"US/Eastern\"))\n    start_time = int(target_date.timestamp() * 1000)\n    end_time = start_time + 3600000  # 1 hour later\n\n    try:\n        data = get_binance_data(symbol, interval, start_time, end_time)\n        if data:\n            open_price = float(data[1])\n            close_price = float(data[4])\n            change_percentage = ((close_price - open_price) / open_price) * 100\n\n            if change_percentage >= 0:\n                print(\"recommendation: p2\")  # Market resolves to \"Up\"\n            else:\n                print(\"recommendation: p1\")  # Market resolves to \"Down\"\n    except Exception as e:\n        logging.error(f\"Failed to fetch or process data: {e}\")\n        print(\"recommendation: p3\")  # Unknown/50-50 if there's an error\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    resolve_market()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p2\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful. Recommendation found: p2.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p2\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.0005, ID: 5630340021574617120786037469692981094847561746184978150775141772765505777932, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.9995, ID: 32375605415298455623583002361782785782322733970569541434097936513032432000930, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Query Type Specific Information:\n\n   Cryptocurrency Data Sources:\n   - Binance:\n     * primary: https://api.binance.com/api/v3\n     * proxy: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\n     * RECOMMENDED: Use this proxy endpoint first for better reliability\n     * Example: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy?symbol=BTCUSDT&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime=TIMESTAMP&endTime=TIMESTAMP\n\n     * CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Since a proxy endpoint is provided, you MUST implement a fallback mechanism:\n       1. Try the proxy endpoint first (better reliability)\n       2. If proxy fails (timeout, error response, etc.), automatically fall back to the primary endpoint\n       3. Your code MUST handle this gracefully with try/except blocks\n\n     Example fallback code structure:\n     ```python\n     def get_data(symbol, start_time, end_time):\n         try:\n             # First try the proxy endpoint\n             response = requests.get(f\"{proxy_url}?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n         except Exception as e:\n             print(f\"Proxy endpoint failed: {str(e)}, falling back to primary endpoint\")\n             # Fall back to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n             response = requests.get(f\"{primary_url}/klines?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n     ```\n     \n6. NEVER include actual API key values in the code, always load them from environment variables.\n\n7. IMPORTANT FOR ALL DATA SOURCES: If a proxy endpoint is provided alongside a primary endpoint, you MUST implement the fallback mechanism described above. This is critical for reliability:\n   - Always try the proxy endpoint first\n   - If the proxy fails, fall back to the primary endpoint\n   - Use appropriate timeout values (10 seconds recommended)\n   - Include proper error handling with try/except blocks\n\nThe code should be completely self-contained and runnable with no arguments.\n\n\nHere's a complete code example that shows how to solve this type of problem:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Note: Binance public API doesn't require an API key for basic price queries\n# However, if we need rate limits increased or private endpoints, we would use these:\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\nBINANCE_API_SECRET = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\")\n\n# Sensitive data patterns to mask in logs\nSENSITIVE_PATTERNS = [\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_KEY\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    #

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749157351 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-05 21:02:31 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p2. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources.

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

IMPORTANT FOR ALL DATA SOURCES: If a proxy endpoint is provided alongside a primary endpoint, you MUST implement the fallback mechanism described above. This is critical for reliability:\n   - Always try the proxy endpoint first\n   - If the proxy fails, fall back to the primary endpoint\n   - Use appropriate timeout values (10 seconds recommended)\n   - Include proper error handling with try/except blocks\n\nThe code should be completely self-contained and runnable with no arguments.\n\n\nHere's a complete code example that shows how to solve this type of problem:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Note: Binance public API doesn't require an API key for basic price queries\n# However, if we need rate limits increased or private endpoints, we would use these:\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\nBINANCE_API_SECRET = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\")\n\n# Sensitive data patterns to mask in logs\nSENSITIVE_PATTERNS = [\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_KEY\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    #

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Bitcoin Up or Down - June 5, 4 PM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for BTC/USDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the June 5 2025 1 hour candle that begins at 4PM ET. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTC/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT?type=spot). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTC/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 549440\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749157351 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-05 21:02:31 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p2. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Consider integrating market sentiment into the resolution logic when API data retrieval fails, or explore alternative data sources.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# API keys loaded from environment variables\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\n\n# Configure logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\nhandler = logging.StreamHandler()\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nhandler.setFormatter(formatter)\nlogger.addHandler(handler)\n\ndef get_binance_price(symbol, interval, start_time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches price data from Binance API for a specific symbol and interval.\n    \"\"\"\n    proxy_url = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\"\n    primary_url = \"https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines\"\n    \n    params = {\n        \"symbol\": symbol,\n        \"interval\": interval,\n        \"limit\": 1,\n        \"startTime\": start_time,\n        \"endTime\": start_time + 3600000  # 1 hour later\n    }\n    \n    try:\n        # Try proxy endpoint first\n        response = requests.get(proxy_url, params=params)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n        return data[0][4]  # Close price of the candle\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Proxy failed, trying primary endpoint: {e}\")\n        # Fallback to primary endpoint\n        try:\n            response = requests.get(primary_url, params=params)\n            response.raise_for_status()\n            data = response.json()\n            return data[0][4]  # Close price of the candle\n        except Exception as e:\n            logger.error(f\"Both proxy and primary endpoints failed: {e}\")\n            raise\n\ndef resolve_market():\n    \"\"\"\n    Resolves the market based on the price change of BTC/USDT on Binance.\n    \"\"\"\n    symbol = \"BTCUSDT\"\n    interval = \"1h\"\n    target_date = datetime(2025, 6, 5, 16, 0, 0, tzinfo=pytz.timezone(\"US/Eastern\"))\n    target_date_utc = target_date.astimezone(pytz.utc)\n    start_time = int(target_date_utc.timestamp() * 1000)  # Convert to milliseconds\n    \n    try:\n        open_price = get_binance_price(symbol, interval, start_time)\n        close_price = get_binance_price(symbol, interval, start_time + 3600000)  # Next hour candle\n        \n        open_price = float(open_price)\n        close_price = float(close_price)\n        \n        if close_price >= open_price:\n            logger.info(\"Market resolves to Up.\")\n            return \"recommendation: p2\"  # Up\n        else:\n            logger.info(\"Market resolves to Down.\")\n            return \"recommendation: p1\"  # Down\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Failed to resolve market: {e}\")\n        return \"recommendation: p3\"  # Unknown/50-50 if data retrieval fails\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    result = resolve_market()\n    print(result)\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p3\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful. Recommendation found: p3.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p3\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.0005, ID: 5630340021574617120786037469692981094847561746184978150775141772765505777932, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.9995, ID: 32375605415298455623583002361782785782322733970569541434097936513032432000930, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve whether Bitcoin (BTC/USDT) was up or down based on the 1-hour candle starting at 4 PM ET on June 5, 2025. The resolution depends on the percentage change displayed on Binance's BTC/USDT spot market graph for that specific candle.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the exact time of the candle. Since it's 4 PM ET, I should convert that to UTC because Binance timestamps are in UTC. ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, so 4 PM ET would be 8 PM UTC. The 1-hour candle from 8 PM to 9 PM UTC on June 5, 2025.\n\nNext, I'll check the provided search results for relevant data. Looking at the search results, several sources mention Binance's BTC/USDT pair. For example, result [18] links directly to the Binance BTC/USDT trading page. Result [1], [2], [7], and others provide price data around the time in question. \n\nResult [4] from Forex24.pro gives a forecast for June 5, 2025, predicting a test of resistance at 107,245 USDT, but this is a forecast and not actual data. The key here is to find the actual percentage change for the specific 1-hour window.\n\nResult [8] and [44] from coinalyze.net mention news up to June 5, 2025, but don't specify the exact 4 PM ET candle. Result [40] from CoinMarketCap shows the BTC to USDT conversion rate history, but the dates listed are up to June 5, 2025, with a 3.60% decrease in the last 24 hours. However, this is a 24-hour change, not the specific 1-hour window needed.\n\nResult [66] from Binance's API documentation explains how to retrieve kline/candlestick data, which includes the percentage change for a specific interval. The user's query specifies using the \"1H\" candle's change value from Binance's graph. \n\nSince the current timestamp is June 5, 2025, 21:02:31 UTC, the 8 PM UTC candle (4 PM ET) would have closed at 9 PM UTC. By the current time (21:02 UTC), the candle has closed, and the data should be available. \n\nLooking at result [1], the current price is 102,306.12 USDT, with a -0.68% change in the past 24 hours. However, this doesn't specify the 1-hour change. Result [2] shows a 1.12% increase as of 07:52 CT (which is UTC-5, so 12:52 UTC), but this is earlier in the day. \n\nResult [4] mentions the price was 105,320 USDT with a bearish trend, but again, this is a forecast. The actual data needs to come from Binance's API or their displayed graph. Since the user provided a direct link to Binance's BTC/USDT spot market (result [18]), the resolution depends on that specific data point.\n\nAssuming the 1-hour candle from 8 PM to 9 PM UTC (4 PM to 5 PM ET) on June 5, 2025, the percentage change would be calculated as ((Close Price - Open Price)/Open Price)*100. If this value is \u22650%, it resolves to \"Up\" (p2); otherwise, \"Down\" (p1).\n\nWithout explicit data points for that exact hour in the provided results, I have to infer based on available information. Result [40] shows a 3.60% decrease over 24 hours, but the specific hour might differ. However, the user's ancillary data specifies using Binance's displayed change for the \"1H\" candle. If the change is \u22650%, p2 (Up) is correct; else, p1 (Down).\n\nGiven the current time is past the candle's close, and assuming the data is available, the resolution would depend on Binance's recorded percentage. If the change is positive or zero, it's Up; negative, Down. Since the user's personalization requires using the provided URLs and current data, and the search results don't explicitly state the exact percentage for that hour, but the overall trend on the day is mixed (some sources show slight decreases, others increases), but the exact hour's data isn't directly provided. However, the user's instructions say to resolve based on the specific candle's change on Binance. \n\nSince the query is about whether the change is \u22650%, and assuming the data from Binance for that hour shows a non-negative change, the resolution would be p2. However, without explicit data in the provided context, I might have to default to p4 if the information isn't available. But the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nGiven the current price in the search results (102,306.12 USDT in [1]) and the 24-hour change being negative, but the specific hour's data isn't clear. However, the user's instructions emphasize using the specific Binance data. If the 1H candle's change is not found in the provided results, but the event date is in the past, and the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome. If the 1H candle closed higher than it opened, then Up. If not, Down. \n\nBut without explicit data, perhaps the answer is p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Given the market's volatility and the provided data points around that time, if the overall trend was bearish (as per result [4] predicting a drop), but the exact hour isn't clear, it's uncertain. However, the user's instructions say to resolve based on Binance's data. Since the search results don't have the exact 1H candle's percentage, but the current time is after the event, and assuming the data is available, the correct approach is to check Binance's data. \n\nBut since the provided context doesn't include the exact percentage for that hour, and the user's personalization requires using the provided sources, which don't explicitly state it, the resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's personalization also says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Given that, and considering the 24-hour change is negative but the specific hour could vary, but without concrete data, it's safer to return p4. However, the user might have access to the data, so perhaps the answer is p2 if the change was \u22650% or p1 otherwise. \n\nWait, the current timestamp is June 5, 2025, 21:02:31 UTC. The candle in question is from 20:00 to 21:00 UTC (4 PM ET to 5 PM ET). Since the current time is 21:02, the candle has just closed. The data should be available. Looking at result [1], the current price is 102,306.12 USDT, down 0.68% in 24h. But the 1-hour change at 21:00 UTC would depend on that hour's movement. If the price at 20:00 was higher than at 21:00, the change is negative. If it increased, positive. \n\nResult [44] from coinalyze.net's live chart on June 5, 2025, at 18:30 UTC mentions BTC dipping to $104,000, but that's earlier. Without the exact data point, but given the user's instructions to use Binance's data, and if the change is not found in the provided sources, the resolution would be p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, result [40] shows the BTC/USDT rate on June 5, 2025, as 100,930.23 USDT, a 3.60% decrease in 24h. But this is the 24h change, not the 1h. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and lack of explicit data for the specific hour, but the event time has passed, the correct resolution is p4. However, the user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. If the market was generally down that day, perhaps the 1h candle was also down. But without concrete data, it's uncertain. \n\nWait, the user's query says the resolution source is the change value displayed at the top of the Binance graph for the 1H candle. If that value is \u22650%, then p2; else p1. Since the provided search results don't include that exact percentage, but the event time has passed, and assuming the data is available on Binance, but not in the provided context, the assistant should return p4. However, the user's personalization says to answer based on the provided search results. Since the search results don't have the exact 1H change, the assistant can't verify, so p4. But the user's personalization also says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nGiven the mixed signals in the search results (some sources show decreases, others fluctuations), but without the exact 1H data, the safest recommendation is p4. However, the user's instructions might expect the assistant to infer from available data. For example, result [1] shows a -0.68% 24h change, but the 1H could be different. If the 1H candle's change is not specified, but the overall trend is slightly negative, maybe the 1H was also negative. But this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, result [4] from Forex24.pro on June 5, 2025, mentions BTC/USDT trading at 105,320 with a bearish trend, expecting a test of 107,245. If during that hour, the price attempted to rise but failed, the change could be negative. However, this is a forecast, not actual data. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit data in the provided context for the specific 1H candle, the correct resolution is p4. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. If the assistant has to assume, perhaps p1 (Down) if the overall trend is down, but this is uncertain. However, per the user's instructions, the assistant must resolve based on the provided sources. Since the sources don't have the exact 1H change, the answer is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749157351 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-05 21:02:31 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve whether Bitcoin (BTC/USDT) was up or down based on the 1-hour candle starting at 4 PM ET on June 5, 2025. The resolution depends on the percentage change displayed on Binance's BTC/USDT spot market graph for that specific candle.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the exact time of the candle. Since it's 4 PM ET, I should convert that to UTC because Binance timestamps are in UTC. ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, so 4 PM ET would be 8 PM UTC. The 1-hour candle from 8 PM to 9 PM UTC on June 5, 2025.\n\nNext, I'll check the provided search results for relevant data. Looking at the search results, several sources mention Binance's BTC/USDT pair. For example, result [18] links directly to the Binance BTC/USDT trading page. Result [1], [2], [7], and others provide price data around the time in question. \n\nResult [4] from Forex24.pro gives a forecast for June 5, 2025, predicting a test of resistance at 107,245 USDT, but this is a forecast and not actual data. The key here is to find the actual percentage change for the specific 1-hour window.\n\nResult [8] and [44] from coinalyze.net mention news up to June 5, 2025, but don't specify the exact 4 PM ET candle. Result [40] from CoinMarketCap shows the BTC to USDT conversion rate history, but the dates listed are up to June 5, 2025, with a 3.60% decrease in the last 24 hours. However, this is a 24-hour change, not the specific 1-hour window needed.\n\nResult [66] from Binance's API documentation explains how to retrieve kline/candlestick data, which includes the percentage change for a specific interval. The user's query specifies using the \"1H\" candle's change value from Binance's graph. \n\nSince the current timestamp is June 5, 2025, 21:02:31 UTC, the 8 PM UTC candle (4 PM ET) would have closed at 9 PM UTC. By the current time (21:02 UTC), the candle has closed, and the data should be available. \n\nLooking at result [1], the current price is 102,306.12 USDT, with a -0.68% change in the past 24 hours. However, this doesn't specify the 1-hour change. Result [2] shows a 1.12% increase as of 07:52 CT (which is UTC-5, so 12:52 UTC), but this is earlier in the day. \n\nResult [4] mentions the price was 105,320 USDT with a bearish trend, but again, this is a forecast. The actual data needs to come from Binance's API or their displayed graph. Since the user provided a direct link to Binance's BTC/USDT spot market (result [18]), the resolution depends on that specific data point.\n\nAssuming the 1-hour candle from 8 PM to 9 PM UTC (4 PM to 5 PM ET) on June 5, 2025, the percentage change would be calculated as ((Close Price - Open Price)/Open Price)*100. If this value is \u22650%, it resolves to \"Up\" (p2); otherwise, \"Down\" (p1).\n\nWithout explicit data points for that exact hour in the provided results, I have to infer based on available information. Result [40] shows a 3.60% decrease over 24 hours, but the specific hour might differ. However, the user's ancillary data specifies using Binance's displayed change for the \"1H\" candle. If the change is \u22650%, p2 (Up) is correct; else, p1 (Down).\n\nGiven the current time is past the candle's close, and assuming the data is available, the resolution would depend on Binance's recorded percentage. If the change is positive or zero, it's Up; negative, Down. Since the user's personalization requires using the provided URLs and current data, and the search results don't explicitly state the exact percentage for that hour, but the overall trend on the day is mixed (some sources show slight decreases, others increases), but the exact hour's data isn't directly provided. However, the user's instructions say to resolve based on the specific candle's change on Binance. \n\nSince the query is about whether the change is \u22650%, and assuming the data from Binance for that hour shows a non-negative change, the resolution would be p2. However, without explicit data in the provided context, I might have to default to p4 if the information isn't available. But the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nGiven the current price in the search results (102,306.12 USDT in [1]) and the 24-hour change being negative, but the specific hour's data isn't clear. However, the user's instructions emphasize using the specific Binance data. If the 1H candle's change is not found in the provided results, but the event date is in the past, and the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome. If the 1H candle closed higher than it opened, then Up. If not, Down. \n\nBut without explicit data, perhaps the answer is p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Given the market's volatility and the provided data points around that time, if the overall trend was bearish (as per result [4] predicting a drop), but the exact hour isn't clear, it's uncertain. However, the user's instructions say to resolve based on Binance's data. Since the search results don't have the exact 1H candle's percentage, but the current time is after the event, and assuming the data is available, the correct approach is to check Binance's data. \n\nBut since the provided context doesn't include the exact percentage for that hour, and the user's personalization requires using the provided sources, which don't explicitly state it, the resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's personalization also says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Given that, and considering the 24-hour change is negative but the specific hour could vary, but without concrete data, it's safer to return p4. However, the user might have access to the data, so perhaps the answer is p2 if the change was \u22650% or p1 otherwise. \n\nWait, the current timestamp is June 5, 2025, 21:02:31 UTC. The candle in question is from 20:00 to 21:00 UTC (4 PM ET to 5 PM ET). Since the current time is 21:02, the candle has just closed. The data should be available. Looking at result [1], the current price is 102,306.12 USDT, down 0.68% in 24h. But the 1-hour change at 21:00 UTC would depend on that hour's movement. If the price at 20:00 was higher than at 21:00, the change is negative. If it increased, positive. \n\nResult [44] from coinalyze.net's live chart on June 5, 2025, at 18:30 UTC mentions BTC dipping to $104,000, but that's earlier. Without the exact data point, but given the user's instructions to use Binance's data, and if the change is not found in the provided sources, the resolution would be p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, result [40] shows the BTC/USDT rate on June 5, 2025, as 100,930.23 USDT, a 3.60% decrease in 24h. But this is the 24h change, not the 1h. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and lack of explicit data for the specific hour, but the event time has passed, the correct resolution is p4. However, the user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. If the market was generally down that day, perhaps the 1h candle was also down. But without concrete data, it's uncertain. \n\nWait, the user's query says the resolution source is the change value displayed at the top of the Binance graph for the 1H candle. If that value is \u22650%, then p2; else p1. Since the provided search results don't include that exact percentage, but the event time has passed, and assuming the data is available on Binance, but not in the provided context, the assistant should return p4. However, the user's personalization says to answer based on the provided search results. Since the search results don't have the exact 1H change, the assistant can't verify, so p4.

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

The user wants to resolve a market based on whether the BTC/USDT 1-hour candle starting at 4 PM ET on June 5, 2025, closes up or down. The resolution depends on the percentage change displayed on Binance's BTC/USDT spot trading page for that specific candle.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the current time. The current timestamp given is June 5, 2025, 21:02:31 UTC. Converting 4 PM ET to UTC, since ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, 4 PM ET would be 20:00 UTC. The candle in question starts at 20:00 UTC and ends at 21:00 UTC. The current time is 21:02 UTC, which is just after the candle closed. So the data should be available now.\n\nNext, I need to check the provided search results for the BTC/USDT 1-hour candle change at that time. Looking through the sources:\n\n- Search result [3] from CoinMarketCap shows the BTC/USDT rate on June 5 as 100,891.72 USDT with a -3.61% change. However, this might be the daily change, not the 1-hour candle.\n  \n- Search result [16] from Coindesk's Crypto Daybook mentions BTC was at $104,909.52 with a -0.79% change over 24 hours as of June 5, but again, this is daily data.\n\n- Search result [2] from Binance Square on May 18, 2025, discusses a SHORT analysis but isn't relevant to June 5.\n\n- Search result [9] from Coinalyze.net's live chart mentions a Bitcoin price drop forecasted below $100,000, but the timestamp is June 5, 15:00, which is before the candle in question.\n\n- Search result [61] from Forex24.pro's Bitcoin forecast for June 5, 2025, predicts a test of resistance at 107,245 and a potential drop to 99,645. However, this is a forecast, not actual data.\n\n- Search result [63] from CoinMarketCap's BTC/USDT converter as of June 5, 2025, shows a -3.61% change, but this is likely the 24-hour change, not the specific 1-hour candle.\n\nThe key here is that the resolution depends on the 1-hour candle change displayed on Binance's BTC/USDT spot page. The user provided a link to Binance's BTC/USDT spot trading page, which should show the 1H candle data. However, the search results don't include a direct snapshot of that specific candle's percentage change at 20:00-21:00 UTC on June 5.\n\nGiven that the current time is just after the candle closed, and assuming the data is available, the next step is to look for the exact percentage change in the provided sources. Search result [3] and [63] mention a -3.61% change, but that's the 24-hour movement. The 1-hour candle's change isn't explicitly listed in the provided search results. \n\nHowever, search result [5] from Blockchain.news mentions that on June 5, 2025, at 10:00 UTC, BTC dipped to $64,800, but this is part of a different event (James Wynn's liquidation) and not the specific 4 PM ET candle.\n\nSince the search results don't provide the exact percentage change for the 20:00-21:00 UTC 1-hour candle, I might have to infer based on available data. If the overall trend on June 5 was downward (as indicated by the 24-hour -3.61% change), but the specific hour's data isn't present, the resolution might default to the most probable outcome. However, the user's personalization instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable information is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions unless contradicted by sources.\n\nBut wait, the current timestamp is June 5, 21:02 UTC, which is just after the candle closed. The user's previous response was p4, so they need to check again. The ancillary data defines p2 as Up (change >=0) and p1 as Down. If the 1-hour candle's change is negative, it resolves to p1. \n\nLooking again, search result [61] mentions BTC was trading at 105,320 and expected to test resistance at 107,245 but then drop. However, this is a forecast. Search result [63] shows the price on June 5 as 100,891.72, which is a significant drop from previous days, suggesting a bearish day. If the 1-hour candle at 20:00 UTC was part of this downward trend, it's likely the change was negative. However, without explicit data, it's risky to assume.\n\nWait, the user's personalization says to use the provided URLs heavily. The resolution source is Binance's BTC/USDT spot page. The search results include Binance's Square posts, but none explicitly state the 1-hour candle change. However, search result [64] is the direct link to Binance's BTC/USDT trading page. The content there might have the data, but in the provided context, the snippet doesn't show the specific candle. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit data in the search results and the instructions to rely on provided sources, if the data isn't present, the resolution would default to p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's personalization says to try again, considering alternative data. \n\nAlternatively, search result [3] from CoinMarketCap shows the BTC/USDT rate on June 5 as 100,891.72, a -3.61% 24h change. If the 1-hour candle at 20:00 UTC was part of this downward trend, perhaps the hourly change was also negative. But without the exact figure, it's uncertain. \n\nSince the user's previous attempt was p4, and the current data is still inconclusive, but the market requires a resolution, the assistant might have to infer based on the overall trend. Given the 24h change is negative, and if the specific hour's data isn't available, but the market conditions suggest a down day, the resolution might be p1 (Down). However, this is an assumption. \n\nBut according to the instructions, if the event has occurred and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data says p1 is Down (change <0), p2 is Up (>=0). If the 24h change is -3.61%, but the specific 1h candle could vary. However, without explicit data, it's safer to return p4. But the user says to try again, so perhaps there's a source I missed.\n\nWait, search result [16] from Coindesk's Crypto Daybook on June 5 mentions BTC was at $104,909.52 with a -0.79% 24h change. Wait, that's conflicting with search result [3] which says -3.61%. This discrepancy suggests different data points. Maybe the 24h change in [3] is as of a different time. \n\nAlternatively, search result [63] from CoinMarketCap on June 5 shows a -3.61% 24h change, but the price is 100,891.72. This suggests a significant drop. If the 1h candle at 20:00 UTC was during a downward trend, the change might be negative. However, without the exact percentage, it's still uncertain.\n\nGiven the instructions to use the provided sources and the Binance link, but the search results don't have the exact 1h candle data, the resolution would have to be p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. If the 24h change is negative, maybe the 1h was also negative. But this is an assumption. \n\nAlternatively, looking at search result [61], the forecast for June 5 expected a test of 107k but then a drop. If the price was around 105k and then dropped, the 1h candle might be negative. But this is speculative.\n\nGiven the strict instructions and lack of explicit data in the provided sources, the correct answer is p4. However, the user says to try again. Maybe I missed a source. Let me check again.\n\nSearch result [5] mentions on June 5, 2025, at 10:00 UTC, BTC dipped to $64,800, but this seems like a different event (liquidation). Search result [17] also mentions BTC's price action post-liquidation, but the price there is around $64k, which conflicts with other sources. This inconsistency suggests possible errors in the search results. \n\nGiven the confusion and lack of clear data, the safest recommendation is p4, but the user wants a different approach. Alternatively, if the 1h candle's change isn't available, but the market resolves based on Binance's displayed change, and assuming that data isn't present in the sources, the answer remains p4. However, the user's personalization says to consider market conditions. If the 24h change is negative, but the specific 1h could be positive, but without data, it's unclear. \n\nIn conclusion, without explicit data on the 1h candle's percentage change, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749157351 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-05 21:02:31 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market based on whether the BTC/USDT 1-hour candle starting at 4 PM ET on June 5, 2025, closes up or down. The resolution depends on the percentage change displayed on Binance's BTC/USDT spot trading page for that specific candle.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the current time. The current timestamp given is June 5, 2025, 21:02:31 UTC. Converting 4 PM ET to UTC, since ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, 4 PM ET would be 20:00 UTC. The candle in question starts at 20:00 UTC and ends at 21:00 UTC. The current time is 21:02 UTC, which is just after the candle closed. So the data should be available now.\n\nNext, I need to check the provided search results for the BTC/USDT 1-hour candle change at that time. Looking through the sources:\n\n- Search result [3] from CoinMarketCap shows the BTC/USDT rate on June 5 as 100,891.72 USDT with a -3.61% change. However, this might be the daily change, not the 1-hour candle.\n  \n- Search result [16] from Coindesk's Crypto Daybook mentions BTC was at $104,909.52 with a -0.79% change over 24 hours as of June 5, but again, this is daily data.\n\n- Search result [2] from Binance Square on May 18, 2025, discusses a SHORT analysis but isn't relevant to June 5.\n\n- Search result [9] from Coinalyze.net's live chart mentions a Bitcoin price drop forecasted below $100,000, but the timestamp is June 5, 15:00, which is before the candle in question.\n\n- Search result [61] from Forex24.pro's Bitcoin forecast for June 5, 2025, predicts a test of resistance at 107,245 and a potential drop to 99,645. However, this is a forecast, not actual data.\n\n- Search result [63] from CoinMarketCap's BTC/USDT converter as of June 5, 2025, shows a -3.61% change, but this is likely the 24-hour change, not the specific 1-hour candle.\n\nThe key here is that the resolution depends on the 1-hour candle change displayed on Binance's BTC/USDT spot page. The user provided a link to Binance's BTC/USDT spot trading page, which should show the 1H candle data. However, the search results don't include a direct snapshot of that specific candle's percentage change at 20:00-21:00 UTC on June 5.\n\nGiven that the current time is just after the candle closed, and assuming the data is available, the next step is to look for the exact percentage change in the provided sources. Search result [3] and [63] mention a -3.61% change, but that's the 24-hour movement. The 1-hour candle's change isn't explicitly listed in the provided search results. \n\nHowever, search result [5] from Blockchain.news mentions that on June 5, 2025, at 10:00 UTC, BTC dipped to $64,800, but this is part of a different event (James Wynn's liquidation) and not the specific 4 PM ET candle.\n\nSince the search results don't provide the exact percentage change for the 20:00-21:00 UTC 1-hour candle, I might have to infer based on available data. If the overall trend on June 5 was downward (as indicated by the 24-hour -3.61% change), but the specific hour's data isn't present, the resolution might default to the most probable outcome.

But without the exact figure, it's uncertain. \n\nSince the user's previous attempt was p4, and the current data is still inconclusive, but the market requires a resolution, the assistant might have to infer based on the overall trend.

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

The user wants to resolve a market prediction about whether Bitcoin's price (BTC/USDT) will be up or down based on the 1-hour candle starting at 4 PM ET on June 5, 2025. The resolution depends on the percentage change shown on Binance's BTC/USDT spot market for that specific candle.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current time. The given timestamp is June 5, 2025, 21:02:31 UTC. Converting 4 PM ET to UTC, since ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, 4 PM ET would be 8 PM UTC. The candle in question starts at 8 PM UTC and ends at 9 PM UTC. The current time is 9:02 PM UTC, which is just after the candle's closing time. So, the data for that candle should be available now.\n\nNext, I need to look at the provided search results to find the BTC/USDT price data around that time. Let's go through the sources:\n\nSearch result [1] mentions Bitcoin's price as $68,450 at 10:00 AM UTC on June 5, with a 2.3% increase over 24 hours. It also notes that by 12:00 PM UTC, BTC broke above the 50-day moving average of $67,800. However, this is earlier in the day, not the 8 PM candle.\n\nSearch result [2] from CoinMarketCap shows the BTC to USDT rate. On June 5, the closing rate was 100,891.72 USDT, a 3.61% decrease. But this data is taken at 00:00 UTC each day, so it's daily closing, not the 1-hour candle at 8 PM UTC.\n\nSearch result [3] is about BTCUSDT futures on HTX, with the current price at 104,313.7 USDT, up 0.93% in 24 hours as of the time of the data. However, this is futures data, not the spot market specified in the query.\n\nSearch result [4] provides USDT to BTC conversion rates, but again, this is daily closing data, not the specific 1-hour window.\n\nSearch result [6] from Mudrex shows the BTC to USDT rate as 104,562.3 USDT as of June 5, 3:59 PM UTC. This is still before the 8 PM UTC candle.\n\nSearch result [7] includes TradingView ideas mentioning Bitcoin testing $107,500 and consolidation ranges, but the timestamps are unclear and might not align with the specific hour.\n\nSearch result [11] from OKX's BTCUSDT futures shows a price of 105,404.5 USDT, down 0.17% in 24 hours. Again, futures data isn't the resolution source.\n\nSearch result [13] from CoinGecko shows Tether's price stability, which isn't directly relevant here.\n\nSearch result [18] has a price prediction table with June 5, 2025, at $106,213.84, but this is a forecast, not actual data.\n\nSearch result [19] from CoinGecko's historical data for Bitcoin shows the closing price on June 5 as N/A, with June 4 at $104,813. This might not include the latest data.\n\nThe key here is that the resolution must come from Binance's BTC/USDT spot market for the 1-hour candle starting at 4 PM ET (8 PM UTC). The user provided a link to Binance's spot trading page for BTC/USDT. However, the search results don't include real-time data from that exact hour. \n\nGiven that the current time is just after 9 PM UTC, the 8 PM candle has closed. The change percentage for that candle should be available. However, none of the provided search results explicitly state the percentage change for that specific hour. \n\nLooking at the available data, search result [2] shows a 3.61% decrease on June 5, but this is the daily change. The 1-hour candle at 8 PM UTC might have a different change. Since the user's ancillary data specifies that the resolution depends on the 1H candle's change on Binance, and the search results don't provide this exact figure, I might have to infer based on nearby data.\n\nWait, search result [1] mentions that at 12:00 PM UTC, BTC was at $68,450 with a 2.3% increase. Later, it states that by 12:00 PM UTC, the price broke above $67,800. However, this seems inconsistent with other data points, like search result [2] showing a daily close at 100k USDT. There's a discrepancy here, possibly due to different data sources or pairs.\n\nAlternatively, search result [6] from Mudrex, as of 3:59 PM UTC on June 5, shows 1 BTC = 104,562.3 USDT. If we assume that the price at 8 PM UTC was around this range, but without specific data on the 1-hour change, it's challenging. \n\nSince the user's instructions say to resolve based on Binance's data and the specific candle, and the search results don't have the exact percentage change for that hour, but the current time is past the candle's close, the correct approach is to check if any sources mention the price movement during that hour. \n\nHowever, none of the provided search results include the exact 1-hour change for 8 PM UTC. The closest is search result [2], which shows a 3.61% daily decrease, but that's for the entire day, not the specific hour. \n\nGiven the instructions, if no verifiable data is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p1 as Down (change <0), p2 as Up (change >=0). If the data isn't available, but the event date is in the past, and the user insists on a resolution, we might have to default to p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's additional instructions say to try again if previous response was p4, considering market conditions.\n\nLooking at the broader market data: search result [1] mentions a 2.3% increase over 24 hours as of 10 AM UTC, and search result [2] shows a daily decrease of 3.61% by midnight UTC. The 1-hour candle at 8 PM UTC's change isn't clear. If the price was fluctuating during the day, the specific hour's change could be positive or negative. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the current timestamp is June 5, 21:02 UTC, and the candle closed at 9 PM UTC, perhaps the 1-hour change is available in real-time data. But the provided search results don't include this. \n\nSince the user's query requires using Binance's data, and the provided sources don't have the exact figure, but the event time has passed, the correct resolution would be to check if the change is >=0. If no data is available, but the market conditions suggest a probable outcome, we might infer. However, without concrete data, the safest recommendation is p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's additional instructions say to avoid p4 if possible. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nSo, in this case, the event date is in the past (June 5, 4 PM ET), and if no verifiable info is available, we should assume the most probable outcome. But how to determine that? \n\nLooking at the broader data: search result [2] shows that on June 5, the daily close was a 3.61% decrease. However, the 1-hour candle at 8 PM UTC might have a different trend. For example, if the price was rising during that hour despite the overall daily decrease. \n\nAlternatively, search result [18] predicts a 1.19% increase on June 5, but that's a forecast. \n\nWithout explicit data for that hour, but given that the daily trend was downward, it's possible the 1-hour candle was also negative. However, this is an assumption. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the user's query is about the 1-hour candle at 4 PM ET (8 PM UTC), and the current time is just after 9 PM UTC, perhaps the price at 8 PM was lower than at 7 PM, leading to a negative change. But without data, this is speculative.\n\nGiven the instructions, if no data is available, but the event is in the past, we must assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data defines p2 as Up (change >=0). If we can't verify, but have to infer, perhaps the market moved up. However, this is uncertain. \n\nAlternatively, looking at search result [7], which mentions Bitcoin testing $107,500 and consolidation, but the timing is unclear. If that happened around the relevant hour, maybe the change was positive. \n\nThis is getting too speculative. The correct approach, given the lack of explicit data in the provided sources, is to recommend p4 (cannot resolve due to insufficient data). However, the user's additional instructions say to try again and consider market conditions. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\" The user provided the Binance URL, but the search results don't include data from that URL. Therefore, without access to the actual Binance page data, we can't confirm the change. \n\nIn this case, since the required data isn't present in the provided search results, and we can't access the Binance page directly, the resolution can't be definitively determined. However, the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if the event is in the past. \n\nGiven the daily data shows a decrease, but the specific hour could vary, and without concrete information, the safest recommendation is p4. But the user wants to avoid p4. Alternatively, if we consider that the 1-hour candle's change is part of the daily trend, maybe it's negative. But this is an assumption. \n\nAlternatively, looking at search result [2], the 24h change on June 5 was -3.61%, but the 1-hour candle at 8 PM UTC might have a different change. If the price was lower at 8 PM than at 7 PM, the change is negative. But without the exact data, it's unclear. \n\nGiven the instructions, and the requirement to resolve based on Binance's data, which isn't available here, the correct recommendation is p4. However, the user's additional instructions push to avoid p4. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nThe event date is in the past. The user prompt's ancillary data says p2 is Up (change >=0). If we have to assume the most probable outcome, perhaps we look at the broader market movement. \n\nSearch result [1] mentions Bitcoin's price increased by 2.3% over 24 hours as of 10 AM UTC. If that upward trend continued, maybe the 8 PM UTC hour was positive. However, search result [2] shows a daily decrease, suggesting the price dropped later in the day. \n\nThis is conflicting. Without explicit data, it's impossible to know. Therefore, the only compliant answer is p4, but the user wants to avoid that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1-hour candle's change can be inferred from the futures data. Search result [3] shows BTCUSDT futures at 104,313.7 USDT, up 0.93% in 24 hours. If the spot market followed similar trends, maybe the 1-hour change was positive. But futures and spot can differ. \n\nThis is too uncertain. Given the strict instructions, and lack of explicit data, the correct recommendation is p4. However, the user's additional instructions say to try again. \n\nWait, the user's query includes the resolution source as Binance's BTC/USDT spot market. The provided search results don't include the exact 1-hour change for that candle. Therefore, the answer must be p4. But the user's personalization says to avoid p4 if possible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1-hour candle's change is zero or positive. But without data, this is a guess. \n\nGiven the instructions, the correct answer is p4, but the user's additional instructions push to find another way. However, without data, it's impossible. Therefore, despite the user's request, the recommendation must be p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749157351 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-05 21:02:31 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4.

The user wants to resolve a market prediction about whether Bitcoin's price (BTC/USDT) will be up or down based on the 1-hour candle starting at 4 PM ET on June 5, 2025. The resolution depends on the percentage change shown on Binance's BTC/USDT spot market for that specific candle.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current time. The given timestamp is June 5, 2025, 21:02:31 UTC. Converting 4 PM ET to UTC, since ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, 4 PM ET would be 8 PM UTC. The candle in question starts at 8 PM UTC and ends at 9 PM UTC. The current time is 9:02 PM UTC, which is just after the candle's closing time. So, the data for that candle should be available now.\n\nNext, I need to look at the provided search results to find the BTC/USDT price data around that time. Let's go through the sources:\n\nSearch result [1] mentions Bitcoin's price as $68,450 at 10:00 AM UTC on June 5, with a 2.3% increase over 24 hours. It also notes that by 12:00 PM UTC, BTC broke above the 50-day moving average of $67,800. However, this is earlier in the day, not the 8 PM candle.\n\nSearch result [2] from CoinMarketCap shows the BTC to USDT rate. On June 5, the closing rate was 100,891.72 USDT, a 3.61% decrease. But this data is taken at 00:00 UTC each day, so it's daily closing, not the 1-hour candle at 8 PM UTC.\n\nSearch result [3] is about BTCUSDT futures on HTX, with the current price at 104,313.7 USDT, up 0.93% in 24 hours as of the time of the data. However, this is futures data, not the spot market specified in the query.\n\nSearch result [4] provides USDT to BTC conversion rates, but again, this is daily closing data, not the specific 1-hour window.\n\nSearch result [6] from Mudrex shows the BTC to USDT rate as 104,562.3 USDT as of June 5, 3:59 PM UTC. This is still before the 8 PM UTC candle.\n\nSearch result [7] includes TradingView ideas mentioning Bitcoin testing $107,500 and consolidation ranges, but the timestamps are unclear and might not align with the specific hour.\n\nSearch result [11] from OKX's BTCUSDT futures shows a price of 105,404.5 USDT, down 0.17% in 24 hours. Again, futures data isn't the resolution source.\n\nSearch result [13] from CoinGecko shows Tether's price stability, which isn't directly relevant here.\n\nSearch result [18] has a price prediction table with June 5, 2025, at $106,213.84, but this is a forecast, not actual data.\n\nSearch result [19] from CoinGecko's historical data for Bitcoin shows the closing price on June 5 as N/A, with June 4 at $104,813. This might not include the latest data.\n\nThe key here is that the resolution must come from Binance's BTC/USDT spot market for the 1-hour candle starting at 4 PM ET (8 PM UTC). The user provided a link to Binance's spot trading page for BTC/USDT. However, the search results don't include real-time data from that exact hour. \n\nGiven that the current time is just after 9 PM UTC, the 8 PM candle has closed. The change percentage for that candle should be available. However, none of the provided search results explicitly state the percentage change for that specific hour. \n\nLooking at the available data, search result [2] shows a 3.61% decrease on June 5, but this is the daily change. The 1-hour candle at 8 PM UTC might have a different change. Since the user's ancillary data specifies that the resolution depends on the 1H candle's change on Binance, and the search results don't provide this exact figure, I might have to infer based on nearby data.\n\nWait, search result [1] mentions that at 12:00 PM UTC, BTC was at $68,450 with a 2.3% increase. Later, it states that by 12:00 PM UTC, the price broke above $67,800. However, this seems inconsistent with other data points, like search result [2] showing a daily close at 100k USDT. There's a discrepancy here, possibly due to different data sources or pairs.\n\nAlternatively, search result [6] from Mudrex, as of 3:59 PM UTC on June 5, shows 1 BTC = 104,562.3 USDT. If we assume that the price at 8 PM UTC was around this range, but without specific data on the 1-hour change, it's challenging. \n\nSince the user's instructions say to resolve based on Binance's data and the specific candle, and the search results don't have the exact percentage change for that hour, but the current time is past the candle's close, the correct approach is to check if any sources mention the price movement during that hour. \n\nHowever, none of the provided search results include the exact 1-hour change for 8 PM UTC. The closest is search result [2], which shows a 3.61% daily decrease, but that's for the entire day, not the specific hour. \n\nGiven the instructions, if no verifiable data is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p1 as Down (change <0), p2 as Up (change >=0). If the data isn't available, but the event date is in the past, and the user insists on a resolution, we might have to default to p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's additional instructions say to try again if previous response was p4, considering market conditions.\n\nLooking at the broader market data: search result [1] mentions a 2.3% increase over 24 hours as of 10 AM UTC, and search result [2] shows a daily decrease of 3.61% by midnight UTC. The 1-hour candle at 8 PM UTC's change isn't clear. If the price was fluctuating during the day, the specific hour's change could be positive or negative. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the current timestamp is June 5, 21:02 UTC, and the candle closed at 9 PM UTC, perhaps the 1-hour change is available in real-time data. But the provided search results don't include this. \n\nSince the user's query requires using Binance's data, and the provided sources don't have the exact figure, but the event time has passed, the correct resolution would be to check if the change is >=0. If no data is available, but the market conditions suggest a probable outcome, we might infer. However, without concrete data, the safest recommendation is p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's additional instructions say to avoid p4 if possible. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nSo, in this case, the event date is in the past (June 5, 4 PM ET), and if no verifiable info is available, we should assume the most probable outcome. But how to determine that? \n\nLooking at the broader data: search result [2] shows that on June 5, the daily close was a 3.61% decrease. However, the 1-hour candle at 8 PM UTC might have a different trend. For example, if the price was rising during that hour despite the overall daily decrease. \n\nAlternatively, search result [18] predicts a 1.19% increase on June 5, but that's a forecast. \n\nWithout explicit data for that hour, but given that the daily trend was downward, it's possible the 1-hour candle was also negative. However, this is an assumption. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the user's query is about the 1-hour candle at 4 PM ET (8 PM UTC), and the current time is just after 9 PM UTC, perhaps the price at 8 PM was lower than at 7 PM, leading to a negative change. But without data, this is speculative.\n\nGiven the instructions, if no data is available, but the event is in the past, we must assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data defines p2 as Up (change >=0). If we can't verify, but have to infer, perhaps the market moved up. However, this is uncertain. \n\nAlternatively, looking at search result [7], which mentions Bitcoin testing $107,500 and consolidation, but the timing is unclear. If that happened around the relevant hour, maybe the change was positive. \n\nThis is getting too speculative. The correct approach, given the lack of explicit data in the provided sources, is to recommend p4 (cannot resolve due to insufficient data). However, the user's additional instructions say to try again and consider market conditions. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\" The user provided the Binance URL, but the search results don't include data from that URL. Therefore, without access to the actual Binance page data, we can't confirm the change. \n\nIn this case, since the required data isn't present in the provided search results, and we can't access the Binance page directly, the resolution can't be definitively determined. However, the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if the event is in the past. \n\nGiven the daily data shows a decrease, but the specific hour could vary, and without concrete information, the safest recommendation is p4. But the user wants to avoid p4. Alternatively, if we consider that the 1-hour candle's change is part of the daily trend, maybe it's negative. But this is an assumption. \n\nAlternatively, looking at search result [2], the 24h change on June 5 was -3.61%, but the 1-hour candle at 8 PM UTC might have a different change. If the price was lower at 8 PM than at 7 PM, the change is negative. But without the exact data, it's unclear. \n\nGiven the instructions, and the requirement to resolve based on Binance's data, which isn't available here, the correct recommendation is p4. However, the user's additional instructions push to avoid p4. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nThe event date is in the past. The user prompt's ancillary data says p2 is Up (change >=0). If we have to assume the most probable outcome, perhaps we look at the broader market movement. \n\nSearch result [1] mentions Bitcoin's price increased by 2.3% over 24 hours as of 10 AM UTC. If that upward trend continued, maybe the 8 PM UTC hour was positive. However, search result [2] shows a daily decrease, suggesting the price dropped later in the day. \n\nThis is conflicting. Without explicit data, it's impossible to know. Therefore, the only compliant answer is p4, but the user wants to avoid that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1-hour candle's change can be inferred from the futures data. Search result [3] shows BTCUSDT futures at 104,313.7 USDT, up 0.93% in 24 hours. If the spot market followed similar trends, maybe the 1-hour change was positive. But futures and spot can differ. \n\nThis is too uncertain. Given the strict instructions, and lack of explicit data, the correct recommendation is p4. However, the user's additional instructions say to try again. \n\nWait, the user's query includes the resolution source as Binance's BTC/USDT spot market. The provided search results don't include the exact 1-hour change for that candle. Therefore, the answer must be p4. But the user's personalization says to avoid p4 if possible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1-hour candle's change is zero or positive. But without data, this is a guess. \n\nGiven the instructions, the correct answer is p4, but the user's additional instructions push to find another way. However, without data, it's impossible. Therefore, despite the user's request, the recommendation must be p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.0005, ID: 5630340021574617120786037469692981094847561746184978150775141772765505777932, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.9995, ID: 32375605415298455623583002361782785782322733970569541434097936513032432000930, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Best for:\n  * Historical data and events\n  * General knowledge questions requiring context\n  * Questions needing interpretation of complex information\n  * Has knowledge cutoff and may not have very recent information\n\n- code_runner: Executes code to fetch real-time data from specific APIs. Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Available Crypto Data Sources:\n    - Binance: Provides cryptocurrency price data for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies\n  * Available Sports Data Sources:\n    - Sports Data IO - MLB (baseball): MLB baseball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NBA (basketball): NBA basketball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NFL (football): NFL football scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NHL (hockey): NHL hockey scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - CFB (college football): College Football (NCAA) scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - CBB (college basketball): College Basketball (NCAA) scores, statistics, and game data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Bitcoin Up or Down - June 5, 4 PM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for BTC/USDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the June 5 2025 1 hour candle that begins at 4PM ET. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTC/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT?type=spot). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTC/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 549440\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\"), college football (e.g., \"What was the score of the Alabama game last Saturday?\"), college basketball (e.g., \"What was Duke's score in their last game?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",

However, the solver ultimately recommends p4 due to the absence of explicit data for the specific 1-hour candle on Binance. This decision, while cautious, overlooks the strong market sentiment which heavily favors a 'Down' outcome (p1). The market data from Polymarket shows a price of 0.9995 for 'Down', indicating nearly 100% confidence in this outcome. This strong market sentiment should have guided the solver towards a p1 recommendation, aligning with the market's view rather than defaulting to p4 due to data uncertainty.",

        "critique": "The response from the solver is thorough and demonstrates a diligent attempt to analyze the available data. However, it ultimately concludes with a recommendation of p4 (cannot resolve), which is inconsistent with the strong market sentiment favoring a 'Down' outcome (p1). The solver's analysis is based on the absence of specific data for the 1-hour candle from Binance, which is necessary for a definitive resolution. Despite the detailed analysis, the solver fails to align with the market data, which shows a strong preference for 'Down' with a confidence of 99.95%. This discrepancy indicates a significant misalignment with market expectations and suggests a need for a default to p4 due to this contradiction.",
