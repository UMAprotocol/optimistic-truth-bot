Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\"), college football (e.g., \"What was the score of the Alabama game last Saturday?\"), college basketball (e.g., \"What was Duke's score in their last game?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Dodgers vs. Mets, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for May 25 at 7:00PM ET:\nIf the Los Angeles Dodgers win, the market will resolve to \"Dodgers\".\nIf the New York Mets win, the market will resolve to \"Mets\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\nTo know when a postponed game will be played, please check the home team's schedule on MLB.com for the listed team and look for the game described as a makeup game.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Mets, p2 to Dodgers, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1748224019 Current Date and Time: 2025-05-26 01:46:59 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\n# Load environment variables\nload_dotenv()\nMLB_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\nif not MLB_API_KEY:\n    raise ValueError(\"Missing SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\n\n# API configuration\nHEADERS = {\"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key\": MLB_API_KEY}\nPRIMARY_ENDPOINT = \"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json\"\nPROXY_ENDPOINT = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/mlb-proxy\"\n\n# Resolution map\nRESOLUTION_MAP = {\n    \"Dodgers\": \"p2\",\n    \"Mets\": \"p1\",\n    \"50-50\": \"p3\",\n    \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\"\n}\n\ndef get_data(url, proxy=False):\n    headers = {\"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key\": MLB_API_KEY}\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        return response.json()\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        if proxy:\n            print(f\"Error with primary endpoint, trying proxy.

Where p1 corresponds to Mets, p2 to Dodgers, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Mets, p2 = Dodgers\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Mets outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.935 = 93.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Where p1 corresponds to Mets, p2 to Dodgers, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1748224019 Current Date and Time: 2025-05-26 01:46:59 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\n# Load environment variables\nload_dotenv()\nAPI_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\nif not API_KEY:\n    raise ValueError(\"Missing SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\n\n# API configuration\nHEADERS = {\"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key\": API_KEY}\nPRIMARY_ENDPOINT = \"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json\"\nPROXY_ENDPOINT = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\"\n\n# Game details\nGAME_DATE = \"2025-05-25\"\nHOME_TEAM = \"Mets\"\nAWAY_TEAM = \"Dodgers\"\n\n# Resolution map\nRESOLUTION_MAP = {\n    \"Mets\": \"p1\",\n    \"Dodgers\": \"p2\",\n    \"50-50\": \"p3\",\n    \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\"\n}\n\ndef get_data(url, headers):\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        return response.json()\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error fetching data: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef find_game(games, home_team, away_team):\n    for game in games:\n        if game['HomeTeam'] == home_team and game['AwayTeam'] == away_team:\n            return game\n    return None\n\ndef resolve_market(game):\n    if not game:\n        return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"Too early to resolve\"]\n    if game['Status'] == 'Final':\n        if game['HomeTeamRuns'] > game['AwayTeamRuns']:\n            return RESOLUTION_MAP[game['HomeTeam']]\n        elif game['AwayTeamRuns'] > game['HomeTeamRuns']:\n            return RESOLUTION_MAP[game['AwayTeam']]\n    elif game['Status'] in ['Canceled', 'Postponed']:\n        return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"50-50\"]\n    return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"Too early to resolve\"]\n\ndef main():\n    # Construct URL for the game date\n    url = f\"{PRIMARY_ENDPOINT}/GamesByDate/{GAME_DATE}\"\n    games = get_data(url, HEADERS)\n    if not games:\n        # Fallback to proxy if primary fails\n        games = get_data(PROXY_ENDPOINT, HEADERS)\n    \n    if games:\n        game = find_game(games, HOME_TEAM, AWAY_TEAM)\n        result = resolve_market(game)\n        print(f\"recommendation: {result}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"recommendation:\", RESOLUTION_MAP[\"Too early to resolve\"])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nError fetching data: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json/GamesByDate/2025-05-25\nError fetching data: 400 Client Error: Bad Request for url: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\nrecommendation: p4\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Where p1 corresponds to Mets, p2 to Dodgers, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Mets, p2 = Dodgers\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Mets outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.935 = 93.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "system_prompt_after": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.).

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Dodgers vs. Mets, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for May 25 at 7:00PM ET:\nIf the Los Angeles Dodgers win, the market will resolve to \"Dodgers\".\nIf the New York Mets win, the market will resolve to \"Mets\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\nTo know when a postponed game will be played, please check the home team's schedule on MLB.com for the listed team and look for the game described as a makeup game.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Mets, p2 to Dodgers, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1748224019 Current Date and Time: 2025-05-26 01:46:59 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Consider using a different API or data source that does not require authorization or is more reliable.

Where p1 corresponds to Mets, p2 to Dodgers, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Mets, p2 = Dodgers\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Mets outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.935 = 93.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Dodgers vs. Mets game on May 25, 2025. The current date is May 26, 2025, so the game should have already happened. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game was played, postponed, or canceled. Looking at the search results, there's a mention of a game on May 25 between the Dodgers and Mets. However, some sources like [5] mention a postponement on May 27, 2024, but that's a different year. The key here is the 2025 season. \n\nSearch result [5] from the Mets Insider Blog states that a game was postponed on May 27, 2024, but that's not relevant here. The user's query is about May 25, 2025. Other results like [1], [2], [4], [12], [17], [23], [26], [28], [34], [42], [47], [62] discuss the May 23 and May 24 games, with the May 23 game going into 13 innings and the May 24 game being a Mets win. \n\nFor the May 25 game, search results [2], [10], [30], [43], [44], [54], [57] provide some details. Specifically, [2] and [43] mention the starting pitchers as Landon Knack for the Dodgers and Kodai Senga for the Mets. However, the actual outcome of the May 25 game isn't clearly stated in the provided search results. Some sources like [21] mention Shohei Ohtani hitting a home run on May 25, which would be part of the game. \n\nWait, result [21] from Spectrum Local News says Ohtani hit a home run on May 25 off Kodai Senga. That indicates the game was played. Additionally, [24] and [39] from Dodgers Digest preview the May 25 game, and [25], [33], [51], [59] from Covers.com and CBS Sports predict the game, but the actual result isn't explicitly stated in the search results. \n\nHowever, looking at [55] (ESPN's live score for May 25), the Mets are listed as 18-7 and the Dodgers as 16-9, but the live score doesn't show the final result. Other sources like [10], [30], [43] mention specific plays but don't confirm the final score. \n\nGiven that the user's current timestamp is May 26, 2025, and the game was scheduled for May 25, if there's no explicit mention of postponement or cancellation, and there are references to the game being played (like Ohtani's home run in [21]), it's safe to assume the game occurred. \n\nNow, determining the winner. The search results don't have a direct box score for May 25. However, [21] mentions Ohtani hitting a home run, and [24] and [39] discuss the starting pitchers. If the game wasn't postponed, and based on the ancillary data, we need to check who won. \n\nWait, result [55] (ESPN) shows the Mets at 18-7 and Dodgers at 16-9, which might be post-May 25 game. If the Mets' record improved from 31-21 to 18-7 (wait, that doesn't make sense\u201431-21 is a different season's record). Maybe the records in [55] are from a different context. This is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, looking at [25], [33], [51], [59], the predictions favor the Mets due to pitching matchup. But predictions don't determine the outcome. \n\nSince the search results don't explicitly state the outcome of the May 25 game, but there's evidence the game was played (Ohtani's HR in [21]), and the user's personalization instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if no verifiable info is available. However, the user also says to check if the event is in the past and use verifiable sources. \n\nWait, the user provided search results up to [63], but many are duplicates. Let me check again. \n\nResult [21] clearly states: \"About 4 1/2 hours after Ohtani finished up on the mound, he drove Kodai Senga's second pitch 411 feet into the second deck in right field for his 18th home run of the season.\" This indicates the game was played on May 25, and Ohtani played, hitting a HR. However, the final score isn't mentioned here. \n\nResult [24] and [39] from Dodgers Digest mention the May 25 game preview, but no result. Result [55] (ESPN) shows the Mets at 18-7 and Dodgers at 16-9, but without a clear date reference. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit final score in the provided search results, but the game was played (no mention of postponement), and the user instructions say to resolve based on the most probable outcome if no info is available. However, the ancillary data says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nBut wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nSince the game date is May 25, 2025, and the current timestamp is May 26, 2025, the event is in the past. If no verifiable outcome is found, we have to infer. However, the search results do mention parts of the game (Ohtani's HR), so it was played. But without the final score, how to determine the winner?\n\nLooking at the betting predictions in [25], [33], [51], [59], the Mets were favored, but that's not conclusive. However, the user instructions say to rely on the provided search results. Since there's no explicit final score, but the game was played, perhaps the resolution should be p4 (cannot resolve), but the user says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nBut in this case, there is some information\u2014Ohtani hit a HR, the game was played. But without the final score, we can't confirm who won. However, the user might expect the assistant to infer from available data. For example, in [21], Ohtani's HR is mentioned, but that's just one play. The Mets might have won if Senga pitched well, as per the previews. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game was postponed. Wait, result [5] mentions a postponement on May 27, 2024, but that's a different year. There's no mention of May 25, 2025, being postponed. \n\nGiven the conflicting information and lack of explicit outcome, but the game was played, the resolution would depend on the actual result. Since the search results don't provide the final score, but the user requires a resolution, the correct approach is to check if any sources mention the outcome. \n\nWait, looking at [55] (ESPN's live score for May 25), the Mets are listed as 18-7 and Dodgers 16-9. If that's after the game, the Mets would have won, improving their record. However, without explicit confirmation, this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, result [30] (FOX Sports box score) shows the Mets leading 3-1 in the 9th inning, but it's a live score, not final. Similarly, [43] and [57] show the Mets leading 3-1, but again, not final. \n\nGiven the uncertainty and the requirement to resolve based on provided sources, and the lack of explicit final score, but the game was played, the resolution should be p4 (cannot resolve at this time). However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nBut the user also says: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\" The user didn't provide URLs, so we rely on the search results given. \n\nSince the search results don't have the final score for May 25, but the game was played, and the user requires a resolution, the assistant must infer. However, without clear data, the safest recommendation is p4. But the user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThe ancillary data defines p2 as Dodgers win, p1 as Mets win. The most probable outcome based on the previews and pitching matchup (Senga vs. Knack) would be Mets, but without confirmation, it's risky. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game was postponed. But there's no evidence of that in the search results for May 25, 2025. The only postponement mentioned is in [5] for 2024. \n\nGiven the conflicting info and lack of explicit result, but the game was played (Ohtani's HR), the assistant should recommend p4. However, the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThis is a tough call. Since the user's personalization emphasizes relying on provided sources and the current timestamp is after the game date, but the sources don't confirm the outcome, the correct recommendation is p4. However, if the game was played and the outcome isn't found, perhaps the resolution is p3 (50-50). Wait, the ancillary data says p3 is for canceled games. The user's resolution_conditions say p3 is 0.5 for canceled games. \n\nSince the game was played (based on Ohtani's HR), it's not canceled. Therefore, if no outcome is found, but the game was played, the resolution should be based on the most probable outcome. However, the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if no info. \n\nGiven that the Mets were favored in the previews and Senga had a better ERA, the probable outcome is Mets win (p1). But without explicit confirmation, this is an assumption. \n\nAlternatively, if the game was played and the outcome isn't in the sources, the resolution should be p4. However, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nSince the event date is in the past, and no sources explicitly contradict, the resolution would be the most probable outcome. The conditions in the user prompt's ancillary data don't specify what's probable, but the betting previews suggest Mets. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p1 (Mets win). But I need to be careful here. The user's instructions are strict about relying on sources. If the sources don't mention the outcome, even if the game was played, the assistant should resolve as p4. However, the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome if the event is in the past and no info. \n\nThis is conflicting. The key is whether the game was played. Since Ohtani's HR is mentioned in [21], the game was played. Therefore, it's not postponed or canceled. The lack of final score in the provided sources means the assistant has to infer. \n\nIn this case, the correct approach is to recommend p4 because the outcome isn't verifiable from the provided sources. However, the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the user's directive to assume the most probable outcome when the event is in the past and no info, and considering the Mets were favored, the recommendation would be p1. However, this is a risk. \n\nAlternatively, if the game was played but the result isn't found, perhaps it's a draw or unresolved, but MLB games can't end in a tie. Therefore, the game must have a winner. Since the sources don't provide it, but the user requires a resolution, the assistant must default to p4. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nThe ancillary data says p1 is Mets, p2 is Dodgers. The most probable outcome would depend on the conditions. If the user's ancillary data doesn't specify probabilities, but the market resolves based on who wins, and the sources don't confirm, the assistant must go with p4. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome. Since the game was played, and no result is found, but the user requires a resolution, the assistant has to make a call. \n\nGiven the conflict, the safest recommendation is p4, indicating insufficient information. However, the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThis is a tricky situation. Based on the provided search results, there's no explicit final score for May 25. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1748224019 Current Date and Time: 2025-05-26 01:46:59 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Dodgers vs. Mets game on May 25, 2025. The current date is May 26, 2025, so the game should have already happened. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game was played, postponed, or canceled. Looking at the search results, there's a mention of a game on May 25 between the Dodgers and Mets. However, some sources like [5] mention a postponement on May 27, 2024, but that's a different year. The key here is the 2025 season. \n\nSearch result [5] from the Mets Insider Blog states that a game was postponed on May 27, 2024, but that's not relevant here. The user's query is about May 25, 2025. Other results like [1], [2], [4], [12], [17], [23], [26], [28], [34], [42], [47], [62] discuss the May 23 and May 24 games, with the May 23 game going into 13 innings and the May 24 game being a Mets win. \n\nFor the May 25 game, search results [2], [10], [30], [43], [44], [54], [57] provide some details. Specifically, [2] and [43] mention the starting pitchers as Landon Knack for the Dodgers and Kodai Senga for the Mets. However, the actual outcome of the May 25 game isn't clearly stated in the provided search results. Some sources like [21] mention Shohei Ohtani hitting a home run on May 25, which would be part of the game. \n\nWait, result [21] from Spectrum Local News says Ohtani hit a home run on May 25 off Kodai Senga. That indicates the game was played. Additionally, [24] and [39] from Dodgers Digest preview the May 25 game, and [25], [33], [51], [59] from Covers.com and CBS Sports predict the game, but the actual result isn't explicitly stated in the search results. \n\nHowever, looking at [55] (ESPN's live score for May 25), the Mets are listed as 18-7 and the Dodgers as 16-9, but the live score doesn't show the final result. Other sources like [10], [30], [43] mention specific plays but don't confirm the final score. \n\nGiven that the user's current timestamp is May 26, 2025, and the game was scheduled for May 25, if there's no explicit mention of postponement or cancellation, and there are references to the game being played (like Ohtani's home run in [21]), it's safe to assume the game occurred. \n\nNow, determining the winner. The search results don't have a direct box score for May 25. However, [21] mentions Ohtani hitting a home run, and [24] and [39] discuss the starting pitchers. If the game wasn't postponed, and based on the ancillary data, we need to check who won. \n\nWait, result [55] (ESPN) shows the Mets at 18-7 and Dodgers at 16-9, which might be post-May 25 game. If the Mets' record improved from 31-21 to 18-7 (wait, that doesn't make sense\u201431-21 is a different season's record). Maybe the records in [55] are from a different context. This is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, looking at [25], [33], [51], [59], the predictions favor the Mets due to pitching matchup. But predictions don't determine the outcome. \n\nSince the search results don't explicitly state the outcome of the May 25 game, but there's evidence the game was played (Ohtani's HR in [21]), and the user's personalization instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if no verifiable info is available. However, the user also says to check if the event is in the past and use verifiable sources. \n\nWait, the user provided search results up to [63], but many are duplicates. Let me check again. \n\nResult [21] clearly states: \"About 4 1/2 hours after Ohtani finished up on the mound, he drove Kodai Senga's second pitch 411 feet into the second deck in right field for his 18th home run of the season.\" This indicates the game was played on May 25, and Ohtani played, hitting a HR. However, the final score isn't mentioned here. \n\nResult [24] and [39] from Dodgers Digest mention the May 25 game preview, but no result. Result [55] (ESPN) shows the Mets at 18-7 and Dodgers at 16-9, but without a clear date reference. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit final score in the provided search results, but the game was played (no mention of postponement), and the user instructions say to resolve based on the most probable outcome if no info is available. However, the ancillary data says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nBut wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nSince the game date is May 25, 2025, and the current timestamp is May 26, 2025, the event is in the past. If no verifiable outcome is found, we have to infer. However, the search results do mention parts of the game (Ohtani's HR), so it was played. But without the final score, how to determine the winner?\n\nLooking at the betting predictions in [25], [33], [51], [59], the Mets were favored, but that's not conclusive. However, the user instructions say to rely on the provided search results. Since there's no explicit final score, but the game was played, perhaps the resolution should be p4 (cannot resolve), but the user says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nBut in this case, there is some information\u2014Ohtani hit a HR, the game was played. But without the final score, we can't confirm who won. However, the user might expect the assistant to infer from available data. For example, in [21], Ohtani's HR is mentioned, but that's just one play. The Mets might have won if Senga pitched well, as per the previews. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game was postponed. Wait, result [5] mentions a postponement on May 27, 2024, but that's a different year. There's no mention of May 25, 2025, being postponed. \n\nGiven the conflicting information and lack of explicit outcome, but the game was played, the resolution would depend on the actual result. Since the search results don't provide the final score, but the user requires a resolution, the correct approach is to check if any sources mention the outcome. \n\nWait, looking at [55] (ESPN's live score for May 25), the Mets are listed as 18-7 and Dodgers 16-9. If that's after the game, the Mets would have won, improving their record. However, without explicit confirmation, this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, result [30] (FOX Sports box score) shows the Mets leading 3-1 in the 9th inning, but it's a live score, not final. Similarly, [43] and [57] show the Mets leading 3-1, but again, not final. \n\nGiven the uncertainty and the requirement to resolve based on provided sources, and the lack of explicit final score, but the game was played, the resolution should be p4 (cannot resolve at this time). However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nBut the user also says: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\" The user didn't provide URLs, so we rely on the search results given. \n\nSince the search results don't have the final score for May 25, but the game was played, and the user requires a resolution, the assistant must infer. However, without clear data, the safest recommendation is p4. But the user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThe ancillary data defines p2 as Dodgers win, p1 as Mets win. The most probable outcome based on the previews and pitching matchup (Senga vs. Knack) would be Mets, but without confirmation, it's risky. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game was postponed. But there's no evidence of that in the search results for May 25, 2025. The only postponement mentioned is in [5] for 2024. \n\nGiven the conflicting info and lack of explicit result, but the game was played (Ohtani's HR), the assistant should recommend p4. However, the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThis is a tough call. Since the user's personalization emphasizes relying on provided sources and the current timestamp is after the game date, but the sources don't confirm the outcome, the correct recommendation is p4. However, if the game was played and the outcome isn't found, perhaps the resolution is p3 (50-50). Wait, the ancillary data says p3 is for canceled games. The user's resolution_conditions say p3 is 0.5 for canceled games. \n\nSince the game was played (based on Ohtani's HR), it's not canceled. Therefore, if no outcome is found, but the game was played, the resolution should be based on the most probable outcome. However, the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if no info. \n\nGiven that the Mets were favored in the previews and Senga had a better ERA, the probable outcome is Mets win (p1). But without explicit confirmation, this is an assumption. \n\nAlternatively, if the game was played and the outcome isn't in the sources, the resolution should be p4. However, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nSince the event date is in the past, and no sources explicitly contradict, the resolution would be the most probable outcome. The conditions in the user prompt's ancillary data don't specify what's probable, but the betting previews suggest Mets. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p1 (Mets win). But I need to be careful here. The user's instructions are strict about relying on sources. If the sources don't mention the outcome, even if the game was played, the assistant should resolve as p4. However, the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome if the event is in the past and no info. \n\nThis is conflicting. The key is whether the game was played.

However, this is a risk. \n\nAlternatively, if the game was played but the result isn't found, perhaps it's a draw or unresolved, but MLB games can't end in a tie. Therefore, the game must have a winner. Since the sources don't provide it, but the user requires a resolution, the assistant must default to p4. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nThe ancillary data says p1 is Mets, p2 is Dodgers. The most probable outcome would depend on the conditions. If the user's ancillary data doesn't specify probabilities, but the market resolves based on who wins, and the sources don't confirm, the assistant must go with p4. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome.

However, the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThis is a tricky situation. Based on the provided search results, there's no explicit final score for May 25. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Dodgers, Price: 0.065, ID: 88976786010264908888748140481916936363845735037403535515486235993687523676942, Winner: No\n- Token: Mets, Price: 0.935, ID: 95868595715782985026852436040568219982872226955751139764904619595490665144242, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Dodgers vs. Mets game on May 25, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for Mets, p2 for Dodgers, and p3 if the game is canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened on May 25. The current date given is May 26, 2025, so the game should have already taken place. Looking at the search results, there are multiple sources mentioning the game on May 25. For example, result [2] from Fox Sports has the date as May 25, 2025, and the box score shows the Mets leading 3-1. Result [27] also from Fox Sports lists the final score as Dodgers 1, Mets 3. Additionally, result [58] from Fingerlakes1.com states the Mets evened the series with a 5-2 win on Saturday, which would be May 24, and mentions the next game is Sunday, May 25. However, the detailed box scores and recaps like [42] and [65] from CBS Sports and AP confirm the Mets won 5-2 on May 24, and the May 25 game is the rubber match. Wait, there's some confusion here. Let me cross-reference.\n\nLooking at result [14] from CBS Sports, the article from May 25 talks about the upcoming game on Sunday night (May 25) between Kodai Senga and Landon Knack. Result [24] from CBS Sports on May 25 also previews the May 25 game. However, result [42] from CBS Sports on May 25 recaps the May 24 game where the Mets won 5-2. The May 25 game is the third in the series. \n\nWait, the user's query is about the game on May 25. The search results include a box score from Fox Sports [2] dated May 25, showing the Mets won 3-1. Result [27] also from Fox Sports on May 25 shows the final score as Dodgers 1, Mets 3. Additionally, result [60] from Fox Sports on May 25 lists the same score. There's also a YouTube video [26] titled \"MLB Highlights - Dodgers vs Mets Recap May 25, 2025\" which mentions a Dodgers 6-4 victory, but that seems conflicting. Wait, that might be a different year or a mistake. Let me check the dates again.\n\nWait, the YouTube video [26] is from May 25, 2025, and describes a Dodgers 6-4 win. However, other sources like the Fox Sports box scores [2], [27], [60] all show the Mets winning 3-1. There's a discrepancy here. Need to verify which is accurate. The AP article in result [42] from May 25 recaps the May 24 game (Mets 5-2) and mentions the May 25 game as the next one. The Fox Sports box scores for May 25 show the Mets winning 3-1. However, the YouTube video [26] might be incorrect or from a different season. Given that multiple reputable sources like CBS Sports and Fox Sports have the Mets winning 3-1 on May 25, I should rely on those. The conflicting YouTube video might be a misdated upload or an error. \n\nAdditionally, result [58] from Fingerlakes1.com on May 25 mentions the Mets winning 5-2 on Saturday (May 24) and the next game being Sunday (May 25) with Senga vs. Knack. The box scores for May 25 indicate the Mets won 3-1. Therefore, the correct outcome for the May 25 game is a Mets victory. Thus, the market should resolve to p1 (Mets). However, I need to ensure there's no postponement or cancellation. All sources indicate the game was played as scheduled on May 25, so no need for p3. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Where p1 corresponds to Mets, p2 to Dodgers, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1748224019 Current Date and Time: 2025-05-26 01:46:59 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query.

If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1.

Where p1 corresponds to Mets, p2 to Dodgers, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\"), college football (e.g., \"What was the score of the Alabama game last Saturday?\"), college basketball (e.g., \"What was Duke's score in their last game?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",
