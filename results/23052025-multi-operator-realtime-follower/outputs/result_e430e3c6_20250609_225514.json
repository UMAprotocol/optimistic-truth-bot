The user wants to know if Donald Trump mentioned \"Trump Derangement Syndrome\" (TDS) between May 24, 12:00 PM ET and May 30, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The resolution depends on verbal mentions in recorded audio or video that's publicly accessible. Written statements or social media posts don't count.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mentions by Trump of TDS within that timeframe. The current date given is June 9, 2025, so the event in question has already occurred.\n\nLooking through the search results, there are a few key sources. Search result [3] from CBS News on June 5, 2025, mentions Trump's comments about Elon Musk having \"Trump derangement syndrome\" during a meeting with the German Chancellor. The exact quote is: \"I don't know what it is. It's sort of Trump derangement syndrome, I guess they call it.\" This is a verbal mention during a public event, which was recorded and reported by CBS News. The date is within the specified timeframe (May 24 to May 30), so this would count.\n\nAnother mention is in search result [14] from Fox News on June 6, 2025, where Trump suggested Musk might have TDS. However, the exact date of the event is June 5, which is within the window. The transcript from the Oval Office meeting on June 5, 2025, confirms this.\n\nAdditionally, search result [16] from Inside Edition on June 5, 2025, reports Trump stating that Musk has \"Trump Derangement Syndrome.\" This is another verbal mention within the timeframe.\n\nThere's also a video source [7] from KTLA 5 News on June 5, 2025, where Trump mentions TDS in relation to Musk. The transcript includes his statement during the meeting with the German Chancellor.\n\nAll these instances are within the May 24 to May 30 window and are verbal mentions in recorded media. There are no conflicting reports indicating that Trump did not make these statements during that period. Therefore, based on the provided sources, Trump did mention \"Trump Derangement Syndrome\" within the specified timeframe.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749509442 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-09 22:50:42 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump mentioned \"Trump Derangement Syndrome\" (TDS) between May 24, 12:00 PM ET and May 30, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The resolution depends on verbal mentions in recorded audio or video that's publicly accessible. Written statements or social media posts don't count.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mentions by Trump of TDS within that timeframe. The current date given is June 9, 2025, so the event in question has already occurred.\n\nLooking through the search results, there are a few key sources. Search result [3] from CBS News on June 5, 2025, mentions Trump's comments about Elon Musk having \"Trump derangement syndrome\" during a meeting with the German Chancellor. The exact quote is: \"I don't know what it is. It's sort of Trump derangement syndrome, I guess they call it.\" This is a verbal mention during a public event, which was recorded and reported by CBS News. The date is within the specified timeframe (May 24 to May 30), so this would count.\n\nAnother mention is in search result [14] from Fox News on June 6, 2025, where Trump suggested Musk might have TDS. However, the exact date of the event is June 5, which is within the window. The transcript from the Oval Office meeting on June 5, 2025, confirms this.\n\nAdditionally, search result [16] from Inside Edition on June 5, 2025, reports Trump stating that Musk has \"Trump Derangement Syndrome.\" This is another verbal mention within the timeframe.\n\nThere's also a video source [7] from KTLA 5 News on June 5, 2025, where Trump mentions TDS in relation to Musk. The transcript includes his statement during the meeting with the German Chancellor.\n\nAll these instances are within the May 24 to May 30 window and are verbal mentions in recorded media. There are no conflicting reports indicating that Trump did not make these statements during that period. Therefore, based on the provided sources, Trump did mention \"Trump Derangement Syndrome\" within the specified timeframe.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0, ID: 57654316986792395625678332076289553860119760490323901911338545628783604199156, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 1, ID: 33938798500872628136793380283537276443625836153133793041762595949432456765120, Winner: Yes\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The user wants to know if the market should resolve to \"Yes\" because Trump mentioned \"Trump Derangement Syndrome\" (TDS) during the specified time frame. The ancillary data says the market resolves to \"Yes\" if Trump verbally mentions the term between May 24, 12 PM ET and May 30, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. Written statements don't count, only recorded audio or video.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mentions by Trump of TDS in that timeframe. The current date given is June 9, 2025, so the event in question is in the past. The user mentioned that a previous response returned p2 (Yes), but they want a different approach or alternative data sources.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are several mentions of Trump using TDS. For example, in result [6], from June 7, 2025, Trump accuses Elon Musk of having TDS. However, June 7 is outside the specified window (May 24-30). Similarly, result [52] from June 7 also mentions Trump's accusation against Musk. \n\nResult [50] is a video transcript from June 6, 2025, where Trump says Musk has TDS. Again, June 6 is within the May 24-30 window? Wait, May has 31 days, so May 30 is the end date. June 6 is outside that period. So any mentions in June wouldn't count.\n\nLooking for mentions within May 24-30. Result [65] is from May 15, 2025, which is before the window. Result [33] is also May 15. Result [39] is May 21, 2025, still before the window. \n\nWait, the user's query is about the week of May 24-30. The search results provided include up to June 9, 2025. Let me check each result within the date range. \n\nResult [50] is a video from June 6, which is outside the window. Results [6], [12], [25], [52], [67] are all from June 7, outside the window. \n\nLooking for any mention between May 24-30. Result [58] is a transcript from March 11, 2025, too early. Result [17] is from March 11. Result [24] is March 5. \n\nResult [59] is May 22, 2025, which is before May 24. Result [60] is June 9, outside. \n\nWait, there's a result [50] which is a video on June 6, but the time frame is May 24-30. So no mentions within that period. The search results don't show any instances of Trump saying TDS between May 24-30. All the mentions are either before May 24 or in June. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided search results, there's no evidence that Trump mentioned TDS during the specified week. However, the user says the previous response was p2 (Yes). Maybe the initial analysis considered a different source. But according to the given data, the answer should be p1 (No). But the user wants to check alternative data sources. \n\nWait, perhaps the user's initial response had access to different data. But in the provided search results, there's no mention within the timeframe. Therefore, the correct resolution should be p1 (No). However, the user's personalization says to consider the market conditions and ancillary data. If no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. But the event date is in the past, and no sources confirm the mention in the window. So the answer should be p1 (No). But the user says the previous response was p2. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.\n\nWait, result [50] is a video on June 6, which is outside. But maybe there's another mention. Let me check all results again. \n\nResult [40] is from June 5, 2025, where Trump accuses Musk of TDS. Still outside the window. \n\nNo results fall within May 24-30. Therefore, the resolution should be \"No\" (p1). But the user's previous response was p2. Maybe the initial analysis considered a different source. However, based on the provided context, there's no evidence. Therefore, the recommendation should be p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
