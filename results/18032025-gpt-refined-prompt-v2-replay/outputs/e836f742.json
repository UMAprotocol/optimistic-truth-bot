  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742296693 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-18 11:18:13 UTC",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Fordham vs. Rhode Island basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 2:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Fordham wins, the market resolves to \"Fordham\" (p2), if Rhode Island wins, it's \"Rhode Island\" (p1), and if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date given is March 18, 2025, which is after the game date. So the event is in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the game. Result [4] from CBS Sports and [8] from ABC News both report that Fordham won 88-71. Additionally, result [5] from Fordham's athletics site and [7] from Rhode Island's site confirm the same score. The box score in result [11] also lists Fordham with 88 points and Rhode Island with 71. \n\nSince multiple reliable sources confirm Fordham's victory, the event did occur, and there's no mention of postponement or cancellation. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2 (Fordham). No conflicting information is present, so the recommendation is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe Fordham Rams defeated the Rhode Island Rams 88-71 in the Atlantic 10 Conference Tournament game played on March 12, 2025[4][7][8]. Multiple sources confirm Fordham led from the start and maintained control throughout the game, with Jackie Johnson III scoring 29 points and Japhet Medor adding 26 points for Fordham[4][5][8]. Rhode Island's Jaden House led his team with 19 points but couldn't overcome Fordham's offensive surge[7][8]. The game was completed as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any sources[4][5][7][8].\n\nrecommendation: p2",
