  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742296789 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-18 11:19:49 UTC",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Virginia vs. Georgia Tech basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 12:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Virginia wins, it's p2; Georgia Tech wins, p1; postponed remains open; canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The system says it's March 18, 2025, which is after the game date. So the event has already occurred. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 13) mention the March 12 game. For example, result [2] from the ACC's official site states Georgia Tech won 66-60. Similarly, [3] from Virginia's sports site confirms the loss. ESPN's recap in [5] and CBS Sports in [7] also report Georgia Tech's victory. \n\nI should cross-check to ensure there's no conflicting information. All sources consistently report Georgia Tech as the winner. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Therefore, the market should resolve to p1, corresponding to Georgia Tech's win. \n\nNo sources indicate any issues with the game's completion, so p3 isn't applicable. The answer is clear from the search results.\n</think>\n\nThe ACC Tournament second-round game between Georgia Tech and Virginia on March 12, 2025, resulted in a **66-60 victory for Georgia Tech**[2][3][5][7][10]. This marked the Yellow Jackets' first win over Virginia since January 2016, snapping a 13-game losing streak in the series[5][7][13]. Key factors included:\n\n- **Duncan Powell's 21-point performance** (15 in the second half)[5][7]\n- **Double-doubles from Baye Ndongo** (16 points, 10 rebounds) and **Naithan George** (13 points, 10 rebounds, 8 assists)[2][5]\n- Georgia Tech's **44-26 rebounding advantage** and **40-24 edge in paint scoring**[2][3]\n\nVirginia's Isaac McKneely led all scorers with 27 points (7/11 three-pointers)[3][5], but the Cavaliers shot just 36.2% from the field[3][13]. The game was tied 25-25 at halftime before Georgia Tech built a 13-point lead late in the second half[2][3].\n\nThe outcome meets the resolution conditions specified in the ancillary data, as the game was completed as scheduled with no postponement or cancellation. \n\nrecommendation: p1",
