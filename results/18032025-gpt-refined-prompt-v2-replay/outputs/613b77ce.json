  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742297972 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-18 11:39:32 UTC",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"God\" two or more times during his press conference with the Irish Prime Minister on March 12, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The key sources here are the transcripts and videos from the event. Looking at the search results, there's a transcript from the White House St. Patrick's Day Reception (source 14 and 15). In the transcript, Trump mentions \"faith in God\" when talking about the parishioners defending St. Patrick's Church. He says, \"they had a big faith in God. They said, 'God will never do this to us.'\" That's two instances of \"God\" right there. \n\nAdditionally, in another part of the transcript (source 15), he refers to \"faith in God\" again, which would count as two mentions. The exact quotes are crucial here. The user specified that any usage, including pluralization or possessive, counts, but other forms don't. In this case, both instances are the exact term \"God.\" \n\nThe event in question is the St. Patrick's Day Reception, which the update mentions is the basis for resolution. The transcripts clearly show Trump used \"God\" twice. There's no ambiguity here. Since the requirement was two or more mentions, and he did that, the resolution should be p2 (Yes). I need to make sure there are no other instances or contexts where he might have said it more, but even with these two, it's sufficient. No conflicting information in the sources suggests the event was canceled or that the term wasn't used. Therefore, the answer is p2.\n</think>\n\nDonald Trump mentioned the word \"God\" at least twice during the St. Patrick's Day reception with Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin on March 12, 2025. In his remarks, he referenced parishioners defending St. Patrick's Church during the War of 1812, stating they \"had a big faith in God\" and repeated the phrase \"God will never do this to us\" when describing their actions[14][15]. \n\nThis fulfills the market's requirement of two+ utterances of \"God\" during the event. The resolution source (event transcript/video) confirms both instances occurred in the designated appearance.\n\nrecommendation: p2",
