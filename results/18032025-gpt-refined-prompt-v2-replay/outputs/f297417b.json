  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742296596 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-18 11:16:36 UTC",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if the price of a dozen Grade A Large eggs in the U.S. reached or exceeded $5.00 between January and March 2025, based on the FRED data from the St. Louis Fed. \n\nFirst, I need to check the resolution conditions. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if any data point in those three months is $5.00 or higher. The ancillary data specifies that the resolution source is the FRED series APU0000708111, which uses BLS CPI data. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's conflicting information. Source [2] (NerdWallet) mentions the average price in February was $5.90, up from $4.95 in January. Source [3] (Fortune) also states February's price at $5.90, but notes that the BLS data showed a 12.5% increase from January to February. However, source [6] (Wisconsin Ag Connection) reports a daily national average of $8.15 per dozen by March, which seems higher. \n\nBut wait, source [8] (USDA AMS report) from March 14, 2025, shows wholesale prices declining to $4.15 per dozen. However, this is wholesale, not retail. The FRED data tracks retail prices. Source [13] (FRED data) as of December 2024 was $4.146, but the user needs data up to March 2025. \n\nSource [5] (Fast Company) mentions a tracker predicting $7.09 in January 2025, but this might be futures, not the actual BLS data. Source [6] also mentions the average price in January was $4.95, then rose to $8.15 by March. However, the USDA report in [6] might refer to different data. \n\nThe key here is to rely on the BLS data as per the resolution source. The conflicting reports from NerdWallet and Fortune both cite February's price at $5.90, which is above $5.00. Even if March's data isn't explicitly stated, the February data alone would trigger a \"Yes\" resolution. However, the USDA's March report in [8] shows a decline, but that's wholesale. The FRED retail data for March isn't directly provided in the search results, but the user's query is about January to March. Since February's data from BLS (cited in [2] and [3]) is $5.90, which meets the condition, the market should resolve to \"Yes\". \n\nBut wait, the ancillary data says the resolution is based on the FRED data updated by the St. Louis Fed. The search results don't have the March 2025 data point, but the February data is already above $5.00. Therefore, regardless of March's numbers, the February data alone satisfies the condition. \n\nThus, the answer should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nThe market will resolve to **Yes (p2)** based on available data. Here's the analysis:\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics data published through FRED (the designated resolution source), February 2025 saw egg prices reach $5.90 per dozen[2][3]. This meets the $5.00 threshold specified in the resolution conditions.\n\nKey evidence:\n- Multiple sources confirm February's average price exceeded $5.00[2][3][6]\n- The resolution criteria only require **one monthly datapoint** between January-March 2025 to meet/exceed $5.00[1]\n- While March 2025 wholesale prices showed declines[8], the resolution specifically uses retail price data from BLS/FRED\n\nThough some sources show price volatility and conflicting March estimates[5][6], the February data alone satisfies the resolution requirements. The 3-decimal precision requirement ($5.000+) is met by February's $5.90 figure[2][3].\n\nrecommendation: p2",
