  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742297619 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-18 11:33:39 UTC",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know whether PSV Eindhoven or Arsenal advanced in the UEFA Champions League Round of 16. The ancillary data specifies that if Arsenal advances, it resolves to p1 (Arsenal), and if PSV advances, p2 (PSV). If the match is canceled or postponed beyond December 31, 2025, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to determine the outcome. Looking at the sources provided:\n\n- Source [1] from Sky Sports mentions that Arsenal drew 2-2 with PSV but progressed 9-3 on aggregate. The article states, \"Arsenal set up a Champions League quarter-final showdown with either Atletico Madrid or Real Madrid as a 2-2 draw with PSV Eindhoven at the Emirates Stadium sealed a 9-3 aggregate win.\" This clearly indicates Arsenal advanced.\n\n- Source [2] is a YouTube video titled \"Extended HIGHLIGHTS || UEFA Champions League R-16 2nd LEG!\" which also states that Arsenal secured a 9-3 aggregate victory. The description confirms the aggregate score.\n\n- Source [3] from ESPN details the first leg where Arsenal won 7-1, contributing to the aggregate score. The second leg, covered in source [5] and [8], ended 2-2, leading to a 9-3 aggregate win for Arsenal.\n\n- Sources [4], [6], and [7] all discuss the first leg's result and the second leg's context, reinforcing that Arsenal had a massive lead from the first match.\n\nAll sources consistently report that Arsenal advanced with a 9-3 aggregate score. There's no mention of the match being canceled or postponed. The event date (March 12, 2025) is before the cutoff date of December 31, 2025, so the 50-50 condition doesn't apply. \n\nTherefore, based on the official UEFA Champions League results as reported by these sources, the resolution should be p1 (Arsenal).\n</think>\n\nArsenal advanced to the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals by defeating PSV Eindhoven with a **9-3 aggregate score** across the two legs of their Round of 16 tie[1][2][5][8].  \n\n### Match Summary  \n- **First Leg (PSV 1-7 Arsenal):**  \n  Arsenal delivered a historic performance in Eindhoven, securing a 7-1 victory[3][6][7]. Goals came from seven different players, including Martin \u00d8degaard (2), Ethan Nwaneri, and Leandro Trossard. This marked PSV\u2019s heaviest home defeat in club history[6][7].  \n\n- **Second Leg (Arsenal 2-2 PSV):**  \n  Despite a rotated squad, Arsenal drew 2-2 at home. Oleksandr Zinchenko and Declan Rice scored for Arsenal, while PSV\u2019s Ivan Perisic and Couhaib Driouech leveled twice[1][5][8]. The result confirmed Arsenal\u2019s aggregate dominance (9-3)[1][8].  \n\n### Key Details  \n- **Aggregate Score:** Arsenal\u2019s 7-1 first-leg win effectively decided the tie, with the second leg serving as a formality[3][5][8].  \n- **Quarter-Final Opponent:** Arsenal progressed to face either Real Madrid or Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in the next round[1][5].  \n\nrecommendation: p1",
