  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742297819 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-18 11:36:59 UTC",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Israel\" during his press conference with the Irish Prime Minister on March 12, 2025. The resolution conditions are p2 for Yes and p1 for No. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The key sources here are the transcript from the YouTube video [1] and other articles. The transcript includes Trump's remarks during the event. Let me look through the transcript snippets.\n\nIn the transcript from [1], Trump mentions Israel several times. For example, he says, \"Israel is Been Under Siege as you can see and they had to fight back October 7th was a terrible thing...\" and later refers to \"working hard with Israel.\" He also mentions \"Israel\" again when discussing hostages. Each of these instances is during the press conference part of the event, as per the query's focus on the scheduled presser.\n\nThe other articles, like [3], [4], and [8], also report Trump's statements about Israel during the meeting with Martin, but I need to confirm if these were part of the press conference. The query specifies that the press conference includes any Q&A, so the exchanges where Trump answers questions about Israel would count. The transcript from [1] shows Trump responding to a question about Ireland's relationship with Israel, which fits the press conference context.\n\nThe ancillary data states that any usage of \"Israel\" in any form (including pluralization or possessive) counts. Trump uses \"Israel\" directly multiple times. There's no mention of the event being canceled, so the resolution can't be p1 for that reason. All evidence points to Trump saying \"Israel\" during the press conference. Therefore, the resolution should be p2 (Yes).\n</think>\n\nBased on the video transcript of the March 12, 2025 St. Patrick's Day press conference between Donald Trump and Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin, Trump explicitly used the term **\"Israel\"** multiple times during the event[1][3][8]. Key instances include:\n\n- **Direct reference to Israel's security situation**:  \n  *\"Israel is Been Under Siege as you can see and they had to fight back October 7th was a terrible thing...\"*[1]  \n- **Mention of U.S.-Israel collaboration**:  \n  *\"we're working hard with Israel we're working hard to see we can solve the problem...\"*[1]  \n- **Discussion of hostages held by Hamas**:  \n  *\"I just saw 10 hostages... they were treated really badly\"*[1], with context confirming these were Israeli hostages[3][8].  \n\nThe query's resolution conditions specify that **any usage of \"Israel\"** during the press conference qualifies for a \"Yes\" resolution (p2), regardless of context. The term appears verbatim in the transcript, meeting the criteria. No evidence suggests the event was canceled or unaired.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",
