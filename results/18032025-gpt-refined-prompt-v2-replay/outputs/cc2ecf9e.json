  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742297795 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-18 11:36:35 UTC",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump said \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" during his press conference with the Irish PM on March 12, 2025. The resolution conditions are p2 for Yes, p1 for No, and p3 if uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The user included several sources about the meeting between Trump and Martin. Let me go through each one to see if any mention Trump using those terms during the press conference.\n\nLooking at the search results, most of them discuss the trade issues, tariffs, and the St. Patrick's Day events. For example, sources [2], [3], [4], [8], [9], [13], [15], [17], [18], and [19] detail the discussions about Ireland's trade practices, pharmaceutical companies, and the EU. There's a lot about the bilateral meeting and the press conference, but none of these sources mention Trump using \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" during that specific event.\n\nSource [5] and [10]-[12] talk about Trump's AI executive order and investments in AI infrastructure, but these are from January 2025, not during the March 12 press conference. The press conference in question is on March 12, and the AI-related announcements were made earlier. \n\nSource [6] and [1] mention AI-generated videos related to Trump and Zelenskyy, but that's a different event in March, not the press conference with Martin. \n\nThe transcripts from the press conference with Martin (sources [4], [7], [17]) don't show any mention of AI. The discussions revolve around trade, tariffs, housing, and other topics. Even when asked about advice for Ireland's housing crisis, Trump didn't bring up AI. \n\nSince none of the sources indicate that Trump used the terms \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" during the March 12 press conference, the answer should resolve to \"No\". The event happened as scheduled, so there's no cancellation issue. All the evidence points to the terms not being mentioned during that specific event.\n</think>\n\nBased on analysis of the press conference transcript and related coverage, Donald Trump did not use the terms \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" during his March 12, 2025 St. Patrick's Day reception with Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin. The discussion focused on trade relations, pharmaceutical companies, and geopolitical issues rather than technology policy[4][7][17].\n\nKey evidence:\n- Full transcripts of the Oval Office meeting and press conference show no mentions of AI-related terminology[4][7]\n- Trade disputes dominated the agenda, with Trump criticizing Ireland's corporate tax policies and pharmaceutical industry[2][13][17]\n- While Trump announced major AI investments in January 2025[10][12], this policy wasn't referenced during the March 12 event\n- Coverage of the meeting from multiple outlets confirms the absence of AI discussions[3][9][15][18]\n\nThe press conference occurred as scheduled with no cancellation reported[9][14]. As no instances of the specified terms were documented in the resolution source (the press conference itself), this market resolves to \"No\".\n\nrecommendation: p1",
