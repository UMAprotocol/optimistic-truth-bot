  "user_prompt": "\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Will Russia recapture Sudzha by March 31?, description: This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if, according to the ISW map, Russia captures the Sudzha railroad station located on Privokzal'naya ulitsa by March 31, 2025 at 11:59 PM ET.\n\nThe railroad station will be considered captured if any part of the train station icon is shaded red on the ISW map (https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/36a7f6a6f5a9448496de641cf64bd375) by the resolution date. If the area is not shaded red by April 30, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, the market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nOnce Russia captures the railroad station, any subsequent loss of control will not be considered towards the resolution of this market.\n\nIf Russia comes into control of this territory as a result of a negotiated settlement, this will qualify for a 'Yes' resolution, regardless of if it is shaded red in the ISW map. An announcement of a negotiated settlement which gives Russia de jure control will not qualify. Actual control must be established.\n\nTrain Station Location: https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/sudzha+train+station.png\n\nSudzha Location: https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Sudzha+location.jpeg\n\nLocation on Google maps: https://maps.app.goo.gl/s7MXZ3FSQBaVkAMk9\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be the ISW Ukraine map. If the ISW map is rendered unavailable, information from DeepStateMap (https://deepstatemap.live/) may be used.

  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742297698 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-18 11:34:58 UTC",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking whether Russia will recapture Sudzha's railroad station by March 31, 2025, based on the ISW map. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The given current date is March 18, 2025. The event in question is whether the station is captured by March 31, which is in the future. But wait, the user's ancillary data says the market resolves based on the ISW map by March 31. However, the search results include information up to March 17, 2025. Let me look through the sources to see if there's any confirmation that Russia has already taken the station.\n\nLooking at the search results, source [8] from March 12 mentions that Russian forces seized Sudzha and advanced to southern Zaoleshenka. Source [13] from March 12 states that Ukrainian troops fully withdrew from Sudzha, and Russian forces are in control. Source [15], also from March 12, confirms that geolocated footage shows Russian forces seized Sudzha. Additionally, source [17] from March 15 mentions that Russia announced recapturing Goncharovka and other settlements, with drone footage supporting Sudzha's recapture.\n\nThe key point is the railroad station on Privokzal'naya ulitsa. Source [3] provides details about the Krasnodar-1 station at Privokzal'naya Ulitsa 1, but that's in Krasnodar, not Sudzha. Wait, the user provided a Google Maps link for the Sudzha train station. Let me check the search results again. Source [10] discusses the Sudzha train station, confirming its location with coordinates matching the user's query. Source [9] mentions a video showing Russian soldiers at the Sudzha station entrance. Source [13] from March 12 says Ukrainian forces withdrew, and Russian forces are in control, including the central square. If the station is in Sudzha and Russia has control of the city, then the station is likely under their control.\n\nSince the current date is March 18, and the event deadline is March 31, but the sources up to March 15 already report Russian control, the event has already occurred. Therefore, the answer should resolve to Yes (p2). However, I need to ensure that the specific railroad station icon on the ISW map is shaded red. The sources mention ISW's confirmation of Sudzha's capture by March 12, which would imply the station is under Russian control. Since the user's resolution condition states that once captured, subsequent loss doesn't affect the outcome, and the current date is before March 31, the answer is Yes.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
