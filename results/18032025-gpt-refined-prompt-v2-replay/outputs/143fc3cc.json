  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742296402 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-18 11:13:22 UTC",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Kevin O'Connell will be traded by March 12, 2025, based on the provided sources. First, I need to check the current date, which is March 18, 2025. The deadline was March 12, so the event has already passed. Now, I need to look through the search results to see if there's any information about a trade happening by that date.\n\nLooking at the sources, there's a lot of talk about teams being interested in trading for O'Connell, especially around January 2025. However, the Vikings consistently stated they had no plans to trade him. For example, source [3] mentions a Vikings source saying, \"We love Kevin and there will be no trade.\" Also, source [11] from January 22, 2025, states that the Vikings and O'Connell agreed to a multi-year extension, which would effectively end any trade possibilities. \n\nSince the extension was signed before March 12, 2025, it's clear that O'Connell wasn't traded. The resolution conditions specify that if he's traded by the deadline, it's \"Yes\" (p2), otherwise \"No\" (p1). All the recent sources confirm he's staying with the Vikings, so the answer should resolve to \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nKevin O'Connell, head coach of the Minnesota Vikings, will not be traded, as the Vikings signed him to a **multi-year contract extension** on January 21, 2025[11][13]. This extension came after weeks of speculation sparked by reports that multiple NFL teams were considering trading for O'Connell due to his impending contract expiration in 2025[1][2][4][7]. Key details:\n\n- **Contract Status**: O\u2019Connell\u2019s original four-year deal (signed in 2022) was set to expire after the 2025 season, with no extension talks occurring during the 2024 season[6][9]. This created leverage for O\u2019Connell and prompted external interest[14].\n- **Vikings\u2019 Stance**: Team ownership and management repeatedly emphasized their commitment to retaining O\u2019Connell, calling him \u201ca critical part of our future\u201d[3][6][9]. A Vikings source explicitly stated, *\u201cWe love Kevin and there will be no trade\u201d*[3].\n- **Post-Season Resolution**: After Minnesota\u2019s playoff exit, O\u2019Connell confirmed his desire to stay[9], and the two sides finalized an extension less than three weeks after the initial trade rumors surfaced[11][13]. The deal ensures O\u2019Connell will not enter the 2025 season as a lame-duck coach.\n\nThe resolution deadline for this market (March 12, 2025) has passed, and no trade occurred. Official reporting confirms O\u2019Connell remains under contract with Minnesota[11][13]. \n\nrecommendation: p1",
