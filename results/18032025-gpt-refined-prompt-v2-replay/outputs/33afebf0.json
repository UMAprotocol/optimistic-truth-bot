  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742295792 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-18 11:03:12 UTC",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Phoenix Suns vs. Houston Rockets game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Rockets win, it's p1; Suns win, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date given is March 18, 2025, which is after the game date. So the event is in the past. Now, I need to confirm the result. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources report the game took place. The ESPN recap [7] states the Rockets won 111-104. CBS Sports [2] and Fox Sports [8] both confirm the same score. YouTube highlights [1][4][5] also mention the Rockets' victory with Jalen Green scoring 29 points. Additionally, Burn City Sports [6] details the Rockets' win and the Suns' loss, dropping them six games below .500. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. The fight between Adams and Plumlee led to ejections but didn't affect the game's completion. All sources agree the game was played and concluded with a Rockets victory. \n\nSince the Rockets won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. No conflicting information found, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe NBA game between the Phoenix Suns and Houston Rockets on March 12, 2025, concluded with the **Houston Rockets winning 111-104** [2][7][8]. Jalen Green led the Rockets with 29 points, supported by Alperen \u015eeng\u00fcn (20 points) and Dillon Brooks (19 points) [2][6][7]. The game featured a second-quarter altercation between Steven Adams and Mason Plumlee, resulting in both players being ejected [2][4][6]. Bradley Beal scored 25 points for the Suns, while Devin Booker and Kevin Durant each added 19 points [6][7].  \n\nThe Rockets maintained control with a 9-2 fourth-quarter run to secure their fourth consecutive win, while the Suns fell to 30-36, struggling in the Western Conference play-in race [6][7]. The game was not postponed or canceled, and all sources confirm it concluded as scheduled.  \n\n**recommendation: p1**",
