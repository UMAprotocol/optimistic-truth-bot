  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742297778 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-18 11:36:18 UTC",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the MD Eastern Shore vs. Norfolk State game on March 12, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Norfolk State wins, it's p1; MD Eastern Shore, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and outcome. The current date given is March 18, 2025, so the game on March 12 is in the past. Checking the search results, multiple sources (1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11) report that Norfolk State won 77-70 against MD Eastern Shore on March 12. The game was part of the MEAC Tournament quarterfinals. \n\nNext, ensure the event wasn't postponed or canceled. All sources mention the game occurred as scheduled. No indications of cancellation or postponement. The final score is consistent across reports, with Norfolk State as the clear winner. \n\nSince the event happened, and Norfolk State won, the resolution should be p1. No conflicting information in the sources. All conditions are met for p1.\n</think>\n\nThe MEAC Tournament quarterfinal game between Norfolk State and Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) took place as scheduled on March 12, 2025, at 6:00 PM ET. **Norfolk State defeated UMES 77-70**[1][4][6][8][9][11], with Jalen Myers leading the Spartans with 22 points. The game was not postponed or canceled, and all sources confirm the final outcome occurred on the scheduled date. \n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided:\n- **Norfolk State's victory** directly corresponds to **p1**  \n- The game was completed without postponement or cancellation  \n\n**recommendation: p1**",
