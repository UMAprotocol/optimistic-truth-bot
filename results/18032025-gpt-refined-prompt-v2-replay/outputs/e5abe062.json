  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742296356 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-18 11:12:36 UTC",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Saint Patrick\" during his press conference with the Irish Prime Minister on March 12, 2025. The resolution conditions are specific: p2 (Yes) if he used the exact term, considering pluralization or possessive forms, but not other variations. The event in question is the St. Patrick's Day Reception at 5 PM ET.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of Trump using \"Saint Patrick\" during that event. Let's go through the sources. \n\nLooking at source [9], the transcript of the Oval Office meeting, Trump says, \"It's a great honor to have Miche\u00e1l Martin... to celebrate St. Patrick's with you.\" Here, he uses \"St. Patrick's,\" which is a possessive form. According to the resolution conditions, possessive forms count, so this would qualify. \n\nSource [11] and [12] are transcripts from the St. Patrick's Day reception. In [11], Trump says, \"happy St. Patrick's Day\" and refers to \"Saint Patrick's Cathedral.\" The exact term \"Saint Patrick\" is used here. Similarly, in [12], he mentions \"St. Patrick's Day\" again. \n\nSource [10] and [13] mention Trump mistakenly calling Saint Patrick a \"patriot saint\" during the reception. Even though he fumbled, he still said \"Saint Patrick.\" \n\nThe key here is that the press conference in question is the St. Patrick's Day Reception, and multiple sources confirm Trump used \"Saint Patrick\" in his remarks. Even with the slip-up, the term was uttered. Therefore, the market should resolve to Yes (p2).\n</think>\n\nPresident Donald Trump did use the term \"Saint Patrick\" during his March 12, 2025 St. Patrick's Day reception with Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin. Multiple transcripts and news reports confirm he referenced \"Saint Patrick's Cathedral\" in New York City during his remarks, calling it \"one of THE MOST beautiful cathedrals in the world\" and describing it as \"a monument not only to God but also to the patron Saint of Ireland\" [10][13]. While he later misspoke by calling Saint Patrick a \"patriot saint\" [10][13], both instances involved direct usage of the required term.\n\nThe White House reception (scheduled for 5 PM ET) included Trump's formal remarks where he:\n1. Repeatedly referenced \"St. Patrick's Day\" as the occasion [11][12][15]\n2. Specifically used the full term \"Saint Patrick\" when discussing the cathedral [10][13]\n3. Made multiple possessive references to \"St. Patrick's\" [9][11]\n\nPer the resolution conditions, possessive forms like \"St. Patrick's\" qualify as valid instances. The market explicitly includes the scheduled reception (not just a press conference Q&A) as part of the qualifying event window. No evidence suggests the event was canceled or unaired.\n\nrecommendation: p2",
