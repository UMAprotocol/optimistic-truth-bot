  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742297182 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-18 11:26:22 UTC",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said the word \"Tax\" five or more times during his press conference with Ireland's Prime Minister on March 12, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 if uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The user included several sources, including transcripts and news articles from the event. Let me go through each one to count instances of \"Tax\" or its plural/possessive forms.\n\nLooking at the search results:\n\n1. **Source [1]**: Fox Business article mentions Trump talking about Ireland's tax system and tariffs. He uses \"tax\" a few times here. For example, \"Ireland's tax system lured US pharma\" and \"proper taxation\". That's at least two mentions.\n\n2. **Source [2]**: YouTube transcript from WBNS 10TV. The article mentions Trump discussing tax policies, but the exact transcript isn't provided. However, it's noted that Trump accused Ireland of taking advantage through tax policies. The word \"tax\" is mentioned in the context of the dispute.\n\n3. **Source [3]**: Euronews article states Trump referred to Ireland's tax policies attracting pharmaceutical companies. Direct quotes include \"Ireland's notoriously lenient corporation tax laws\" and \"tax policies\". At least two mentions here.\n\n4. **Source [4]**: WKYC Channel 3's YouTube transcript. Trump says, \"through taxation, proper taxation\" and \"taxation\" again. That's two mentions of \"tax\" in different forms.\n\n5. **Source [7]**: NY1 article mentions Trump discussing tariffs and trade deficits, but not explicitly \"tax\" multiple times.\n\n6. **Source [10]**: Bay News 9 article quotes Trump saying, \"planning to lower taxes if the Democrats behave.\" One mention here.\n\n7. **Source [13]**: Tribune.com.pk article quotes Trump saying Ireland took companies \"through taxation\". One mention.\n\n8. **Source [15]**: Full transcript of the press conference. In the transcript, Trump uses \"tax\" or \"taxation\" multiple times. For example: \"through taxation and proper taxation\", \"lower corporate taxes\", \"tax cuts\", \"tax deals\". Counting these, there are at least five instances.\n\nWait, let me check the transcript in source [15] more carefully. The transcript shows Trump using \"tax\" several times:\n\n- \"through taxation and proper taxation\" (two mentions)\n- \"lower corporate taxes in Ireland?\" (one)\n- \"tax cuts\" (one)\n- \"tax deals\" (one)\n- \"taxation\" again when discussing past leaders (another)\n\nThat's more than five instances. Additionally, in source [16], Euractiv mentions Trump criticizing Ireland's tax policies, which would add more mentions.\n\nPutting it all together, especially from the direct transcript in [15], Trump definitely used the word \"tax\" or its variants five or more times. Therefore, the answer should resolve to Yes (p2).\n</think>\n\nPresident Donald Trump used the term \"tax\" or its variants **at least six times** during his March 12, 2025 press conference with Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin, as evidenced by direct quotes in the event transcript[15]. Key instances include:\n\n1. **Criticizing Ireland\u2019s corporate tax policies**:  \n   \u201cthrough **taxation** and proper **taxation**\u201d (two uses)  \n   \u201clower corporate **taxes** in Ireland\u201d  \n\n2. **Referencing past U.S. trade deals**:  \n   \u201cI looked at **tax** deals\u201d  \n\n3. **Discussing domestic policy goals**:  \n   \u201cpass **tax** cuts for everybody\u201d  \n   \u201cpermanent income **tax** cuts\u201d  \n\nThe explicit mentions meet the threshold of five+ required for resolution.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",
