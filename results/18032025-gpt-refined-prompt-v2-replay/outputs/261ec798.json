  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742296552 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-18 11:15:52 UTC",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Volodymyr Zelenskyy will say \"Trans\" during his press conference with Ireland's PM Miche\u00e1l Martin on March 12, 2025. Wait, wait, hold on. The query mentions Zelenskyy, but the event is between Trump and Martin. That might be a mix-up. Let me check the ancillary data again. Oh, the title says Zelenskyy, but the description refers to Trump's press conference. That's confusing. Maybe it's a typo. The resolution conditions are about Trump's presser with Martin. So the user might have made a mistake in the title, but the actual market is about Trump's press conference.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm if Trump used the word \"Trans\" during his press conference with Martin. The search results provided are from March 12, 2025, which is the date in question. Let's look through the sources.\n\nLooking at source [1], Trump is quoted saying \"everything is transgender\" and \"everybody transgender\" during a press conference on March 12. That's the exact date of the event. The article from PinkNews mentions this happened during a meeting with Miche\u00e1l Martin. Source [4] and [5] are transcripts from the press conference where Trump says, \"everything's transgender, everybody transgender.\" Source [18] also mentions Trump's comments about everything being transgender during the presser with the Irish PM. \n\nThe key point here is that the term \"transgender\" was used by Trump, and the market resolution is based on whether the term \"Trans\" is mentioned. The resolution conditions state that any form, including pluralization or possessive, counts. \"Transgender\" includes the root \"Trans,\" so that should qualify. Even though the exact word \"Trans\" wasn't used, \"transgender\" is a compound that includes \"Trans.\" According to the rules, compound words count regardless of context. Therefore, Trump's use of \"transgender\" would trigger a \"Yes\" resolution.\n\nAdditionally, the event did occur on March 12, as per the sources, so there's no cancellation issue. The press conference was part of the St. Patrick's Day events, and the transcripts confirm Trump's remarks. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nDonald Trump did use the term \"transgender\" multiple times during his March 12, 2025 press conference with Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin. In remarks captured across multiple sources, Trump stated: **\"everything's transgender, everybody transgender\"** while discussing his administration's policies and election strategy[1][4][5][18]. \n\nThe resolution conditions specify that:\n1. Any usage of the root term \"Trans\" (including in compound words like \"transgender\") counts regardless of context[1][18]\n2. The press conference occurred as scheduled on March 12[3][4][7]\n3. Video evidence from the event confirms the utterance[4][5][19]\n\nWhile Ukrainian President Zelenskyy was not involved in this event (likely a title error), the market explicitly resolves based on Trump's remarks during the designated press conference with Martin. The repeated use of \"transgender\" satisfies the compound word requirement under the resolution criteria.\n\nrecommendation: p2",
