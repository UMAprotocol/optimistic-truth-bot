  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742295966 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-18 11:06:06 UTC",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if the Oklahoma City Thunder will make the 2025 NBA Playoffs, with specific resolution conditions. The ancillary data says that reaching the Play-In Tournament doesn't count; they need to be in the top 16 playoff spots. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if they make it, \"No\" (p1) if not, and p3 if uncertain.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date provided, which is March 18, 2025. The search results include information up to March 15, 2025. Let's look through the sources.\n\nSearch result [1] from March 15 mentions the Thunder lead the Western Conference playoff picture and their playoff odds are off the board (over 99% implied probability). It also states they clinched the No. 1 seed last year and made the playoffs in 2023-24. But this is about last season, not the current one.\n\nWait, no, looking again: [1] says \"After claiming the No. 1 seed last year, the Oklahoma City Thunder lead the 2025 NBA playoff picture.\" So \"last year\" here refers to 2023-24, and now in 2025, they're leading again. Their playoff chances are off the board, meaning they're virtually certain to make it.\n\nSearch result [3] from March 15 explicitly states, \"The Thunder have clinched a playoff spot in the West.\" That's a direct confirmation. The article also mentions they clinched on Wednesday in Boston, which would be around March 12, 2025, given the current date is March 18.\n\nAnother source, [8] (updated March 14), lists the Thunder as having clinched playoffs (marked with (x)) in the Western Conference standings. They're the top seed with a 54-12 record, far ahead of others. This confirms they've secured a playoff spot, not just the Play-In.\n\nAdditionally, [4] mentions the Thunder's championship odds but notes they don't have playoff odds because it's a near certainty. [6] discusses their first-round schedule as the top seed, which implies they're already in the playoffs.\n\nThe key point is that the resolution condition requires the team to be in the playoffs, not just the Play-In. Since multiple sources confirm the Thunder have clinched a playoff spot, they are guaranteed a top 6 seed, avoiding the Play-In. Therefore, the answer should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder have clinched a playoff spot in the 2024-25 NBA season, securing their position in the postseason bracket. As of March 14, 2025, the Thunder hold the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference with a 54-12 record, 13 games ahead of the second-place Houston Rockets[3][8]. Official sources confirm they **locked their playoff berth** on March 12, 2025, during a game against the Boston Celtics[3]. \n\nThe team\u2019s playoff odds were listed as \"off the board\" (effectively 100%) due to their dominant performance[1][4], and they are projected to face the play-in tournament winner in the first round[6]. Since the Thunder have already secured a top-six seed, they **avoid the play-in tournament entirely**, meeting the resolution condition of earning a direct playoff spot[3][8]. \n\nrecommendation: p2",
