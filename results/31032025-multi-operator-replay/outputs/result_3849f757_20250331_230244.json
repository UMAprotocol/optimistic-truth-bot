The ancillary data specifies that if the Sabres win, it's p2 (\"Sabres\"), and if the Capitals win, it's p1 (\"Capitals\"). If postponed, the market stays open; if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current date provided is March 31, 2025, which is after the game's scheduled date of March 30. So the event has already occurred. Now, I need to determine the actual outcome using the search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the result. Source [1] is a YouTube video titled \"EIGHT GOALS! | Buffalo Sabres Defeat Washington Capitals in 8-5 win\" dated March 31, 2025. The description mentions the Sabres won 8-5. Source [2] from NHL.com also states the Sabres won 8-5, with details about the game. Source [6] from NHL.com again confirms the Sabres' 8-5 victory, including quotes from players and coaches. Other sources like [3], [4], [5], [7], and [8] provide pre-game predictions and odds, but the post-game sources [1], [2], and [6] are definitive.\n\nThe key points are the date of the game (March 30) and the result (Sabres won 8-5). Since the event has occurred and the Sabres won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2 (\"Sabres\"). There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable. All sources confirming the Sabres' win are reliable, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Buffalo Sabres defeated the Washington Capitals 8-5 in their NHL game on March 30, 2025, at Capital One Arena[1][2][6]. Despite the Capitals scoring first, the Sabres responded with multiple goals, including two power-play goals from Tage Thompson and a pair of goals from Alex Tuch[1][2][6]. The game featured a high-scoring third period, with Washington narrowing the gap to 6-5 before Buffalo secured the win with late goals from Tuch and Peyton Krebs[1][6]. \n\nThis outcome meets the resolution criteria specified in the ancillary data, as the Sabres emerged victorious. The game was not postponed or canceled, and the result is verified through multiple post-game reports[1][2][6]. \n\nrecommendation: p2"

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies the event (Sabres vs. Capitals game on March 30, 2025) and confirms that it has occurred based on the current timestamp provided (March 31, 2025). The response uses multiple reliable sources to verify the outcome of the game, which is that the Sabres won 8-5. This outcome aligns perfectly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a Sabres win corresponds to a resolution of p2.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the steps needed to resolve the query. It checks the date to confirm the event has occurred, searches for reliable sources to verify the outcome, and matches the outcome with the resolution conditions specified in the ancillary data. The response is thorough in citing specific sources and details from the game, enhancing the credibility and completeness of the verification.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The event's outcome is verified through multiple sources, including a YouTube video and NHL.com reports, which are considered reliable. The recommendation to resolve the market to p2 (\"Sabres\") is directly aligned with the facts verified.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant pieces of missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the facts and the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information provided does not indicate any prices, showing uncertainty in market confidence. However, since the factual outcome of the game is confirmed (Sabres win), the market price does not impact the resolution recommendation in this case.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory as it meets all the required criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns with the verified outcome of the event, and there is no contradiction in the information provided.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event outcome using reliable sources and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data provided.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743454896 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 21:01:36 UTC",

The response strictly adheres to the facts and the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information provided does not indicate any prices, showing uncertainty in market confidence. However, since the factual outcome of the game is confirmed (Sabres win), the market price does not impact the resolution recommendation in this case.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory as it meets all the required criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns with the verified outcome of the event, and there is no contradiction in the information provided.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event outcome using reliable sources and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data provided.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743454896 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 21:01:36 UTC",
