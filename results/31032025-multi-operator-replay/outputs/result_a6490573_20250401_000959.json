The ancillary data specifies that if the Rangers win, it's p2 (\"Rangers\"), Sharks win p1 (\"Sharks\"), postponed stays open, canceled is 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and time. The query says March 29 at 10:30 PM ET. The current date provided is March 31, 2025, so the game is in the past. That means I don't have to worry about it being a future event. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources report the game's outcome. Source [1] states the Rangers won 6-1. The title mentions Panarin and Fox each scoring two goals. The detailed recap in [1] and [2] both confirm the score. Source [8], the ESPN game summary, also lists the final score as 6-1 in favor of the Rangers. Other sources like [4] and [6] (video titles and descriptions) back this up. \n\nI should check if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources discuss the game as having occurred, with detailed stats and recaps, so it wasn't postponed or canceled. The Sharks' loss is noted in [2] and [7], with Lund scoring their only goal. \n\nSince the Rangers won definitively, the resolution should be p2 according to the ancillary data. No conflicting information in the sources. All evidence points to a clear Rangers victory.\n</think>\n\nThe New York Rangers defeated the San Jose Sharks 6-1 in their NHL game on March 29, 2025. Artemi Panarin and Adam Fox each scored two goals, while Jonathan Quick made 21 saves for the Rangers[1][2][8]. The game was played as scheduled at SAP Center in San Jose, with no indications of postponement or cancellation[1][5][8].  \n\nKey details:  \n- **Final score**: Rangers 6, Sharks 1[1][8]  \n- **Game timeline**: Panarin scored twice in the first period (12:04 and 13:58), Fox added goals in the second (4:48) and third periods (5:47), with additional goals from Jonny Brodzinski and Vincent Trocheck[2][8].  \n- **Sharks' lone goal**: Rookie Cam Lund scored his first NHL goal on a power play at 17:46 of the third period[1][2].  \n\nThe Rangers dominated faceoffs (67.9% win rate) and outshot the Sharks 33-22[1][8]. This result moved New York into the Eastern Conference's second wild card spot[4].  \n\nrecommendation: p2"

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743458924 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 22:08:44 UTC",
