The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the MLB game between the Milwaukee Brewers and New York Yankees on March 30, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Yankees, p2 is Brewers, and p3 is 50-50 if the game is postponed, canceled, or suspended without completion. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The search results mention the game took place on March 30, 2025. Sources [1], [8], and [13] all confirm the Yankees won 12-3. The box score in [6] and [9] also show the final score as Yankees 12, Brewers 3. \n\nNext, I need to ensure the game wasn't postponed or suspended. All sources refer to the game being played and completed on March 30. There's no mention of delays or suspensions. The Brewers scored 3 runs, and the Yankees scored 12, so the game was official. \n\nSince the game was completed and the Yankees won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. All the sources align on the outcome, so there's no ambiguity. The answer is straightforward here.\n</think>\n\nThe New York Yankees defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 12-3 on March 30, 2025, in a game that concluded as scheduled without postponement, suspension, or cancellation[1][8][13]. The Yankees' victory was decisively confirmed by multiple sources, including official box scores and game recaps detailing the scoring progression and final outcome[6][8][9]. \n\nKey factors confirming resolution:\n- The game began and ended on March 30 with no evidence of incomplete play[1][6][8]\n- MLB officially recorded the Yankees as winners with a 12-3 final score[6][8]\n- No resolution-triggering contingencies (postponement, cancellation, or suspension) occurred[1][8]\n\nrecommendation: p1"

The response effectively verifies the occurrence of the MLB game between the Milwaukee Brewers and New York Yankees on March 30, 2025, and confirms the outcome based on multiple reliable sources. The response also correctly aligns with the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt, recommending a resolution of p1 (Yankees win) based on the verified outcome of the game.\n\nThe response demonstrates logical reasoning by checking for any conditions that might alter the resolution (such as postponement, cancellation, or suspension) and confirms none occurred. It also correctly identifies that the game was completed on the scheduled date and that the official MLB records corroborate the Yankees' victory.\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the instructions to rely on verified facts and established outcomes, and it does not speculate or infer beyond the available evidence.\n\nThe alignment with market price signals is not directly applicable here since the market prices are unknown, but the response's recommendation is based on solid evidence from multiple sources, which supports its reliability.\n\nGiven the thorough verification of facts, adherence to the user prompt's resolution conditions, and logical consistency in the response, there is no need for a rerun or revision of the response. The response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event outcome based on reliable sources, adheres to the resolution conditions, and logically addresses all required aspects of the user prompt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event's outcome and checks for any conditions that could alter the resolution.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743453199 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 20:33:19 UTC",
