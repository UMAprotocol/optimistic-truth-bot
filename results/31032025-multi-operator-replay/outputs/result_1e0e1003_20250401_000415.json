The Final Four is scheduled for April 5, so the Elite Eight results would determine who advances.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the outcome of the Auburn vs. Michigan State game.

Another source [13] from the State News confirms the same score and elimination. Additionally, the YouTube video [8] and [15] describe Auburn's victory and their advancement to the Final Four, while Michigan State is out. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that if the team is eliminated, the market resolves to \"No\" (p1). Since multiple credible sources confirm Michigan State's loss in the Elite Eight, they cannot advance to the Final Four. All four No. 1 seeds, including Auburn, are moving on as per [9] and [16]. \n\nNo conflicting information is present.

This loss prevented the Spartans from reaching their first Final Four since 2019[10][13].\n\nOfficial NCAA tournament brackets confirm Auburn advanced to the Final Four as the South Regional champion, joining three other No. 1 seeds (Duke, Florida, and Houston)[9][16].

The response correctly identifies that the event has already occurred and provides a detailed analysis based on reliable sources confirming Michigan State's elimination in the Elite Eight round.\n\nThe response is logically sound and complete, as it checks the current date, confirms the event's scheduling, and uses multiple sources to verify the outcome of the relevant game. The response also correctly aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which specifies that the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1) if Michigan State is eliminated, which they were.\n\nThere are no missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The response uses the correct sources as specified and does not deviate from the event in question. The recommendation of \"p1\" is well-supported by the evidence provided and aligns with the resolution conditions.\n\nThe market price information, although unknown, does not contradict the recommendation since the response is based on factual outcomes rather than market speculation. The response does not rely on market signals but strictly on the event's outcome, which is the correct approach for this type of query.\n\nGiven the accuracy, completeness, and strict adherence to the system prompt instructions, the response is satisfactory and does not require a rerun. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the verified facts and the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event based on reliable sources, adheres to the system prompt instructions, and correctly aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough and uses multiple sources to confirm the event outcome, ensuring a high level of accuracy and reliability.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743458563 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 22:02:43 UTC",
