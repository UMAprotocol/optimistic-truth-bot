The ancillary data specifies that \"Yes\" is p2 and \"No\" is p1. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The provided current date is March 31, 2025. The Final Four games are scheduled for April 5, 2025, according to search result [15]. Since the event date (Final Four) is in the future relative to the current date, my initial thought is to check if Auburn has already qualified. \n\nLooking through the search results, multiple sources confirm that Auburn defeated Michigan State in the Elite Eight on March 30, 2025, to advance to the Final Four. For example, result [1] states, \"Auburn joins Florida, Duke and Houston in the Final Four.\" Similarly, result [5] mentions, \"Auburn (32-5) earned its second Final Four trip...\" and result [13] from ESPN's recap also confirms Auburn's victory and advancement. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that if the team is eliminated, it resolves to \"No\". However, Auburn has already secured their spot in the Final Four by winning the Elite Eight game. Even though the Final Four hasn't occurred yet, the market resolution is based on whether they advanced, not on their performance in the Final Four itself. The description says the market resolves to \"Yes\" if the team advances, which they have. \n\nAdditionally, the user prompt's ancillary data specifies that the market resolves based on official NCAA information. The search results include official sources like ESPN, CBS Sports, and the NCAA's own website, all confirming Auburn's advancement. \n\nSince Auburn has already qualified for the Final Four and the event date (Final Four) is in the future but the qualification is determined, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2). There's no indication of any postponement or cancellation that would affect this outcome. All sources agree, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nAuburn defeated Michigan State 70-64 in the NCAA Tournament's Elite Eight round on March 30, 2025, securing their place in the 2025 Final Four alongside Florida, Duke, and Houston[1][5][13]. This marks Auburn's second Final Four appearance in program history and completes the first all-No. 1-seed Final Four since 2008[5][10]. The Tigers advanced as the South Region champions and will face Florida in the national semifinals on April 5, 2025[12][15]. \n\nGiven that Auburn has already qualified for the Final Four per official NCAA tournament results and the event date has not yet passed, the market resolves based on their confirmed advancement. \n\nrecommendation: p2"

        "response": "The perplexity response provided is generally accurate and adheres well to the instructions outlined in the system prompt. The response correctly identifies that the event in question (Auburn's participation in the 2025 Final Four) is scheduled for a future date relative to the current timestamp and that Auburn has already qualified for this event by defeating Michigan State. This is in line with the user prompt's requirement for the market to resolve to \"Yes\" if Auburn advances to the Final Four, which they have.\n\nThe response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm Auburn's advancement, which satisfies the requirement for verification through reliable sources. The mention of specific details such as the score of the game and other teams in the Final Four adds to the credibility and completeness of the response.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the response could be improved:\n1. The response could better highlight the specific NCAA sources confirming Auburn's advancement, as the user prompt emphasizes reliance on official NCAA information for resolution.\n2. The response mentions market price information from Polymarket but does not integrate this data into the analysis. Since the market prices are unknown, this might not affect the current resolution but should be noted if market prices were available and indicated a different sentiment.\n\nDespite these minor areas for improvement, the response is factually accurate, logically sound, and aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt. The recommendation of p2 (Yes) is appropriate based on the information provided and the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies Auburn's qualification for the 2025 Final Four based on reliable sources and correctly aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"Future responses could enhance the emphasis on specific NCAA sources when these are critical for resolution.

        "response": "The perplexity response provided is generally accurate and adheres well to the instructions outlined in the system prompt. The response correctly identifies that the event in question (Auburn's participation in the 2025 Final Four) is scheduled for a future date relative to the current timestamp and that Auburn has already qualified for this event by defeating Michigan State. This is in line with the user prompt's requirement for the market to resolve to \"Yes\" if Auburn advances to the Final Four, which they have.\n\nThe response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm Auburn's advancement, which satisfies the requirement for verification through reliable sources. The mention of specific details such as the score of the game and other teams in the Final Four adds to the credibility and completeness of the response.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the response could be improved:\n1. The response could better highlight the specific NCAA sources confirming Auburn's advancement, as the user prompt emphasizes reliance on official NCAA information for resolution.\n2. The response mentions market price information from Polymarket but does not integrate this data into the analysis. Since the market prices are unknown, this might not affect the current resolution but should be noted if market prices were available and indicated a different sentiment.\n\nDespite these minor areas for improvement, the response is factually accurate, logically sound, and aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt. The recommendation of p2 (Yes) is appropriate based on the information provided and the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies Auburn's qualification for the 2025 Final Four based on reliable sources and correctly aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"Future responses could enhance the emphasis on specific NCAA sources when these are critical for resolution. Integration of market price data could be improved when such data is relevant and available.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt.

If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
