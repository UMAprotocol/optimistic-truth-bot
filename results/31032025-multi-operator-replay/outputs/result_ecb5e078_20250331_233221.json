        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the market should resolve to \"Yes\" or \"No\" based on whether MicroStrategy buys 200+ Bitcoin in their next purchase between March 25 and April 30, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any announcements from MicroStrategy or Michael Saylor regarding Bitcoin purchases in that timeframe. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the period in question is from March 25 to April 30. \n\nLooking at the search results, the most recent purchase mentioned is in result [10], where MicroStrategy acquired 22,048 Bitcoins between March 24 and March 30, 2025. That's a purchase of over 200 BTC, but the dates are March 24-30. The market's start date is March 25, so the purchase on March 24 is before the window. However, the purchase period in result [10] extends to March 30, which is within the window. Wait, March 30 is within the March 25 to April 30 period. So that purchase of 22,048 BTC was made between March 24 and March 30. Since part of that period (March 25-30) is within the market's timeframe, does that count?\n\nThe market specifies that the purchase must be announced between March 25 and April 30. The purchase in result [10] was announced on March 31, 2025 (the current date in the prompt). The announcement date is within the resolution period. Therefore, this purchase of 22,048 BTC would qualify as the \"next purchase\" after March 25. \n\nAdditionally, result [11] mentions a purchase of 6,911 BTC between March 17 and March 23, 2025, which is before the window. Result [13] also refers to a purchase ending on March 23, which is outside the window. \n\nSince the only purchase within the specified timeframe is the 22,048 BTC announced on March 31, which is after March 25, this meets the condition of 200+ BTC. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2). \n\nI need to confirm that the resolution source is official, which it is, as the information comes from MicroStrategy's announcement. There's no indication of another purchase after March 30 but before April 30, but the question is about the next purchase after March 25. Since the next purchase was within the window and over 200 BTC, the answer is yes.\n</think>\n\nMicroStrategy's next Bitcoin purchase after March 25, 2025, occurred between March 24-30, 2025, with the company acquiring **22,048 BTC** as officially reported on March 31, 2025[10]. This purchase exceeds the 200 BTC threshold specified in the resolution conditions. Since the announcement date (March 31) falls within the March 25\u2013April 30 window and the purchase period partially overlaps with the resolution timeframe, the market resolves to **Yes**.\n\nrecommendation: p2"

The response effectively analyzes the event in question, which is whether MicroStrategy purchased 200 or more Bitcoins between March 25 and April 30, 2025. The response correctly identifies that the purchase of 22,048 Bitcoins, which was announced on March 31, 2025, falls within the specified timeframe and exceeds the threshold of 200 Bitcoins, thus meeting the conditions for a \"Yes\" resolution.\n\nThe response is logically sound and complete, as it considers all relevant purchases mentioned in the results and correctly identifies the one that meets the resolution conditions. The response also correctly disregards purchases outside the specified timeframe, such as the purchase of 6,911 Bitcoins before March 25.\n\nThe verification of the event and alignment of the recommendation with the facts are properly executed. The response confirms that the source of the information is official, coming from MicroStrategy's announcement, which is a requirement of the resolution conditions.\n\nThere are no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The response strictly adheres to the user prompt's instructions and the ancillary data provided, ensuring that the resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided.\n\nThe market price information from Polymarket is not directly relevant to the factual resolution of the event but serves as an indicator of market sentiment. Since the market prices for both \"Yes\" and \"No\" tokens are unknown, they do not influence the evaluation of the response.\n\nGiven the thoroughness and accuracy of the response, and its adherence to the system prompt instructions, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolves the query based on the specified conditions and verified facts.

        "response": "The perplexity response provided by the system appears to be accurate and adheres closely to the instructions outlined in the system prompt. The response effectively analyzes the event in question, which is whether MicroStrategy purchased 200 or more Bitcoins between March 25 and April 30, 2025. The response correctly identifies that the purchase of 22,048 Bitcoins, which was announced on March 31, 2025, falls within the specified timeframe and exceeds the threshold of 200 Bitcoins, thus meeting the conditions for a \"Yes\" resolution.\n\nThe response is logically sound and complete, as it considers all relevant purchases mentioned in the results and correctly identifies the one that meets the resolution conditions. The response also correctly disregards purchases outside the specified timeframe, such as the purchase of 6,911 Bitcoins before March 25.\n\nThe verification of the event and alignment of the recommendation with the facts are properly executed. The response confirms that the source of the information is official, coming from MicroStrategy's announcement, which is a requirement of the resolution conditions.\n\nThere are no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The response strictly adheres to the user prompt's instructions and the ancillary data provided, ensuring that the resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided.\n\nThe market price information from Polymarket is not directly relevant to the factual resolution of the event but serves as an indicator of market sentiment. Since the market prices for both \"Yes\" and \"No\" tokens are unknown, they do not influence the evaluation of the response.\n\nGiven the thoroughness and accuracy of the response, and its adherence to the system prompt instructions, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolves the query based on the specified conditions and verified facts. It adheres closely to the system prompt instructions and effectively uses the provided ancillary data.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured and logically sound, with a clear verification of facts and alignment with the resolution conditions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date.
