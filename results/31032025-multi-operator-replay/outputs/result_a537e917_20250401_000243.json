        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Congress will grant Trump more funds for deportations by June 30, 2025. The resolution depends on whether a bill with new or increased funding passes both the House and Senate by that date. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 31, 2025. The deadline is June 30, so there's still time. But looking at the search results, there's a lot of recent activity. \n\nSearch result [1] mentions that on March 14, 2025, Congress passed a continuing resolution (CR) that includes at least $430 million more for ICE. That's a significant increase. Then, [5] and [9] also talk about the CR passed in March, with [5] specifying $485 million for ICE. The CR was approved by both the House and Senate, as per [9], which says the House passed it on March 14 and the Senate on March 14 as well. \n\nThe Laken Riley Act is mentioned in [2], [8], and [15]. It targets deportations for nonviolent crimes and passed the House and Senate. However, the key here is whether it includes funding. The Laken Riley Act itself, according to [8], doesn't have new funding, but the CR does. \n\nThe CR in [9] is a full-year funding bill through September 2025, which includes increased funding for immigration enforcement. Since the CR was passed by both chambers and signed into law, that meets the condition of the market resolution. The user's query specifies that the bill must be passed by June 30, and the CR was passed in March, well before the deadline. \n\nThere's also mention in [7] and [12] about budget proposals for massive increases in immigration enforcement funding, but the CR already passed with actual increases. So even though there are ongoing budget discussions, the CR's passage with increased funds for deportations seems to fulfill the \"Yes\" condition. \n\nI need to confirm that the CR is a bill that explicitly includes new funding. From [1], [5], and [9], it's clear that the CR does include such funding. Therefore, the answer should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nCongress passed a continuing resolution (CR) on March 14, 2025, that explicitly allocates **$430 million to $485 million in new funding** for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to expand detention capacity, transportation, and deportations[1][5][9]. This bill cleared both the House (217-213) and Senate (54-46) before being signed into law, meeting the resolution criteria of congressional approval by June 30, 2025.\n\nKey evidence includes:\n- **$485 million ICE funding boost** in the CR for detention beds/operations[5]\n- **$136 million DOJ allocation** to handle increased immigration cases[1]\n- **Record deportation pace** with 32,809 arrests Jan 20-Mar 10 vs 33,242 in all of FY2024[5]\n- **Senate budget resolutions** proposing $175B-$350B for enforcement[7][12]\n\nWhile additional immigration bills like the Laken Riley Act passed Congress[2][8][15], the CR's explicit funding increases for deportation operations alone satisfy the resolution conditions. No contradictory evidence suggests these allocations were rejected or reduced before implementation.\n\nrecommendation: p2"

The response effectively analyzes the factual information regarding the passage of a continuing resolution (CR) that includes funding for deportations, which is the specific event in question as per the user prompt.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (passage of a CR including funding for deportations) has occurred before the specified deadline of June 30, 2025. The details about the CR, including the amount of funding and the dates of passage by the House and Senate, are consistent with the requirement to verify events based on concrete evidence. The response also adheres to the instruction to report only on events that have already occurred and can be verified through reliable sources.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically connects the passage of the CR with the resolution condition that a bill including new or increased funding for deportations must be passed by both the House and Senate by the specified date. It provides a detailed analysis of the funding amounts and the legislative process, ensuring that the reasoning is complete and well-supported by evidence.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the occurrence of the event (passage of the CR) and aligns the recommendation (p2) with the facts presented. The CR explicitly includes new funding for deportations, meeting the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The response focuses strictly on the event in question and uses multiple sources to corroborate the details of the CR and its implications for funding deportations.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information is not available (prices are unknown), so it does not provide additional guidance for evaluating the correctness of the response. However, the response itself is strong enough based on the evidence provided.\n\nGiven the thorough analysis and adherence to the guidelines, the response is satisfactory and does not require improvement. The recommendation of p2 is well-supported by the evidence and aligns with the resolution conditions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately and completely addresses the user prompt, verifying the event and providing a well-supported recommendation based on concrete evidence.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the details of the CR and its relevance to the resolution conditions, adhering closely to the instructions for factual accuracy and completeness.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```"

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743458470 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 22:01:10 UTC",

        "response": "The perplexity response provided by the system appears to be accurate, complete, and adheres to the instructions outlined in the system prompt. The response effectively analyzes the factual information regarding the passage of a continuing resolution (CR) that includes funding for deportations, which is the specific event in question as per the user prompt.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (passage of a CR including funding for deportations) has occurred before the specified deadline of June 30, 2025. The details about the CR, including the amount of funding and the dates of passage by the House and Senate, are consistent with the requirement to verify events based on concrete evidence. The response also adheres to the instruction to report only on events that have already occurred and can be verified through reliable sources.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically connects the passage of the CR with the resolution condition that a bill including new or increased funding for deportations must be passed by both the House and Senate by the specified date. It provides a detailed analysis of the funding amounts and the legislative process, ensuring that the reasoning is complete and well-supported by evidence.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the occurrence of the event (passage of the CR) and aligns the recommendation (p2) with the facts presented. The CR explicitly includes new funding for deportations, meeting the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The response focuses strictly on the event in question and uses multiple sources to corroborate the details of the CR and its implications for funding deportations.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information is not available (prices are unknown), so it does not provide additional guidance for evaluating the correctness of the response. However, the response itself is strong enough based on the evidence provided.\n\nGiven the thorough analysis and adherence to the guidelines, the response is satisfactory and does not require improvement. The recommendation of p2 is well-supported by the evidence and aligns with the resolution conditions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately and completely addresses the user prompt, verifying the event and providing a well-supported recommendation based on concrete evidence.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the details of the CR and its relevance to the resolution conditions, adhering closely to the instructions for factual accuracy and completeness.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743458470 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 22:01:10 UTC",
