This outcome aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a Maple Leafs win corresponds to a resolution of p2. The response does not predict future outcomes but rather reports on an event that has already occurred, adhering to the system's requirement to base resolutions on verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response methodically checks the outcome of the game and verifies it with several sources, including the Ducks' official site, which adds credibility to the information. The response also correctly notes that there was no postponement or cancellation of the game, which matches the conditions outlined for resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through multiple sources and aligns the recommendation (p2) with the factual outcome of the game as specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The response strictly adheres to the information provided in the user prompt and uses reliable sources for verification.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information provided does not indicate any prices, so it does not influence the evaluation of the response. The response's recommendation is based solely on the factual outcome of the game.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory as it meets all the required criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality.

        "response": "The perplexity response provided for the UMA optimistic oracle system regarding the NHL game between the Maple Leafs and the Ducks on March 30, 2025, appears to be accurate, complete, and adheres to the system prompt instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies the outcome of the game based on multiple reliable sources, confirming that the Maple Leafs won 3-2. This outcome aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a Maple Leafs win corresponds to a resolution of p2. The response does not predict future outcomes but rather reports on an event that has already occurred, adhering to the system's requirement to base resolutions on verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response methodically checks the outcome of the game and verifies it with several sources, including the Ducks' official site, which adds credibility to the information. The response also correctly notes that there was no postponement or cancellation of the game, which matches the conditions outlined for resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through multiple sources and aligns the recommendation (p2) with the factual outcome of the game as specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The response strictly adheres to the information provided in the user prompt and uses reliable sources for verification.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information provided does not indicate any prices, so it does not influence the evaluation of the response. The response's recommendation is based solely on the factual outcome of the game.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory as it meets all the required criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. There is no need for a rerun or default to p4, as the response successfully resolves the query based on the specified conditions and verified information.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately reports the outcome of the NHL game based on verified sources, aligns with the ancillary data for resolution, and adheres to the system prompt instructions without any errors or missing information.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple reliable sources to confirm the game's outcome and provides a clear, well-reasoned recommendation based on the event specifics and resolution conditions.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.).

If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
