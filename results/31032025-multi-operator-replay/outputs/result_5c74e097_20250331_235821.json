The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the MLB game between the Cleveland Guardians and Kansas City Royals on March 30, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Royals, p2 is Guardians, and p3 is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred on the scheduled date. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the game was yesterday. The search results include multiple sources confirming the game took place. For example, the YouTube highlights from March 30 [3][6][9] show the Guardians won 6-2. The box score from Fox Sports [8][15] also lists the Guardians as the winning team with a score of 6-2. Additionally, FanDuel's article [10] mentions Tanner Bibee earned the win for the Guardians in that game.\n\nNext, I need to ensure there's no indication the game was postponed or suspended. All sources refer to the game happening on March 30 without mentioning any delays or cancellations. The detailed play-by-play in the YouTube videos and the box score confirm the game was completed officially. \n\nSince the game was played and completed as scheduled, and the Guardians won, the resolution should be p2 according to the ancillary data. There's no conflicting information in the sources, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Cleveland Guardians defeated the Kansas City Royals 6-2 in their March 30, 2025 MLB game at Kauffman Stadium, as verified by multiple sources including official box scores and game highlights[3][8][10][15]. The game was played to completion without postponement or suspension, with starting pitcher Tanner Bibee earning the win for Cleveland[10]. \n\n**Key details confirming resolution:**\n- Final score: Guardians 6, Royals 2[8][15]\n- Game completed March 30 with no suspensions or cancellations[3][6][9]\n- Official MLB outcome recorded[10][15]\n\nrecommendation: p2"

        "response": "The perplexity response provided for the UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the MLB game between the Cleveland Guardians and the Kansas City Royals on March 30, 2025, appears to be accurate and complete based on the information provided. The response adheres to the system prompt instructions by verifying the occurrence and outcome of the event through multiple reliable sources, and it aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies the winner of the game as the Cleveland Guardians, with a final score of 6-2. It confirms that the game was completed on the scheduled date without any postponements or suspensions, which matches the conditions outlined in the user prompt for resolving the market as p2.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first verifying the occurrence of the event, then confirming the outcome, and finally checking for any conditions that might alter the typical resolution (such as postponements or incomplete games). The use of multiple sources to confirm the details adds robustness to the resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The event's verification is thorough, utilizing sources like YouTube highlights and Fox Sports box scores. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the ancillary data where p2 corresponds to a Guardians win.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors or biases in the response. All necessary information to resolve the query is included, and the response is free from any irrelevant or extraneous details.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information indicates uncertainty (Guardians: 0.000, Royals: 0.000), which suggests that there was no strong market sentiment prior to the resolution. However, this does not affect the factual outcome of the game, which is clearly resolved in favor of the Guardians.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory and meets the high standards required for accuracy and reliability in resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests. There is no need for a rerun as the response is factually correct, complete, and adheres strictly to the prompt instructions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately and completely resolves the query based on verified facts and aligns with the ancillary data.

        "response": "The perplexity response provided for the UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the MLB game between the Cleveland Guardians and the Kansas City Royals on March 30, 2025, appears to be accurate and complete based on the information provided. The response adheres to the system prompt instructions by verifying the occurrence and outcome of the event through multiple reliable sources, and it aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies the winner of the game as the Cleveland Guardians, with a final score of 6-2. It confirms that the game was completed on the scheduled date without any postponements or suspensions, which matches the conditions outlined in the user prompt for resolving the market as p2.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first verifying the occurrence of the event, then confirming the outcome, and finally checking for any conditions that might alter the typical resolution (such as postponements or incomplete games). The use of multiple sources to confirm the details adds robustness to the resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The event's verification is thorough, utilizing sources like YouTube highlights and Fox Sports box scores. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the ancillary data where p2 corresponds to a Guardians win.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors or biases in the response. All necessary information to resolve the query is included, and the response is free from any irrelevant or extraneous details.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information indicates uncertainty (Guardians: 0.000, Royals: 0.000), which suggests that there was no strong market sentiment prior to the resolution. However, this does not affect the factual outcome of the game, which is clearly resolved in favor of the Guardians.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory and meets the high standards required for accuracy and reliability in resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests. There is no need for a rerun as the response is factually correct, complete, and adheres strictly to the prompt instructions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately and completely resolves the query based on verified facts and aligns with the ancillary data.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt.

If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
