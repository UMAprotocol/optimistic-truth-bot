The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Delhi Capitals (DC) vs Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) IPL match scheduled for March 30, 2025, at 6:00 AM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if DC wins, the resolution is \"Delhi\" (p2), if SRH wins, it's \"Hyderabad\" (p1), and if the game isn't completed by April 5, 2025, it's a 50-50 split (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The provided current date is March 31, 2025, 8:32 PM UTC, which is after the match date. So the event has already occurred. Now, I need to verify the match result using the search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [3], [4], [6], [7]) report that Delhi Capitals defeated Sunrisers Hyderabad by 7 wickets. For example, source [1] states \"Delhi Capitals beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by 7 wickets\" and source [4] mentions \"Delhi Capitals (DC) jumped into the top 2... with a comfortable seven-wicket victory.\" The match was completed on March 30, as per the dates in the search results, well before the April 5 deadline. \n\nThere's no mention of the match being postponed or canceled. All sources confirm the result, so the game was completed. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, since DC won, the market should resolve to \"Delhi\" (p2). \n\nI also need to ensure that the event in the search results is the same as the one in the query. The match details (teams, date, tournament) align perfectly. No conflicting information is present. All sources consistently report DC's victory. \n\nThus, the correct recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nDelhi Capitals defeated Sunrisers Hyderabad by 7 wickets in their IPL 2025 match on March 30, 2025, at the Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium in Visakhapatnam[1][3][4][6]. The game concluded with DC chasing down SRH's total of 163 in just 16 overs, securing victory with four overs to spare[1][4]. As the match was completed on its scheduled date and Delhi Capitals won decisively, the market resolves to **\"Delhi\"** per the defined conditions. \n\nrecommendation: p2"

It correctly notes that the event has already occurred relative to the current timestamp. The response uses multiple sources to verify the outcome of the match, which is that Delhi Capitals won by 7 wickets. This outcome aligns with the resolution condition specified in the user prompt (p2 for a Delhi win).\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the user prompt and the verified sources.

The reasoning is clear, and the response is thorough in ensuring that the event details match the user prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the details match those specified in the user prompt.

The response strictly adheres to the facts and aligns with the system prompt's requirements for resolution based on verified outcomes.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information indicates uncertainty (both tokens priced at 0.000), which does not provide a strong market signal either way. Therefore, the market prices do not contradict the solver's recommendation based on factual outcomes.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, logical reasoning, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns with the verified outcome of the event, and there is no conflicting information from the market prices.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event outcome and aligns with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743453091 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 20:31:31 UTC",
