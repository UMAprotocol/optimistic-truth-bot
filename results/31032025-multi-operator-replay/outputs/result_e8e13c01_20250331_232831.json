        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of the Boston Red Sox vs. Texas Rangers game on March 30, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Rangers, p2 is Red Sox, and p3 is 50-50 if the game is postponed, canceled, or not completed by April 1. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the game date (March 30) is in the past. Now, looking at the search results:\n\nSearch result [1] from Fox Sports shows the final score as Red Sox 1-2 Rangers. That's a direct indication that the Rangers won. However, the date on this result is March 30, which matches the game date. \n\nSearch result [6] from CBS Sports details a game on March 29 where the Rangers won 4-3. But that's a different date, so not relevant here. \n\nSearch result [4] is a condensed game video from MLB.com dated March 30, mentioning Adolis Garc\u00eda and Wyatt Langford, which suggests the game took place. \n\nSearch result [7] and [8] from MLB.com also reference the March 30 game, with Jacob deGrom starting for the Rangers. \n\nThe key confirmation comes from [1], which explicitly states the final score as Rangers 2-1 over the Red Sox on March 30. There's no mention of the game being postponed, suspended, or canceled. All other sources either discuss previous games or previews but don't contradict the March 30 result. \n\nSince the game was completed on March 30 with the Rangers winning 2-1, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (Rangers). There's no indication of any delays or suspensions that would trigger a 50-50 resolution. All sources confirm the game was played and concluded as scheduled.\n</think>\n\nThe Boston Red Sox and Texas Rangers played their scheduled MLB game on March 30, 2025, at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas. According to the official final score reported by FOX Sports, the **Texas Rangers defeated the Boston Red Sox 2-1**[1]. This outcome aligns with the resolution conditions provided, as the game was completed on its scheduled date without postponement, suspension, or cancellation. \n\nKey details confirming the result:\n- The Rangers' Jacob deGrom started the game, marking his first MLB outing of at least 5 innings since April 2023[5].\n- No sources indicate the game was interrupted, suspended, or declared a tie.\n- The MLB.com condensed game footage from March 30 further corroborates the game's completion[4][7].\n\nSince the Rangers won per the official MLB outcome, the market resolves to **p1** as defined in the ancillary data. \n\nrecommendation: p1"

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743456398 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 21:26:38 UTC",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743456398 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 21:26:38 UTC",

The response effectively verifies the occurrence of the event, the Boston Red Sox vs. Texas Rangers game on March 30, 2025, and provides a detailed analysis based on multiple sources confirming the outcome of the game. The response aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which specifies the resolution conditions for different outcomes of the game.\n\nThe response demonstrates a thorough search and verification process, citing multiple sources to confirm that the game was completed as scheduled and that the Texas Rangers won. This outcome aligns with the resolution condition p1 (Rangers win), as specified in the ancillary data. The response also correctly identifies that there were no interruptions, suspensions, or cancellations that would trigger a different resolution condition.\n\nThe response does not show any significant bias or errors. It strictly adheres to the facts and conditions outlined in the user prompt and uses verified sources to support its conclusions. The logical reasoning is sound, and the response is complete in addressing all relevant aspects of the user prompt.\n\nRegarding the market price information, the response does not conflict with the market signals, as the market prices are unknown and do not provide a clear indication of market sentiment. Therefore, there is no contradiction between the solver's recommendation and the market signals.\n\nBased on the evaluation, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently. There is no need for a rerun, and the response meets the high standards required for accuracy and reliability in resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event outcome based on multiple reliable sources and aligns with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.
