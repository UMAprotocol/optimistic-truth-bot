        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of the Pittsburgh Pirates vs. Miami Marlins game on March 30, 2025. The ancillary data specifies how the market should resolve under different scenarios. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's status and result. The search results include several recaps and box scores. Looking at result [9] and [13], both mention the game on March 30 ended with a Marlins walk-off win. Specifically, [13] states the Marlins won 3-2 with Derek Hill scoring on a wild pitch in the ninth inning. The ESPN recap in [9] also confirms the Marlins' victory. \n\nNext, I need to check if the game was completed or suspended. The detailed box score in [3] is from March 28, so that's a different game. The March 30 game is covered in [9] and [13], which describe a full game ending in the ninth inning with no mention of suspension or postponement. The MLB rules in [6] and [7] state that a regulation game is official after 5 innings. Since the game went the full 9 innings and ended with a Marlins win, it's considered completed. \n\nThe ancillary data says if the game is completed, resolve based on the official outcome. Since the Marlins won, the resolution should be p1. There's no indication of the game being suspended or postponed, so the 50-50 scenario doesn't apply. All sources point to a completed game with a Marlins victory, so the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates vs. Miami Marlins game on March 30, 2025, was completed as a regulation game with the Marlins winning 3-2 via a walk-off wild pitch in the ninth inning[9][13]. According to MLB rules, the game became official after five innings[6], and no suspensions or postponements were reported[9][13]. The official outcome recorded by MLB shows the Marlins as the winner, meeting the market's resolution condition for **p1** (Marlins win). \n\nrecommendation: p1"

        "response": "The perplexity response provided for the UMA optimistic oracle system regarding the outcome of the Pittsburgh Pirates vs. Miami Marlins game on March 30, 2025, appears to be accurate and complete based on the information provided. The response adheres to the system prompt instructions by verifying the event's occurrence and outcome through reliable sources, and it aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the outcome of the game, with the Marlins winning against the Pirates. It verifies this outcome through multiple sources (cited as [9] and [13]), ensuring that the game was completed and not suspended or postponed. The response adheres to the instructions by focusing solely on verified facts and the specific event in question.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the conditions outlined in the user prompt for different scenarios (completed game, suspension, postponement, official outcome) and confirms that the game met the conditions for a Marlins win (p1). The reasoning is thorough and considers all necessary aspects to ensure the correct resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence on the specified date and checks for any issues that might affect the resolution (like suspension or postponement). It aligns the recommendation (p1) directly with the verified outcome of the game, as per the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses on the necessary details and avoids extraneous information, maintaining objectivity and accuracy.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information provided does not indicate any prices, so it does not influence the resolution recommendation. The response correctly disregards this aspect since it does not provide actionable data.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory and meets the requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. There is no need for a rerun as the response adequately addresses all required aspects with appropriate verification and logical reasoning.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the specified event, aligns with the ancillary data, and adheres to the system prompt instructions without any significant errors or omissions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured and thorough, effectively using verified sources to confirm the event outcome and logically processing the conditions for resolution.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```"

        "response": "The perplexity response provided for the UMA optimistic oracle system regarding the outcome of the Pittsburgh Pirates vs. Miami Marlins game on March 30, 2025, appears to be accurate and complete based on the information provided. The response adheres to the system prompt instructions by verifying the event's occurrence and outcome through reliable sources, and it aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the outcome of the game, with the Marlins winning against the Pirates. It verifies this outcome through multiple sources (cited as [9] and [13]), ensuring that the game was completed and not suspended or postponed. The response adheres to the instructions by focusing solely on verified facts and the specific event in question.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the conditions outlined in the user prompt for different scenarios (completed game, suspension, postponement, official outcome) and confirms that the game met the conditions for a Marlins win (p1). The reasoning is thorough and considers all necessary aspects to ensure the correct resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence on the specified date and checks for any issues that might affect the resolution (like suspension or postponement). It aligns the recommendation (p1) directly with the verified outcome of the game, as per the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses on the necessary details and avoids extraneous information, maintaining objectivity and accuracy.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information provided does not indicate any prices, so it does not influence the resolution recommendation. The response correctly disregards this aspect since it does not provide actionable data.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory and meets the requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. There is no need for a rerun as the response adequately addresses all required aspects with appropriate verification and logical reasoning.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the specified event, aligns with the ancillary data, and adheres to the system prompt instructions without any significant errors or omissions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured and thorough, effectively using verified sources to confirm the event outcome and logically processing the conditions for resolution.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
