        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if MicroStrategy purchased Bitcoin between March 25 and March 31, 2025. The resolution depends on an official announcement from MicroStrategy or Michael Saylor during that period. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any announcements within the specified dates. Let's look through the provided sources. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's a key entry from March 31, 2025 (source [2] and [9]), where MicroStrategy announced purchasing 22,048 Bitcoins between March 24 and March 30. The announcement date is March 31, which falls within the user's timeframe (March 25-31). The purchase period is March 24-30, which is mostly within the date range except for March 24. However, the announcement itself was made on March 31, which is within the required window. \n\nAnother source [13] also mentions the same purchase on March 31, confirming the acquisition. The official filing with the SEC would count as an official source. Since the announcement was made within the specified dates, this should resolve to \"Yes\". \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. Other sources from March 23 and earlier (like [4], [7], [16]) discuss earlier purchases but don't cover the March 25-31 window. The March 31 announcement is the critical one here. \n\nTherefore, based on the official announcement on March 31, the answer should be \"Yes\", corresponding to p2.\n</think>\n\nMicroStrategy announced on March 31, 2025, that it acquired **22,048 Bitcoins** between March 24 and March 30, 2025, at an average price of $86,969 per Bitcoin, totaling $1.92 billion[2][9][13]. This purchase was disclosed in an SEC filing and via Michael Saylor\u2019s public communications, meeting the criteria for official sources specified in the resolution conditions. While the acquisition period began on March 24 (outside the March 25\u201331 window), the **announcement date (March 31)** falls within the resolution timeframe of March 25\u201331, 2025[2][9]. \n\nrecommendation: p2"

The response effectively analyzes the event in question, which is whether MicroStrategy purchased Bitcoin between March 25 and March 31, 2025, and uses verified facts from reliable sources to come to a resolution.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that MicroStrategy announced the purchase of Bitcoin on March 31, 2025, which falls within the specified timeframe of March 25-31, 2025. The announcement pertains to a purchase made between March 24 and March 30, 2025. Although the purchase started a day before the specified period, the announcement date is within the required timeframe, which aligns with the resolution conditions stated in the user prompt.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically deduces that since the announcement was made within the specified dates, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2). It checks for conflicting information and confirms the absence of any that would affect the resolution. The response also correctly identifies the sources of the announcement as being official, which meets the criteria for resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event using multiple sources and ensures that the announcement date and the details of the Bitcoin purchase match the user prompt's requirements. The recommendation to resolve as p2 is well-supported by the facts presented.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses strictly on the event specified in the user prompt and uses the correct sources for verification.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information indicates uncertainty (YES: 0.000, NO: 0.000), which suggests that there is no strong market sentiment either way. This does not conflict with the solver's recommendation, as the market does not provide a contrary indication.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743454507 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 20:55:07 UTC",

This does not conflict with the solver's recommendation, as the market does not provide a contrary indication.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation is based on verified facts and aligns with the conditions provided in the user prompt.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolves the query based on verified facts and adheres to the system prompt instructions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743454507 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 20:55:07 UTC",
