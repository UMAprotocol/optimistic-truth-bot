      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump will mention \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" between April 19 and April 25, 2025. The resolution depends on any audio or video recording where he says those words during that period. Written statements don't count, only verbal mentions.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The timestamp given is April 22, 2025, 11:38 PM UTC. The event window is from April 19 to April 25, so we're in the middle of that period. The user provided several search results, so I need to go through them to see if there are any mentions of Trump speaking during this time frame.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's a few key points. Result [3] mentions an agreement signed on April 22 between Trump Media, Crypto.com, and Yorkville America Digital for ETF launches. However, this is a written agreement, so it doesn't count. Result [14] and [17]-[19] discuss a phone call between Trump and Netanyahu on April 22. The content of the call was about trade and Iran, but there's no mention of \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" in those discussions. \n\nResult [7] mentions Trump speaking at the Digital Asset Summit on March 20, which is outside the event window. Similarly, result [11] from March 20 has Trump talking about crypto, but that's also before April 19. Result [5] from March 7 is a speech where he mentions crypto, but again, outside the required dates. \n\nResult [15] and [16] from April 22 discuss partnerships and market reactions but don't indicate any verbal mentions by Trump. The other results either don't fall within the date range or are written statements. \n\nSince the current date is April 22 and the event window is still open until April 25, there's a possibility Trump could mention the terms in the remaining days. However, based on the provided search results up to April 22, there's no evidence of a verbal mention. The user's ancillary data specifies that if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, we should return p4. But since the event is ongoing and hasn't concluded yet, but part of the period has passed without any mentions found, the resolution would depend on whether any future mentions occur. However, the instructions say if the event is scheduled for a future date or hasn't occurred yet, return p4. But in this case, the event is ongoing. The user's personalization says if the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome. Since part of the event window is in the past (April 19-22) and no mentions are found, but the window is still open until April 25, it's a bit tricky. However, the user's instruction says if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, return p4. Since the event is ongoing and not entirely in the past, but part of it is, but the current time is during the event window, the correct approach is to check if there's any mention so far. Since there's none, but the window isn't closed yet, the resolution would be p4. Wait, no. The user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" The current timestamp is April 22, 2025, 11:38 PM UTC. The event window is from April 19 to April 25. So part of the event is in the past (April 19-22) and part is future (April 23-25). Since the event is ongoing, but the user is asking for a resolution now, the system must determine based on available information up to now. If there's no mention in the past days (April 19-22), but the event is still ongoing, the correct resolution would be p4 because the event hasn't concluded. However, the user's personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" But the event is partially in the past and partially in the future. The key is whether the event has already started but not yet finished. In this case, since the event is ongoing, but the resolution depends on the entire period, and the current time is during the event window, the system should wait until the event concludes. However, the user is asking for a resolution now. The instructions say if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, return p4. But since part of the event is in the past, but not the entire event, it's unclear. However, the user's personalization says: \"If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.\" So if any part of the event is in the future, it's considered unresolved. Therefore, since the event window extends beyond the current timestamp (April 22, 11:38 PM UTC) until April 25, the event is still ongoing, and thus the resolution should be p4. However, the user's query is whether Trump will say the words during the entire week, including days that have already passed. Since the current date is April 22, and the event started on April 19, we need to check if there were any mentions from April 19 to April 22. The search results don't show any verbal mentions during that period. Therefore, if the event is partially in the past and no mentions are found, but the event is still ongoing, the resolution would depend on whether any future mentions occur. Since we can't predict the future, but the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if the event is in the past. However, the event is not entirely in the past. This is a bit conflicting. The correct approach here is to check if any part of the event has occurred and if there's any mention. Since the event started on April 19 and it's now April 22, and there's no evidence of a mention in the search results up to April 22, the resolution would be \"No\" (p1) if the event is considered to have already passed for the days up to now. But the event is still ongoing, so technically, it's not fully in the past. However, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" Since part of the event is in the past (April 19-22) and no mentions are found, but the event is still ongoing, the resolution would be p4 because the event hasn't concluded. However, the user's ancillary data defines p3 as 0.5 for unknown/50-50. But the personalization says to use p4 if the event is in the future. Wait, the resolution conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 0.5. The personalization says to return p4 if the event is scheduled for a future date or time. But p4 isn't part of the resolution conditions. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.\" The resolution conditions here are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 0.5. But the personalization says if the event is in the future, return p4. However, in the resolution_conditions provided, there's no p4. This is a conflict. The user's ancillary data defines p1, p2, p3, but the personalization mentions p4. This might be an error, but according to the user's instructions, we should follow the resolution_conditions as given. However, the personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. Since the event is ongoing (partially in the past, partially future), but the current time is during the event window, the correct recommendation would be p4, but the resolution_conditions don't include p4. This is a problem. Wait, looking back at the user's query, the resolution_conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 0.5. The personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. However, the event is ongoing, so part is past, part future. The personalization says: \"If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.\" So if any part of the event is in the future, it's considered unresolved. Therefore, since the event ends on April 25, which is after the current date of April 22, the event is still future, so the recommendation should be p4. However, the resolution_conditions don't have p4. This is a conflict. The user might have made a mistake in their setup. But according to the instructions, we must follow the personalization which says to return p4 if the event is in the future. Even though the resolution_conditions don't include p4, the personalization takes precedence. Therefore, the recommendation would be p4. But the resolution_conditions only have p1, p2, p3. This is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended p3 to be the \"unknown\" case. In that case, since the event is ongoing and hasn't concluded, the answer is p3. But the personalization says to return p4. This is a conflict. Given the ambiguity, but following the user's personalization strictly, since the event is not entirely in the past, the correct recommendation is p4. However, the resolution_conditions don't have p4, so perhaps the user made an error. Alternatively, maybe p3 is the correct choice here as the outcome is uncertain. But according to the personalization, if the event is in the future, return p4. Therefore, despite the resolution_conditions not including p4, the answer should be p4. However, the system might not allow p4 if it's not in the resolution_conditions. This is a tricky situation. Given the conflict, but following the user's personalization which mandates using p4 for future events, even if the resolution_conditions don't include it, the recommendation would be p4. However, the user's resolution_conditions only have p1, p2, p3. This suggests a possible error in the setup. But as an AI, I must follow the instructions given. Since the event is ongoing and part of it is in the future, per the personalization, the recommendation is p4. However, the resolution_conditions don't have p4, so this might be an error. Alternatively, the user might have intended p3 for such cases. Given the ambiguity, but strictly following the personalization, the answer is p4. But since the resolution_conditions don't include p4, perhaps the correct approach is to default to p3 (unknown/50-50). However, the personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. Therefore, despite the resolution_conditions, the answer should be p4. But the system might not allow that. This is a conflict. To resolve this, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the event is ongoing, and since part of it is in the future, we can't yet determine the outcome, hence p3. Alternatively, if the event has already started and there's no mention so far, but the window is still open, it's possible but not certain. Therefore, p3. However, the personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. Given the current timestamp is during the event window, the event is ongoing, so it's partially in the past and future. The personalization says if the event is scheduled for a future date or time, return p4. Since the event is ongoing, but not yet concluded, it's considered future, hence p4. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745364972 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-22 23:36:12 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump will mention \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" between April 19 and April 25, 2025. The resolution depends on any audio or video recording where he says those words during that period. Written statements don't count, only verbal mentions.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The timestamp given is April 22, 2025, 11:38 PM UTC. The event window is from April 19 to April 25, so we're in the middle of that period. The user provided several search results, so I need to go through them to see if there are any mentions of Trump speaking during this time frame.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's a few key points. Result [3] mentions an agreement signed on April 22 between Trump Media, Crypto.com, and Yorkville America Digital for ETF launches. However, this is a written agreement, so it doesn't count. Result [14] and [17]-[19] discuss a phone call between Trump and Netanyahu on April 22. The content of the call was about trade and Iran, but there's no mention of \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" in those discussions. \n\nResult [7] mentions Trump speaking at the Digital Asset Summit on March 20, which is outside the event window. Similarly, result [11] from March 20 has Trump talking about crypto, but that's also before April 19. Result [5] from March 7 is a speech where he mentions crypto, but again, outside the required dates. \n\nResult [15] and [16] from April 22 discuss partnerships and market reactions but don't indicate any verbal mentions by Trump. The other results either don't fall within the date range or are written statements. \n\nSince the current date is April 22 and the event window is still open until April 25, there's a possibility Trump could mention the terms in the remaining days. However, based on the provided search results up to April 22, there's no evidence of a verbal mention. The user's ancillary data specifies that if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, we should return p4. But since the event is ongoing and hasn't concluded yet, but part of the period has passed without any mentions found, the resolution would depend on whether any future mentions occur. However, the instructions say if the event is scheduled for a future date or hasn't occurred yet, return p4. But in this case, the event is ongoing. The user's personalization says if the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome. Since part of the event window is in the past (April 19-22) and no mentions are found, but the window is still open until April 25, it's a bit tricky. However, the user's instruction says if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, return p4. Since the event is ongoing and not entirely in the past, but part of it is, but the current time is during the event window, the correct approach is to check if there's any mention so far. Since there's none, but the window isn't closed yet, the resolution would be p4. Wait, no. The user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" The current timestamp is April 22, 2025, 11:38 PM UTC. The event window is from April 19 to April 25. So part of the event is in the past (April 19-22) and part is future (April 23-25). Since the event is ongoing, but the user is asking for a resolution now, the system must determine based on available information up to now. If there's no mention in the past days (April 19-22), but the event is still ongoing, the correct resolution would be p4 because the event hasn't concluded. However, the user's personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" But the event is partially in the past and partially in the future. The key is whether the event has already started but not yet finished. In this case, since the event is ongoing, but the resolution depends on the entire period, and the current time is during the event window, the system should wait until the event concludes. However, the user is asking for a resolution now. The instructions say if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, return p4. But since part of the event is in the past, but not the entire event, it's unclear. However, the user's personalization says: \"If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.\" So if any part of the event is in the future, it's considered unresolved. Therefore, since the event window extends beyond the current timestamp (April 22, 11:38 PM UTC) until April 25, the event is still ongoing, and thus the resolution should be p4. However, the user's query is whether Trump will say the words during the entire week, including days that have already passed. Since the current date is April 22, and the event started on April 19, we need to check if there were any mentions from April 19 to April 22. The search results don't show any verbal mentions during that period. Therefore, if the event is partially in the past and no mentions are found, but the event is still ongoing, the resolution would depend on whether any future mentions occur. Since we can't predict the future, but the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if the event is in the past. However, the event is not entirely in the past. This is a bit conflicting. The correct approach here is to check if any part of the event has occurred and if there's any mention. Since the event started on April 19 and it's now April 22, and there's no evidence of a mention in the search results up to April 22, the resolution would be \"No\" (p1) if the event is considered to have already passed for the days up to now. But the event is still ongoing, so technically, it's not fully in the past. However, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" Since part of the event is in the past (April 19-22) and no mentions are found, but the event is still ongoing, the resolution would be p4 because the event hasn't concluded. However, the user's ancillary data defines p3 as 0.5 for unknown/50-50. But the personalization says to use p4 if the event is in the future. Wait, the resolution conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 0.5. The personalization says to return p4 if the event is scheduled for a future date or time. But p4 isn't part of the resolution conditions. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.\" The resolution conditions here are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 0.5. But the personalization says if the event is in the future, return p4. However, in the resolution_conditions provided, there's no p4. This is a conflict. The user's ancillary data defines p1, p2, p3, but the personalization mentions p4. This might be an error, but according to the user's instructions, we should follow the resolution_conditions as given. However, the personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future.

Written statements don't count.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any events or speeches Trump had during that week. The current date is April 22, 2025, so the period in question is from April 19 to April 25. The search results include several events up to April 22, but I need to see if there's any mention in the specified timeframe.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's a mention of Trump speaking at the Blockworks Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025, where he talked about crypto and Bitcoin. However, that's outside the April 19-25 window. Another event on March 7 at the White House Digital Assets Summit where he mentioned Bitcoin, but again, that's too early.\n\nThere's a video from April 22, 2025, where Trump's criticism of the Fed Chair led to a Bitcoin price surge. The article mentions his remarks on April 20 about economic growth impacting crypto markets. However, the user's query is about verbal mentions of the specific terms \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" in the given week. The April 20 announcement's transcript isn't provided, so I can't confirm if he used those exact words.\n\nAnother search result from April 22 mentions Trump Media partnering with Crypto.com to launch ETFs, but that's a written business deal, not a verbal mention. The article about Bitcoin crossing $91k on April 22 references Trump's criticism of the Fed, but again, no direct quote of him saying \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin.\"\n\nThe key here is that the user's query requires a verbal mention in a recorded format. The latest event in the search results within the date range is the April 22 announcement, but without a transcript or video evidence showing Trump saying the exact words, I can't confirm. The provided search results don't include any videos or transcripts from April 19-25 where Trump explicitly says \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin.\" \n\nSince the user's previous response was p1 (No), they want a different approach. Maybe checking if any upcoming events were mentioned. The search results mention a crypto summit on March 7 and other past events, but nothing scheduled for April 19-25. Without new data within the timeframe, there's no evidence to support a \"Yes\" resolution. Therefore, the recommendation remains p1 (No) as there's no verifiable mention in the specified period.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.

The user wants to know if Donald Trump mentioned \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" between April 19 and April 25, 2025. The resolution depends on any verbal mentions in recorded audio or video that's publicly accessible. Written statements don't count.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any events or speeches Trump had during that week. The current date is April 22, 2025, so the period in question is from April 19 to April 25. The search results include several events up to April 22, but I need to see if there's any mention in the specified timeframe.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's a mention of Trump speaking at the Blockworks Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025, where he talked about crypto and Bitcoin. However, that's outside the April 19-25 window.

The provided search results don't include any videos or transcripts from April 19-25 where Trump explicitly says \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin.\" \n\nSince the user's previous response was p1 (No), they want a different approach. Maybe checking if any upcoming events were mentioned. The search results mention a crypto summit on March 7 and other past events, but nothing scheduled for April 19-25. Without new data within the timeframe, there's no evidence to support a \"Yes\" resolution.

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.994 = 99.4% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745364972 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-22 23:36:12 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p1. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please re-evaluate the available data sources or consider alternative approaches to align the recommendation with the strong market sentiment.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump mentioned \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" between April 19 and April 25, 2025. The resolution depends on any verbal mentions in recorded audio or video that's publicly accessible. Written statements don't count.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any events or mentions during that timeframe. The current date is April 22, 2025, so the window is from April 19 to April 25. Let's look through the search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, most of them are from March and early April. The latest one is [1] from April 22, which talks about the ECB and EU Commission's dispute over crypto regulations under Trump. However, this is a news article, not a direct mention by Trump. \n\nResult [8] is from April 9, where Trump announced a tariff pause, leading to a Bitcoin price surge. But that's before the April 19 window. \n\nResult [16] mentions a speech on April 14, 2025, where Trump talked about making the U.S. the \"Crypto Capital of the World\" and announced a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. However, April 14 is outside the specified window (April 19-25). \n\nResult [19] from April 19 discusses Trump's memecoin surge but doesn't mention him speaking about crypto or Bitcoin during the relevant period. \n\nOther results like [3], [11], and [13] are from March and early April, so they don't fall within the April 19-25 window. \n\nThere's no mention in the search results of Trump making any verbal statements between April 19 and 25 that include \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin.\" The latest event mentioned is the April 14 speech, which is before the window. \n\nSince there's no evidence in the provided sources of Trump mentioning those terms within the specified dates, the resolution should be \"No.\" However, the user's additional instructions mention re-evaluating with a different approach. Maybe check if any upcoming events were planned. The search results don't indicate any scheduled speeches or events between April 19-25. \n\nAlso, considering the current date is April 22, and the window is still open until April 25, but the latest search result is from April 22, which doesn't report any new mentions. Without any data indicating a mention, the safe conclusion is that there's no verified verbal mention during the period. Therefore, the recommendation is p1 (No).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.994, ID: 18105752369715878062080183403521824191135803949667648234240161972283581524597, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.006, ID: 56489166600023942692236137359923164616987680690168539044195662517438523594610, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.994 = 99.4% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Therefore, the answer is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.994, ID: 18105752369715878062080183403521824191135803949667648234240161972283581524597, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.006, ID: 56489166600023942692236137359923164616987680690168539044195662517438523594610, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3.

The current date is April 22, 2025. The search results include events up to April 21, like the Easter Egg Roll on April 21 [18], but the transcript there doesn't mention crypto or Bitcoin. There's also a tariff speech on April 2 and 3 [9][10][11], which didn't mention crypto, leading to a price drop [13][14]. \n\nLooking at the events after April 19, the Easter Egg Roll on April 21 is the only one in the provided data. The transcript from that event doesn't include any mentions of crypto or Bitcoin. There's an upcoming event on April 24 about U.S.-Taiwan relations [16], but that's outside the crypto context. \n\nThe user also provided a memo about a crypto summit on March 7 [12] and Trump's speeches in March about crypto [3][6][7][8][17], but those are before April 19. The latest relevant event is the Easter speech, which didn't mention the terms. \n\nSince there's no mention in the available data post-April 19, and the next event is on April 24 (which isn't about crypto), it's likely he didn't mention the terms. However, the user wants a re-evaluation. Maybe there's a hidden mention? The search results don't show any. The TRUMP memecoin surge on April 19 [15] isn't a direct mention by Trump. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided data up to April 22, there's no evidence of Trump mentioning \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" in the specified timeframe.

The resolution depends on any verbal mentions in recorded audio or video that's publicly accessible. Written statements don't count.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any events or mentions during that timeframe. The current date is April 22, 2025, so the period in question is from three days ago up to three days from now. The search results go up to April 22, so I can only look at up to that date.\n\nLooking at the search results, most recent ones are from April 22. Let's go through them:\n\nResult [9] from April 22 mentions Trump Media partnering with Crypto.com for an ETF launch. But this is a written agreement, not a verbal mention. So it doesn't count.\n\nResult [14] also from April 22 talks about Trump Media sealing a deal with Crypto.com. Again, a written announcement, not a verbal statement.\n\nResult [13] from April 19 mentions Bitcoin's price stability during protests but doesn't indicate Trump made any verbal mentions.\n\nResult [6] from April 9 discusses Bitcoin's price surge due to Trump's tariff pause. But that's before April 19, so outside the window.\n\nResults [1], [2], [3], [4], [7], [8], [12], [15], [17], [18], [19], [20] are all from March or earlier. They show Trump's past involvement with crypto, like the crypto summit, executive orders, and strategic reserves. But these are all outside the April 19-25 window.\n\nResult [11] is a video from April 3 where Trump talks about economic policies and tariffs. The transcript provided doesn't mention crypto or Bitcoin. He focuses on trade and industry, not digital assets.\n\nResult [10] from March 30 discusses upcoming tariffs on April 2, which is before the period in question. No mentions there.\n\nResult [5] from April 11 is about the TRUMP coin price prediction, not verbal mentions by Trump.\n\nResult [16] from January 21 mentions Trump's past support but no recent activity.\n\nSo, based on the provided search results up to April 22, there's no evidence of Trump verbally mentioning \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" between April 19 and April 22. The user's query period extends to April 25, but since the current data only goes up to April 22, we can't confirm any mentions after that. However, the user's additional instructions mention re-evaluating for unrecorded mentions. The search results don't indicate any such events. \n\nThe market sentiment for \"Yes\" might be due to anticipation from recent partnerships (like the ETF launch) or past behavior, but according to the resolution conditions, only actual verbal mentions within the timeframe count. Without evidence of such mentions, the recommendation should be \"No\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Your task is to analyze the provided query and decide which AI solver is best suited to handle it.\n\nAvailable solvers: code_runner\n\nSolver descriptions:\n- perplexity: Uses the Perplexity AI search engine to find information online to answer general questions. Best for:\n  * Historical data and events\n  * General knowledge questions requiring context\n  * Questions needing interpretation of complex information\n  * Has knowledge cutoff and may not have very recent information\n\n- code_runner: Executes code to fetch real-time data from specific APIs. Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Available Crypto Data Sources:\n    - Binance: Provides cryptocurrency price data for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies\n  * Available Sports Data Sources:\n    - Sports Data IO - MLB (baseball): MLB baseball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NBA (basketball): NBA basketball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NFL (football): NFL football scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NHL (hockey): NHL hockey scores, statistics, and game data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Will Trump say \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" this week?, description: This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Donald Trump mentions the listed term between April 19, 00:00 AM ET and April 25, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nPluralization/possessive of the word will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nInstances where the term is used in a compound word will count regardless of context (e.g. joyful is not a compound word for \"joy,\" however \"killjoy\" is a compounding of the words \"kill\" and \"joy\").\n\nA \u00e2\u0080\u0098mention' will include any verbal mention which is recorded (audio or video) and publicly accessible.\n\nWritten usages of terms (e.g. Truth Social posts, written statements, etc.) will not count toward this market's resolution.\n\nVideos posted on his social media which were filmed outside this market's time frame will not qualify for a \"Yes\" resolution.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe perplexity solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: perplexity\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",
