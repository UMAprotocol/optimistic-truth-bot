      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"President\" 60 or more times during her next White House press briefing. The resolution depends on the exact count of the term \"President\" in her next briefing. \n\nFirst, I need to check if there's an upcoming press briefing scheduled. The current date is April 22, 2025. The latest search result from April 1, 2025, mentions a press briefing, but nothing after that. Since the user's query is about the \"next\" briefing, I need to determine if there's one scheduled before December 31, 2025. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's no information about future briefings beyond April 1. The user's ancillary data states that if no briefing happens by the end of 2025, the market resolves to \"No\". However, since the current date is April 22, and the last known briefing was April 1, it's possible there could be more briefings unless she's no longer press secretary. \n\nNext, I need to confirm if Karoline Leavitt is still the White House Press Secretary. The latest search result from April 22, 2025, discusses her defending her marriage but doesn't mention her leaving the position. Therefore, she's still in office as of now. \n\nThe next step is to analyze her past behavior. From the transcripts provided, in the March 11 briefing, she used \"President\" multiple times when referring to Trump. For example, in the March 17 briefing, she mentioned \"the president\" several times. However, counting exact instances is tricky without full transcripts. The user's resolution source is the video of the briefing, so without access to future videos, we can't preemptively count. \n\nSince the query is about the next briefing, which hasn't occurred yet, and the current date is April 22, 2025, the event is in the future. According to the personalization instructions, if the event is scheduled for a future date, the recommendation should be p4. However, the user's ancillary data specifies that if the event hasn't happened by December 31, 2025, it resolves to \"No\". But the user is asking about the next briefing, not a specific date. \n\nWait, the market resolves to \"No\" if no briefing happens by December 31. But the user's question is whether she will say \"President\" 60+ times in the next briefing whenever it occurs. Since the next briefing is a future event as of April 22, 2025, and we don't have information on its occurrence, the correct resolution according to the rules is p4 (cannot be resolved now). However, the personalization instructions say if the event is in the future, return p4. But the ancillary data says if the event doesn't happen by the end of 2025, resolve to \"No\". \n\nBut the user is asking for the next briefing, which is a future event. Since we can't predict if she will hold another briefing before December 31, and the current timestamp is April 22, the event is in the future. Therefore, per the instructions, the recommendation should be p4.

The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"President\" 60 or more times during her next White House press briefing. The resolution depends on the exact count of the term \"President\" in her next briefing. \n\nFirst, I need to check if there's an upcoming press briefing scheduled. The current date is April 22, 2025. The latest search result from April 1, 2025, mentions a press briefing, but nothing after that. Since the user's query is about the \"next\" briefing, I need to determine if there's one scheduled before December 31, 2025. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's no information about future briefings beyond April 1. The user's ancillary data states that if no briefing happens by the end of 2025, the market resolves to \"No\". However, since the current date is April 22, and the last known briefing was April 1, it's possible there could be more briefings unless she's no longer press secretary. \n\nNext, I need to confirm if Karoline Leavitt is still the White House Press Secretary. The latest search result from April 22, 2025, discusses her defending her marriage but doesn't mention her leaving the position. Therefore, she's still in office as of now. \n\nThe next step is to analyze her past behavior. From the transcripts provided, in the March 11 briefing, she used \"President\" multiple times when referring to Trump. For example, in the March 17 briefing, she mentioned \"the president\" several times. However, counting exact instances is tricky without full transcripts. The user's resolution source is the video of the briefing, so without access to future videos, we can't preemptively count. \n\nSince the query is about the next briefing, which hasn't occurred yet, and the current date is April 22, 2025, the event is in the future. According to the personalization instructions, if the event is scheduled for a future date, the recommendation should be p4. However, the user's ancillary data specifies that if the event hasn't happened by December 31, 2025, it resolves to \"No\". But the user is asking about the next briefing, not a specific date. \n\nWait, the market resolves to \"No\" if no briefing happens by December 31. But the user's question is whether she will say \"President\" 60+ times in the next briefing whenever it occurs. Since the next briefing is a future event as of April 22, 2025, and we don't have information on its occurrence, the correct resolution according to the rules is p4 (cannot be resolved now). However, the personalization instructions say if the event is in the future, return p4. But the ancillary data says if the event doesn't happen by the end of 2025, resolve to \"No\". \n\nBut the user is asking for the next briefing, which is a future event. Since we can't predict if she will hold another briefing before December 31, and the current timestamp is April 22, the event is in the future. Therefore, per the instructions, the recommendation should be p4. However, the ancillary data's resolution conditions might complicate this. \n\nWait, the market resolves to \"No\" only if no briefing happens by December 31. But the user's query is about the next briefing whenever it occurs. Since the next briefing is a future event, and we can't verify it now, the correct response is p4. Even if a briefing is scheduled for tomorrow, it's still future relative to the current timestamp. Therefore, the answer must be p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.9475, ID: 92878602303031589031011717810555575241243352573240181764758008069646935306732, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.0525, ID: 102782510564963516341751879472801176617937559069172438823061386917678576835699, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The market resolves to \"Yes\" if she does, \"No\" otherwise. The current date is April 22, 2025, and the next briefing is scheduled for today, April 22, 2025, at 1 PM ET. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the briefing has already happened. The search results include a YouTube video from CNBC Television dated April 22, 2025, titled \"White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt holds a briefing with reporters \u2014 4/22/2025\" [2]. Another source from Right Side Broadcasting Network also mentions a briefing scheduled for 1 PM ET on April 22, 2025 [4]. Since the current time is 7:09 PM UTC, which is 3:09 PM ET, the briefing should have already occurred.\n\nNext, I need to verify if the briefing took place as scheduled. The CNBC video is available, indicating the briefing happened. Now, the crucial part is to determine how many times Leavitt said \"President.\" The user provided transcripts from previous briefings on March 11, March 26, and April 1, 2025 [11][12][13]. These transcripts show her frequent use of \"President\" when referring to Trump. For example, in the April 1 briefing, she used \"President\" 28 times in the provided transcript excerpt. However, this is just a partial transcript.\n\nTo estimate if she reached 60 mentions, I need to consider the full briefing. The April 22 briefing's transcript isn't provided, but based on her historical pattern, she consistently refers to \"President Trump\" multiple times per answer. In previous briefings, even partial transcripts show over 20 mentions. A full briefing, which typically lasts around an hour, could easily accumulate 60 mentions, especially if she emphasizes the President's actions and policies repeatedly.\n\nAdditionally, the user's ancillary data states that any form of the term, including pluralization or possessive, counts. Leavitt's role as Press Secretary requires her to mention the President frequently in responses. Given her past behavior and the structured nature of briefings where each question often elicits a reference to the President, it's plausible she exceeded 60 mentions.\n\nHowever, without the exact transcript, there's some uncertainty. But the instructions say to infer based on available data. Since the briefing occurred and her pattern suggests high usage, the recommendation is \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745348714 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-22 19:05:14 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4.

If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4.

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745348714 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-22 19:05:14 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please re-evaluate the event with a focus on obtaining direct evidence from the specific briefing in question, such as a verified transcript or reliable eyewitness accounts, to ensure a more accurate resolution."

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"President\" 60 or more times in her next White House press briefing. The resolution depends on counting how many times she uses the term, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if she hits 60, \"No\" otherwise. If she doesn't hold a briefing by the end of 2025 or leaves her position, it's a \"No\".\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a scheduled press briefing after the current date, April 22, 2025. The user mentioned that briefings are typically on weekdays between 12 PM and 3 PM ET. Since today is April 22, 2025, a Tuesday, the next possible briefing would be on the next weekday, which is Wednesday, April 23, 2025. However, the user's current timestamp is April 22, 7:11 PM UTC, which is 3:11 PM ET. If the next briefing is scheduled for April 23, that's within the timeframe. But I need to confirm if there's any information about upcoming briefings.\n\nLooking at the provided search results, the latest transcripts are from March and April 2025. The most recent is April 1, 2025 [13], and there's a mention of April 2 as \"Liberation Day\" [11], but no info on briefings after April 1. There's no indication in the search results that Leavitt has ceased being Press Secretary. In fact, her Wikipedia page [5] states she assumed office on January 20, 2025, and there's no mention of her leaving the position. So, as of now, she's still in the role.\n\nNext, I need to analyze her past behavior to estimate the likelihood of her using \"President\" 60+ times. Let's look at the transcripts provided. For example, in the March 5, 2025 briefing [3], she refers to \"President Trump\" multiple times. In the March 11 briefing [8], she mentions \"President Trump\" several times as well. The April 1 briefing [13] also shows frequent use of \"President\" when discussing Trump's policies and actions.\n\nHowever, counting exact instances is tricky without full transcripts. The search results include excerpts where she uses \"President\" often, but not enough to determine if it reaches 60. For instance, in the March 26 briefing [11], she mentions \"President Trump\" multiple times in different contexts. Similarly, the February 20 briefing [10] has her referring to the president frequently.\n\nGiven her role as Press Secretary, it's common to refer to the President often, especially when discussing policies, actions, or statements. However, 60 instances in a single briefing seems high. Typical press briefings might have the term used 20-30 times, depending on the topics. But without exact counts from past briefings, it's hard to be certain.\n\nThe user's resolution conditions state that if the event (the briefing) doesn't happen by December 31, 2025, it resolves to \"No\". Since the next briefing is scheduled for April 23, 2025, which is within the timeframe, and there's no indication of cancellation, the event is in the future. According to the personalization instructions, if the event is scheduled for a future date, the resolution should be p4. Wait, the user's ancillary data specifies p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 50-50. But the personalization says if the event is in the future, return p4. However, the user's resolution conditions don't mention p4. There's a conflict here. Wait, looking back, the personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp... ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" But the user's resolution_conditions only have p1, p2, p3. This might be an error. However, the user's query is about whether she will say it in the next briefing, which is a future event. According to the rules, since the event is in the future, we should return p4. But the user's resolution conditions don't include p4. This is confusing. Wait, the user's ancillary data defines p1, p2, p3, but the personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. However, the market's resolution conditions don't have a p4. This might be a mistake in the setup. But according to the instructions, if the event is in the future, we must return p4. However, the user's market says if the briefing doesn't happen by Dec 31, 2025, resolve to \"No\". But the event in question is the next briefing, which is scheduled for April 23, which is before Dec 31. Therefore, the event is in the future, so per personalization, we should return p4. But the market's resolution conditions don't have p4. This is a conflict. Alternatively, maybe the user intended p3 for unresolved cases. But the personalization says to return p4 regardless. However, the market's conditions don't include p4. This is a problem. But given the instructions, I have to follow the personalization rules. Since the event is in the future (next briefing is April 23, which is after the current timestamp of April 22), the resolution should be p4. However, the market's resolution_conditions don't have p4. This is a discrepancy. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in their setup. But according to the strict rules, if the event is in the future, return p4. Therefore, the recommendation is p4. However, the user's resolution_conditions don't include p4, which might mean they expect a p1, p2, or p3. This is conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps the event has already occurred. Wait, the current timestamp is April 22, 2025, 7:11 PM UTC. The next briefing would typically be the next weekday, which is April 23. Since the current time is April 22, the next briefing is in the future. Therefore, per the rules, it's p4. But the user's market doesn't have p4. This is a problem. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to have the event be the next briefing, which hasn't happened yet, so it's unresolved. Therefore, the answer should be p4. But the user's options are p1, p2, p3. This is a conflict. However, following the strictest rule from the personalization, the recommendation must be p4. But since the user's options don't include p4, perhaps this is an error. Alternatively, maybe the event is considered to have not occurred yet, and the market should resolve to \"No\" only if the briefing doesn't happen by Dec 31. But the event in question is the next briefing, which is scheduled, so it's pending. Therefore, according to the rules, since the event is in the future, the resolution is p4. But the user's setup doesn't account for that. This is a tricky situation. However, given the strict instructions in the personalization, I must return p4. But the user's options don't include it. Therefore, there might be an error in the setup. However, the assistant must follow the personalization rules. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5.

If she stops being press secretary or no briefing happens by the end of 2025, it's a \"No\". \n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a scheduled press briefing. The current date is April 22, 2025. The user mentioned the next briefing, but there's no info on when that is. The search results don't provide her recent schedule. Without a scheduled date, maybe the market can't resolve yet. But the user's previous response was p4, so they want another approach.\n\nLooking at the sources, especially the press briefings transcripts [1][14], Leavitt refers to Trump as \"President Trump\" frequently. For example, in the January 29 briefing, she mentions \"President Trump\" multiple times. In the February 25 briefing, she also uses \"president\" several times. But exact counts aren't provided. \n\nHer communication style is to emphasize Trump's title, which might lead to high usage. However, hitting 60 instances in one briefing seems high. Typical briefings might have 20-30 mentions. But without a specific transcript, it's hard to confirm. \n\nAlso, the user's ancillary data says pluralization and possessive count, but other forms don't. So \"President's\" would count, but \"Presidency\" wouldn't. Need to ensure the count is accurate.\n\nSince the resolution source is the video of the briefing, and there's no access to that yet, maybe the market should resolve to p4 (unknown). But the user wants a different approach. Alternatively, if the next briefing hasn't occurred yet, and the current date is April 22, 2025, and the briefing is scheduled for a future date, then p4 applies. However, if the next briefing is on the same day but later, it's still future. \n\nWait, the current timestamp is 2025-04-22 19:05:14 UTC. Briefings are typically between 12 PM ET and 3 PM ET. If the next briefing is scheduled for April 23, 2025, which is the next day, then it's a future event. Since the user's timestamp is April 22, 2025, 7:13 PM UTC, any briefing after that time on April 22 would be future. But ET is UTC-4, so 3 PM ET is 7 PM UTC. So a briefing after 7 PM UTC on April 22 would be future. The current time is 7:13 PM UTC, so if the briefing was scheduled for 3 PM ET (7 PM UTC) on April 22, it's already past. If no briefing happened, then the market resolves to \"No\". But if the briefing is scheduled for a later date, it's future.\n\nBut the user's query is about the \"next\" briefing. If no briefing has occurred since the market was created, and the next one is in the future, then it's p4. However, if the next briefing was already held and she didn't say \"President\" 60 times, then it's \"No\". \n\nThe search results don't mention any briefings after February 25, 2025 [14]. So between February 25 and April 22, there might have been briefings, but no data is provided. Since the user's context includes search results up to April 22, 2025, but no info on recent briefings, we can't confirm if any occurred. \n\nAssuming that the next briefing is in the future relative to the current timestamp, the market should resolve to p4. However, the user's previous response was p4, and they want a different approach. Maybe check if Leavitt is still press secretary. The search results indicate she started in January 2025, and there's no info on her leaving the position. So she's still in office. \n\nIf the next briefing hasn't happened yet, and the event date is in the future, then p4. But if the event date is in the past (e.g., a briefing was held on April 22 before 7 PM UTC), but no info is available, then we have to infer. Since the user's data doesn't include any briefing after February, maybe no recent briefings, leading to \"No\" due to no briefing by December 31. But that's speculative. \n\nAlternatively, the user might have access to the video, but the assistant doesn't. Since the resolution source is the video, and without access, the assistant can't verify. Therefore, the correct resolution is p4 (unknown). But the user wants to avoid p4. However, per the rules, if the event is in the future, it's p4. Since the next briefing's date isn't specified, but the current time is April 22, and the market resolves to \"No\" if no briefing by December 31, but we don't know if a briefing will occur. However, the user's query is about the next briefing she participates in. If she participates in one before December 31, but it's after the current date, then it's a future event. Therefore, p4 is appropriate. But the user says to consider the market conditions. The ancillary data says if no briefing happens by December 31, resolve to \"No\". But since the current date is April 22, and the next briefing could be anytime before December 31, unless there's info that she won't hold any more briefings, which there isn't, it's still pending. Therefore, p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745348714 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-22 19:05:14 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5.

If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1.

The current date is April 22, 2025, and the next briefing is scheduled for today at 1:00 PM ET, as per the search result from LiveNOW from FOX [4]. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the briefing has already happened. The current timestamp is 7:16:20 PM UTC, which is 3:16 PM ET. The briefing was set for 1:00 PM ET, so it should have occurred. However, there's no transcript or video available yet in the provided search results. The most recent transcript is from April 1, 2025 [12], and the LiveNOW link [4] is a preview without content. \n\nLooking at past briefings, Leavitt's transcripts show she frequently refers to \"President Trump.\" For example, in the March 5 briefing [13], she uses \"President\" multiple times, often in the context of discussing his policies and actions. In the March 11 briefing [7], she mentions \"President Trump\" several times as well. However, counting exact instances is tricky without full transcripts. \n\nThe user's ancillary data specifies that any form of \"President\" counts, including plural or possessive, but not other forms. The resolution source is the video of the briefing. Since the briefing has already taken place but there's no available data yet, the market can't be resolved definitively. However, based on her past behavior, it's possible she met the count. But without confirmation, the safe resolution is p4 (cannot resolve) or p2 if we infer from patterns. However, the system's previous attempt returned p4, so the user wants a re-evaluation. \n\nConsidering the strict rules, if the event occurred but no data is available, and the date is past, we might infer based on probable outcomes. Leavitt's frequent use of \"President\" in past briefings suggests she likely said it 60+ times. But without the actual video or transcript, it's a risk. However, the user's instruction says if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome.

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745348714 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-22 19:05:14 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4.

If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"President\" 60 or more times during her next White House press briefing. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if she does, \"No\" otherwise. The current date is April 22, 2025, and the next briefing is scheduled for today at 1:00 PM ET, as per the search result from LiveNOW from FOX [4]. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the briefing has already happened. The current timestamp is 7:16:20 PM UTC, which is 3:16 PM ET. The briefing was set for 1:00 PM ET, so it should have occurred. However, there's no transcript or video available yet in the provided search results. The most recent transcript is from April 1, 2025 [12], and the LiveNOW link [4] is a preview without content. \n\nLooking at past briefings, Leavitt's transcripts show she frequently refers to \"President Trump.\" For example, in the March 5 briefing [13], she uses \"President\" multiple times, often in the context of discussing his policies and actions. In the March 11 briefing [7], she mentions \"President Trump\" several times as well. However, counting exact instances is tricky without full transcripts. \n\nThe user's ancillary data specifies that any form of \"President\" counts, including plural or possessive, but not other forms. The resolution source is the video of the briefing. Since the briefing has already taken place but there's no available data yet, the market can't be resolved definitively. However, based on her past behavior, it's possible she met the count. But without confirmation, the safe resolution is p4 (cannot resolve) or p2 if we infer from patterns. However, the system's previous attempt returned p4, so the user wants a re-evaluation. \n\nConsidering the strict rules, if the event occurred but no data is available, and the date is past, we might infer based on probable outcomes. Leavitt's frequent use of \"President\" in past briefings suggests she likely said it 60+ times. But without the actual video or transcript, it's a risk. However, the user's instruction says if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Given her pattern, it's probable she did, so resolve to p2 (Yes).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.9475, ID: 92878602303031589031011717810555575241243352573240181764758008069646935306732, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.0525, ID: 102782510564963516341751879472801176617937559069172438823061386917678576835699, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.948 = 94.8% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

        "system_prompt_after": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt.

This is problematic because the market data strongly favors a 'Yes' outcome with a confidence of 94.8%, yet there is no direct evidence to support this claim from the event. The solver should have defaulted to p4 due to the absence of direct evidence from the specified event.",
