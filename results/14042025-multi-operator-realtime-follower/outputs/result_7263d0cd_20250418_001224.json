      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Pierre Poilievre said \"Trump\" three or more times during the Canadian Election Debate on April 17, 2025. The resolution depends on the exact count of the term \"Trump\" in his speech during that event.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for mentions of Poilievre's statements in the debate. The search results include several articles and transcripts from the debates on April 17. \n\nLooking at result [1], it's a video titled \"You're Not Welcome': Canada's 'TRUMP' Declares War On 'Illegals'\" from the Times of India. The description mentions Poilievre clashing over immigration and U.S. relations. However, the transcript isn't provided, so I can't count the mentions here.\n\nResult [2] from Politico states that Poilievre brought up Trump during the debate, quoting him saying, \u201cYou\u2019re just like Justin Trudeau,\u201d and Carney responding about confronting Trump. This indicates at least one mention.\n\nResult [3] from Times of India mentions the French-language debate where Trump was a key focus. Carney argued about handling Trump, but Poilievre's mentions aren't specified here.\n\nResult [4] from NDTV discusses the debate where Poilievre focused on expanding natural gas exports, mentioning Trump's policies. The article quotes Poilievre saying, \u201cNo one can control the decisions of Donald Trump. But we can control our domestic economy...\" which is one mention.\n\nResult [5] and [6] cover the English debate. Result [5] mentions Poilievre attacking Carney's policies but doesn't specify Trump mentions. Result [6] also discusses the debate but doesn't provide specific quotes from Poilievre regarding Trump.\n\nResult [7] from Hindustan Times quotes Poilievre saying, \u201cNo one can control the decisions of Donald Trump. But we can control our domestic economy...\" which is another mention.\n\nResult [8] is a video summary but doesn't provide a transcript. Result [9] is a video from February 2025, before the debate in question, so it's irrelevant. Result [10] is a transcript of a Harris-Trump debate, unrelated to Canada. \n\nResult [11] is a video from March 2025, also before the debate. Result [12] from Politico mentions Poilievre distancing from Trump but doesn't cite the debate. Result [13] quotes Carney criticizing Trump, not Poilievre. Result [14] is a video analysis but no transcript. Result [15] and [16] discuss the debate, with Carney emphasizing Trump as a key issue, but Poilievre's mentions aren't detailed. \n\nResult [17] is a transcript of the debate. In the transcript, Poilievre mentions Trump at least twice: once when discussing negotiations and tariffs, and another when talking about economic policies. However, the transcript is partial, so there might be more mentions not captured here.\n\nCombining the evidence: In the French debate (result [4] and [7]), Poilievre mentions Trump once. In the English debate (result [2], [4], [7]), he mentions Trump again. The debate transcript (result [17]) shows two mentions. However, without the full transcript, it's challenging to confirm the exact count. The available sources indicate at least two mentions, but the user requires three for \"Yes\". Since the evidence doesn't clearly show three instances, the resolution would lean towards \"No\" unless more mentions are found. However, considering the Politico article (result [2]) mentions Poilievre bringing up Trump, and other sources, it's possible there were three mentions.

The user wants to know if Pierre Poilievre said \"Trump\" three or more times during the Canadian Election Debate on April 17, 2025. The resolution depends on the exact count of the term \"Trump\" in his speech during that event.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for mentions of Poilievre's statements in the debate. The search results include several articles and transcripts from the debates on April 17. \n\nLooking at result [1], it's a video titled \"You're Not Welcome': Canada's 'TRUMP' Declares War On 'Illegals'\" from the Times of India. The description mentions Poilievre clashing over immigration and U.S. relations. However, the transcript isn't provided, so I can't count the mentions here.\n\nResult [2] from Politico states that Poilievre brought up Trump during the debate, quoting him saying, \u201cYou\u2019re just like Justin Trudeau,\u201d and Carney responding about confronting Trump. This indicates at least one mention.\n\nResult [3] from Times of India mentions the French-language debate where Trump was a key focus. Carney argued about handling Trump, but Poilievre's mentions aren't specified here.\n\nResult [4] from NDTV discusses the debate where Poilievre focused on expanding natural gas exports, mentioning Trump's policies. The article quotes Poilievre saying, \u201cNo one can control the decisions of Donald Trump. But we can control our domestic economy...\" which is one mention.\n\nResult [5] and [6] cover the English debate. Result [5] mentions Poilievre attacking Carney's policies but doesn't specify Trump mentions. Result [6] also discusses the debate but doesn't provide specific quotes from Poilievre regarding Trump.\n\nResult [7] from Hindustan Times quotes Poilievre saying, \u201cNo one can control the decisions of Donald Trump. But we can control our domestic economy...\" which is another mention.\n\nResult [8] is a video summary but doesn't provide a transcript. Result [9] is a video from February 2025, before the debate in question, so it's irrelevant. Result [10] is a transcript of a Harris-Trump debate, unrelated to Canada. \n\nResult [11] is a video from March 2025, also before the debate. Result [12] from Politico mentions Poilievre distancing from Trump but doesn't cite the debate. Result [13] quotes Carney criticizing Trump, not Poilievre. Result [14] is a video analysis but no transcript. Result [15] and [16] discuss the debate, with Carney emphasizing Trump as a key issue, but Poilievre's mentions aren't detailed. \n\nResult [17] is a transcript of the debate. In the transcript, Poilievre mentions Trump at least twice: once when discussing negotiations and tariffs, and another when talking about economic policies. However, the transcript is partial, so there might be more mentions not captured here.\n\nCombining the evidence: In the French debate (result [4] and [7]), Poilievre mentions Trump once. In the English debate (result [2], [4], [7]), he mentions Trump again. The debate transcript (result [17]) shows two mentions. However, without the full transcript, it's challenging to confirm the exact count. The available sources indicate at least two mentions, but the user requires three for \"Yes\". Since the evidence doesn't clearly show three instances, the resolution would lean towards \"No\" unless more mentions are found. However, considering the Politico article (result [2]) mentions Poilievre bringing up Trump, and other sources, it's possible there were three mentions. But without explicit evidence, it's safer to resolve as \"No\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.855, ID: 23368687474891736442464286928947502325507857963242392131967566024354528324164, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.145, ID: 33852964853249976298487574280047489866802349944132753503942636555504112029522, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.855 = 85.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The resolution depends on the exact count of the term \"Trump\" in his speech during that event.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for mentions of Poilievre's statements in the debate. The debate in question is the French-language one held on April 17, as per the user's ancillary data. The English debate was scheduled for the same day but later in the evening, but the user's focus is on the event date, which includes both debates. However, the resolution source is the video of the event, so I need to rely on the transcripts and reports available.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention Poilievre discussing Trump. For example, result [2] states that Poilievre argued for a national pipeline to reduce dependence on the U.S., mentioning Trump by name. Result [3] notes Poilievre's emphasis on expanding energy exports beyond the U.S. to counter Trump's influence. Result [4] directly quotes Poilievre saying, \"the question is who is going to face Mr. Trump,\" indicating at least one mention.\n\nResult [7] describes Poilievre's strategy to handle Trump's trade policies, where he mentions Trump in the context of economic policies. Result [9] includes Poilievre's statement about negotiating with Trump on tariffs, which is another mention. Result [13] quotes Poilievre saying, \"giving the power to Donald Trump on our own energy,\" which is a direct use of the name. Result [15] is a transcript where Poilievre mentions Trump multiple times, including in the context of tariffs and negotiations.\n\nCounting these instances across the sources, Poilievre refers to Trump by name at least three times during the debate. Each mention in different contexts (pipelines, tariffs, negotiations) confirms the count. Since the resolution conditions state that any usage of the term counts, including pluralization or possessive forms (which aren't present here), the answer should resolve to \"Yes.\"\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744934942 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-18 00:09:02 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Re-evaluate the available data or seek additional sources that could confirm the third mention of 'Trump' during the debate. Consider the market sentiment and investigate if there are additional insights or data that the market might be considering.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Pierre Poilievre said \"Trump\" three or more times during the Canadian Election Debate on April 17, 2025. The resolution depends on the exact count of the term \"Trump\" in his speech during that event.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for mentions of Poilievre's statements in the debate. The debate in question is the French-language one held on April 17, as per the user's ancillary data. The English debate was scheduled for the same day but later in the evening, but the user's focus is on the event date, which includes both debates. However, the resolution source is the video of the event, so I need to rely on the transcripts and reports available.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention Poilievre discussing Trump. For example, result [2] states that Poilievre argued for a national pipeline to reduce dependence on the U.S., mentioning Trump by name. Result [3] notes Poilievre's emphasis on expanding energy exports beyond the U.S. to counter Trump's influence. Result [4] directly quotes Poilievre saying, \"the question is who is going to face Mr. Trump,\" indicating at least one mention.\n\nResult [7] describes Poilievre's strategy to handle Trump's trade policies, where he mentions Trump in the context of economic policies. Result [9] includes Poilievre's statement about negotiating with Trump on tariffs, which is another mention. Result [13] quotes Poilievre saying, \"giving the power to Donald Trump on our own energy,\" which is a direct use of the name. Result [15] is a transcript where Poilievre mentions Trump multiple times, including in the context of tariffs and negotiations.\n\nCounting these instances across the sources, Poilievre refers to Trump by name at least three times during the debate. Each mention in different contexts (pipelines, tariffs, negotiations) confirms the count. Since the resolution conditions state that any usage of the term counts, including pluralization or possessive forms (which aren't present here), the answer should resolve to \"Yes.\"\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.855, ID: 23368687474891736442464286928947502325507857963242392131967566024354528324164, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.145, ID: 33852964853249976298487574280047489866802349944132753503942636555504112029522, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.855 = 85.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
