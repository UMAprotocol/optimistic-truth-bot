      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Pierre Poilievre said the word \"French\" three or more times during the Canadian Election Debate on April 17, 2025. The resolution depends on the exact count from the event's video.\n\nFirst, I need to check all the provided search results for mentions of Poilievre's statements during the debate. The search results are from various news outlets covering the debate. Since the user specified that the resolution source is the video of the event, but we don't have direct access to the video, we have to rely on the transcripts and reports from these sources.\n\nLooking through the search results, several articles mention parts of the debate. For example, in [1], [4], and [15], there's a detailed account of the debate. Poilievre is quoted discussing economic policies, pipelines, and responding to other leaders. However, none of these quotes include the word \"French.\" \n\nIn [9], there's a specific exchange where Poilievre is asked about defending the French language in Quebec. He states, \u201cYou\u2019re a Liberal, you love to raise taxes. That\u2019s what your party does,\u201d but the exact word \"French\" isn't mentioned here. Another part of [9] mentions Poilievre talking about protecting the French language and increasing funding for French immersion programs. Here, he uses the word \"French\" when discussing language policies. \n\nFurther, in [10], it's noted that Poilievre addressed the use of the notwithstanding clause to defend the French language, which would involve using the term \"French.\" Additionally, [12] and [14] discuss the debate's focus on Quebec and French-language issues, but specific mentions of Poilievre saying \"French\" aren't detailed. \n\nHowever, in [9], during the 7:45 p.m. update, Poilievre is asked about Quebec's right to defend the French language using the notwithstanding clause. His response includes, \u201cYou\u2019re a Liberal, you love to raise taxes. That\u2019s what your party does,\u201d but the exact word \"French\" isn't captured in the quote. However, the context implies he was discussing French language policies. \n\nAnother instance in [9] at 7:45 p.m.: Poilievre says he\u2019ll increase funding to help youth take part in French immersion, which directly uses the word \"French.\" Additionally, in [10], it's mentioned that Poilievre emphasized buying Canadian products, but the term \"French\" isn't in those quotes. \n\nWait, looking back at [9], the exact quote is: \u201cPoilievre says he\u2019ll increase funding to help youth take part in French immersion and ensure that Quebec has more control over immigrant selection.\u201d Here, \"French immersion\" includes the word \"French,\" which counts as per the user's conditions (pluralization/possessive and compound words are allowed). So \"French\" in \"French immersion\" counts as one instance. \n\nAnother mention in [9] during the 7:37 p.m. update: Poilievre discusses uniting Canadians but doesn't use \"French.\" In [10], there's a mention of the French-language debate, but that's the event's title, not Poilievre's words. \n\nIn [12], a columnist notes that Poilievre's French was good, but that's about his language skills, not him saying the word \"French.\" \n\nLooking through all the sources, the only direct mention of Poilievre using \"French\" is in the context of \"French immersion\" in [9]. Are there other instances? Let me check again. \n\nIn [3], Poilievre's message about economic independence in the French debate might involve the term, but the quotes provided don't include it. [6] discusses pipelines and Trump, no mention of \"French.\" [7] and [8] also focus on economic policies without the term. \n\n[14] mentions the debate was in French, but again, that's the event's context, not Poilievre's usage. \n\nSo, based on the available sources, the only explicit mention of Poilievre using the word \"French\" is in \"French immersion\" once. The user's condition requires three or more instances. Since the sources don't report other instances, it's possible he didn't reach three. However, the debate was in French, and he might have used the term more, but without explicit mentions in the sources, we can't confirm. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that if the event occurred but no verifiable info on the outcome, assume the most probable outcome. However, the user's instruction says to resolve based on verifiable sources. Since the sources only show one instance, the answer would be \"No.\" But wait, the user's ancillary data says p2 is \"Yes\" if the term is said three or more times. \n\nBut according to the sources, we only have one verified instance. Therefore, the resolution should be \"No\" (p1). However, if the debate's context implies more usage, but it's not captured in the sources, we have to stick to the available information. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p1: No.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744939015 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-18 01:16:55 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Pierre Poilievre said the word \"French\" three or more times during the Canadian Election Debate on April 17, 2025. The resolution depends on the exact count from the event's video.\n\nFirst, I need to check all the provided search results for mentions of Poilievre's statements during the debate. The search results are from various news outlets covering the debate. Since the user specified that the resolution source is the video of the event, but we don't have direct access to the video, we have to rely on the transcripts and reports from these sources.\n\nLooking through the search results, several articles mention parts of the debate. For example, in [1], [4], and [15], there's a detailed account of the debate. Poilievre is quoted discussing economic policies, pipelines, and responding to other leaders. However, none of these quotes include the word \"French.\" \n\nIn [9], there's a specific exchange where Poilievre is asked about defending the French language in Quebec. He states, \u201cYou\u2019re a Liberal, you love to raise taxes. That\u2019s what your party does,\u201d but the exact word \"French\" isn't mentioned here. Another part of [9] mentions Poilievre talking about protecting the French language and increasing funding for French immersion programs. Here, he uses the word \"French\" when discussing language policies. \n\nFurther, in [10], it's noted that Poilievre addressed the use of the notwithstanding clause to defend the French language, which would involve using the term \"French.\" Additionally, [12] and [14] discuss the debate's focus on Quebec and French-language issues, but specific mentions of Poilievre saying \"French\" aren't detailed. \n\nHowever, in [9], during the 7:45 p.m. update, Poilievre is asked about Quebec's right to defend the French language using the notwithstanding clause. His response includes, \u201cYou\u2019re a Liberal, you love to raise taxes. That\u2019s what your party does,\u201d but the exact word \"French\" isn't captured in the quote. However, the context implies he was discussing French language policies. \n\nAnother instance in [9] at 7:45 p.m.: Poilievre says he\u2019ll increase funding to help youth take part in French immersion, which directly uses the word \"French.\" Additionally, in [10], it's mentioned that Poilievre emphasized buying Canadian products, but the term \"French\" isn't in those quotes. \n\nWait, looking back at [9], the exact quote is: \u201cPoilievre says he\u2019ll increase funding to help youth take part in French immersion and ensure that Quebec has more control over immigrant selection.\u201d Here, \"French immersion\" includes the word \"French,\" which counts as per the user's conditions (pluralization/possessive and compound words are allowed). So \"French\" in \"French immersion\" counts as one instance. \n\nAnother mention in [9] during the 7:37 p.m. update: Poilievre discusses uniting Canadians but doesn't use \"French.\" In [10], there's a mention of the French-language debate, but that's the event's title, not Poilievre's words. \n\nIn [12], a columnist notes that Poilievre's French was good, but that's about his language skills, not him saying the word \"French.\" \n\nLooking through all the sources, the only direct mention of Poilievre using \"French\" is in the context of \"French immersion\" in [9]. Are there other instances? Let me check again. \n\nIn [3], Poilievre's message about economic independence in the French debate might involve the term, but the quotes provided don't include it. [6] discusses pipelines and Trump, no mention of \"French.\" [7] and [8] also focus on economic policies without the term. \n\n[14] mentions the debate was in French, but again, that's the event's context, not Poilievre's usage. \n\nSo, based on the available sources, the only explicit mention of Poilievre using the word \"French\" is in \"French immersion\" once. The user's condition requires three or more instances. Since the sources don't report other instances, it's possible he didn't reach three. However, the debate was in French, and he might have used the term more, but without explicit mentions in the sources, we can't confirm. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that if the event occurred but no verifiable info on the outcome, assume the most probable outcome.

Therefore, the resolution should be \"No\" (p1). However, if the debate's context implies more usage, but it's not captured in the sources, we have to stick to the available information. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p1: No.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.37, ID: 52671493002316038352921120808885761685452437325278520523200545030500188010469, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.63, ID: 13757072319049839713698694164456577465454325696208336742848093734191141235882, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market is relatively uncertain (YES: 0.370, NO: 0.630)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
