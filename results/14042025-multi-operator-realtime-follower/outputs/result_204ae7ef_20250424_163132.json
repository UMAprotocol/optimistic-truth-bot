      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump's approval rating will hit 45% or below before August 2025, using Silver Bulletin's data. The current date is April 24, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check the latest approval rating from Silver Bulletin. According to search result [1], as of April 23, Trump's approval is 44.8%, which is already below 45%. The article mentions this is a new low. So that's a key point. \n\nBut wait, the market resolution period is from April 14 to July 31. The current data point is April 23, which is within that window. The query says if the rating is equal to or below 45% on any date in that period, it resolves to Yes. Since 44.8% is below 45%, that should trigger a Yes. \n\nHowever, I need to confirm if this data point is finalized. The note says approval ratings must be finalized, meaning once the next data point is available, the previous one is considered final. The current data is from April 23, and the next data point would be after that. If there's a newer data point after April 23, then April 23's data is finalized. But the latest info we have is from April 23, and the current date is April 24. If Silver Bulletin updates daily, maybe the April 23 data is the latest finalized. \n\nLooking at search result [3], an article from April 24 states Trump's approval is 44.9% according to Decision Desk HQ, but the user's resolution source is Silver Bulletin, which is at 44.8%. So Silver Bulletin's data is already below 45%. \n\nTherefore, since the condition is met (approval \u226445% between April 14 and July 31), the market should resolve to Yes (p2). Even if the rating goes up later, the fact that it was already below 45% during the period means Yes. \n\nI should also check if there's any reason to doubt the Silver Bulletin data. The user specified that methodology changes don't affect resolution, so even if Silver Bulletin changes their method later, the existing data points still count. \n\nNo conflicting information in the sources. All point to approval being below 45% as of April 23. So the answer is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745512251 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-24 16:30:51 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump's approval rating will hit 45% or below before August 2025, using Silver Bulletin's data. The current date is April 24, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check the latest approval rating from Silver Bulletin. According to search result [1], as of April 23, Trump's approval is 44.8%, which is already below 45%. The article mentions this is a new low. So that's a key point. \n\nBut wait, the market resolution period is from April 14 to July 31. The current data point is April 23, which is within that window. The query says if the rating is equal to or below 45% on any date in that period, it resolves to Yes. Since 44.8% is below 45%, that should trigger a Yes. \n\nHowever, I need to confirm if this data point is finalized. The note says approval ratings must be finalized, meaning once the next data point is available, the previous one is considered final. The current data is from April 23, and the next data point would be after that. If there's a newer data point after April 23, then April 23's data is finalized. But the latest info we have is from April 23, and the current date is April 24. If Silver Bulletin updates daily, maybe the April 23 data is the latest finalized. \n\nLooking at search result [3], an article from April 24 states Trump's approval is 44.9% according to Decision Desk HQ, but the user's resolution source is Silver Bulletin, which is at 44.8%. So Silver Bulletin's data is already below 45%. \n\nTherefore, since the condition is met (approval \u226445% between April 14 and July 31), the market should resolve to Yes (p2). Even if the rating goes up later, the fact that it was already below 45% during the period means Yes. \n\nI should also check if there's any reason to doubt the Silver Bulletin data. The user specified that methodology changes don't affect resolution, so even if Silver Bulletin changes their method later, the existing data points still count. \n\nNo conflicting information in the sources. All point to approval being below 45% as of April 23. So the answer is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.996, ID: 57367936630158381182881166223598640377452683677695997279911849796039950677136, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.004, ID: 35039359325614494296212149615743870107252040166825797594701368218645117439931, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.996 = 99.6% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
