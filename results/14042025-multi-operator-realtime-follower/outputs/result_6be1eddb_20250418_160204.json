      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the Fear & Greed Index showed \"Extreme Fear\" on April 18, 2025, at 12:00 PM ET. The resolution source is CNN's Fear & Greed Index. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mention of the index on that specific date. The current date given is April 18, 2025. Looking at the search results:\n\nResult [5] from April 11, 2025, mentions the index plunged to 3, then improved to 8. That's still in Extreme Fear (0-25). Result [3] from April 8, 2024, shows a Greed reading of 61. But that's a year earlier. Results [1] and [2] are from 2020, which is too old. Result [4] explains the index components but doesn't provide current data. Result [6] is a general explanation from Investopedia.\n\nSince the latest data in the search results is from April 11, 2025, where the index was at 8 (Extreme Fear), but the query is about April 18. There's no newer data provided here. The user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. However, the resolution conditions specify using the last available update if CNN stops updating. \n\nBut wait, the current timestamp is April 18, 2025, 4:00 PM UTC, which is after 12:00 PM ET (which is 16:00 UTC, same as 4 PM UTC). So the resolution time has already passed. If CNN's site wasn't updated, we use the last available update. The last update in the search results is April 11, which was 8 (Extreme Fear). However, the user's query is about April 18. If there's no data for April 18, but the event date is in the past, and no info contradicts, we might have to resolve based on the last available data. But the resolution conditions say if CNN stops updating, use the last update. However, the user's query is specifically about April 18. If CNN did update on April 18, but it's not in the provided search results, we can't confirm. But according to the provided data, the latest is April 11. Since the current date is April 18, and the search results don't include any data beyond April 11, we have to assume that the last available update is from April 11, which was Extreme Fear. However, the resolution time is April 18, 12 PM ET. If CNN didn't update by then, the last update would be prior. But without information confirming an update on April 18, and given the provided data stops at April 11, we can't confirm the index was Extreme Fear on April 18. Therefore, the answer would be p4 (cannot resolve). Wait, no. The user's ancillary data says if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. But the resolution conditions also mention that if CNN stops updating, use the last available update. Since the event date is April 18, which is the same day as the current timestamp, but the time is 12 PM ET, which is 4 PM UTC. The current timestamp is 4:00 PM UTC, so the event time has just passed. If there's no update yet, perhaps the last update is from a previous day. But in the search results, the latest is April 11. If CNN hasn't updated since then, the last available would be 8 (Extreme Fear), so the answer would be Yes (p2). But the user's personalization says if the event is scheduled for the same day but later time, it's still future. Wait, the current time is 4:00 PM UTC on April 18, and the resolution time is 12 PM ET (4 PM UTC). So the event time is exactly the current time. If the index is checked at that time, but the provided search results don't include data for April 18, we can't confirm. However, result [5] mentions that as of April 11, the index was at 8, Extreme Fear, and it's possible that it remained in that range up to April 18. But without explicit data, we can't be certain. The user's instructions say if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The conditions in the query are that the market resolves to Yes if the index says Extreme Fear at the specified time. Since the last known value was Extreme Fear, and assuming no update, the resolution would be Yes. However, if the index was updated on April 18 and showed a different value, but that's not in the search results, we can't know. But according to the provided data, the last available is Extreme Fear. Therefore, the recommendation would be p2 (Yes).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Fear & Greed Index says \"Extreme Fear\" on Friday?, description: This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if the Fear and Greed Index says \"Extreme Fear\" when it is checked on April 18, 2025, 12:00 PM ET.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be CNN's Fear & Greed Index, found here: https://edition.cnn.com/markets/fear-and-greed\n\nIn the event that CNN stops updating its Fear & Greed Index, this market will resolve to the last available update on the stated resolution time.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744992052 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-18 16:00:52 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the Fear & Greed Index showed \"Extreme Fear\" on April 18, 2025, at 12:00 PM ET. The resolution source is CNN's Fear & Greed Index. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mention of the index on that specific date. The current date given is April 18, 2025. Looking at the search results:\n\nResult [5] from April 11, 2025, mentions the index plunged to 3, then improved to 8. That's still in Extreme Fear (0-25). Result [3] from April 8, 2024, shows a Greed reading of 61. But that's a year earlier. Results [1] and [2] are from 2020, which is too old. Result [4] explains the index components but doesn't provide current data. Result [6] is a general explanation from Investopedia.\n\nSince the latest data in the search results is from April 11, 2025, where the index was at 8 (Extreme Fear), but the query is about April 18. There's no newer data provided here. The user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. However, the resolution conditions specify using the last available update if CNN stops updating. \n\nBut wait, the current timestamp is April 18, 2025, 4:00 PM UTC, which is after 12:00 PM ET (which is 16:00 UTC, same as 4 PM UTC). So the resolution time has already passed. If CNN's site wasn't updated, we use the last available update. The last update in the search results is April 11, which was 8 (Extreme Fear). However, the user's query is about April 18. If there's no data for April 18, but the event date is in the past, and no info contradicts, we might have to resolve based on the last available data. But the resolution conditions say if CNN stops updating, use the last update. However, the user's query is specifically about April 18. If CNN did update on April 18, but it's not in the provided search results, we can't confirm. But according to the provided data, the latest is April 11. Since the current date is April 18, and the search results don't include any data beyond April 11, we have to assume that the last available update is from April 11, which was Extreme Fear. However, the resolution time is April 18, 12 PM ET. If CNN didn't update by then, the last update would be prior. But without information confirming an update on April 18, and given the provided data stops at April 11, we can't confirm the index was Extreme Fear on April 18. Therefore, the answer would be p4 (cannot resolve). Wait, no. The user's ancillary data says if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. But the resolution conditions also mention that if CNN stops updating, use the last available update. Since the event date is April 18, which is the same day as the current timestamp, but the time is 12 PM ET, which is 4 PM UTC. The current timestamp is 4:00 PM UTC, so the event time has just passed. If there's no update yet, perhaps the last update is from a previous day. But in the search results, the latest is April 11. If CNN hasn't updated since then, the last available would be 8 (Extreme Fear), so the answer would be Yes (p2). But the user's personalization says if the event is scheduled for the same day but later time, it's still future. Wait, the current time is 4:00 PM UTC on April 18, and the resolution time is 12 PM ET (4 PM UTC). So the event time is exactly the current time. If the index is checked at that time, but the provided search results don't include data for April 18, we can't confirm. However, result [5] mentions that as of April 11, the index was at 8, Extreme Fear, and it's possible that it remained in that range up to April 18. But without explicit data, we can't be certain. The user's instructions say if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The conditions in the query are that the market resolves to Yes if the index says Extreme Fear at the specified time. Since the last known value was Extreme Fear, and assuming no update, the resolution would be Yes. However, if the index was updated on April 18 and showed a different value, but that's not in the search results, we can't know. But according to the provided data, the last available is Extreme Fear. Therefore, the recommendation would be p2 (Yes).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.9965, ID: 70283474518241723212759570378294149499743598203146288883245624657583127423603, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.0035, ID: 70068667572203146615404496688536100619565101364802691042442616864262428343249, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.997 = 99.7% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
