      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say the word \"Golf\" during her next White House press briefing. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if she does, \"No\" otherwise. The key here is to check if there's any scheduled briefing and if she's likely to mention \"Golf\" based on past behavior and current context.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp is 2025-04-16 20:32:27 UTC. The user's query is from April 16, 2025, at 8:34 PM UTC. The next briefing would typically be on a weekday between 12 PM and 3 PM ET. Since the current time is 8:34 PM UTC on April 16, which is 4:34 PM ET, the next possible briefing would be the following day, April 17, 2025, unless there's one scheduled later on the 16th.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's a mention of a press briefing on April 16 at 4:30 PM ET (result [2] and [5]). Result [2] from LiveNOW from FOX mentions a briefing at 1:00 PM ET on April 16, but the current time is past that. However, result [5] from WTOV9 mentions a 4:30 PM EST briefing on April 16 with a special guest. The current time is 8:34 PM UTC, which is 4:34 PM ET, so the 4:30 PM ET briefing would have just occurred. The user's query is timestamped at 8:34 PM UTC, which is after the briefing. Therefore, the next briefing after the query time would be the next scheduled one, but since the 4:30 PM briefing on April 16 already happened, we need to check if that briefing occurred and if \"Golf\" was mentioned.\n\nWait, the user's query is about the \"next\" White House press briefing she participates in. Since the query is made on April 16 at 8:34 PM UTC, the next briefing would be the one on April 17, unless there's another one on the 16th after the query time. However, the 4:30 PM ET briefing on April 16 (which is 20:30 UTC) would have already taken place before the query time (20:34 UTC). Wait, no: 4:30 PM ET is 20:30 UTC. The query is at 20:34 UTC, so the briefing happened at 20:30 UTC, four minutes before the query. Therefore, the next briefing after the query would be the next day, April 17. But the user is asking about the \"next\" briefing after the query time. However, the market resolution conditions state that if no briefing happens by December 31, 2025, it resolves to \"No\". But given that briefings are regular, it's likely there will be one soon.\n\nBut wait, the user's query is about whether \"Golf\" is mentioned in the next briefing she participates in. If the briefing on April 16 at 4:30 PM ET (which is after the query time) has already occurred, we need to check if \"Golf\" was mentioned there. However, the search results provided don't include the transcript of that specific briefing. The latest available info is up to April 16, 2025, but the briefing at 4:30 PM ET on April 16 is mentioned in result [5], but there's no transcript provided in the search results. The user's current timestamp is 2025-04-16 20:32:27 UTC, which is just after the 4:30 PM ET briefing (20:30 UTC). Therefore, the next briefing after the query time would be the next one, but since the search results don't include data beyond April 16, we have to rely on existing information.\n\nHowever, the user is asking about the \"next\" briefing after the query time. Since the query is on April 16 at 8:34 PM UTC, the next briefing would be on April 17. But without information about that future briefing, we can't know for sure. However, the market resolution conditions state that if the event hasn't occurred by the resolution date, it resolves to \"No\". But the user is asking to resolve based on available information up to the current timestamp.\n\nWait, the ancillary data says: \"If no such press briefing happens by December 31, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to 'No'. If Leavitt ceases to be White House press secretary by that date, resolve to 'No'.\" But the query is about the next briefing she participates in. Since the current date is April 16, 2025, and she is still the press secretary, we need to determine if in the next briefing (which would be after the query time), she says \"Golf\".\n\nBut given that the search results don't include the transcript of the April 16 4:30 PM ET briefing, and the query is made just after that time, we have to check if that briefing occurred and if \"Golf\" was mentioned. However, the provided search results don't include that data. The latest info is from April 16, 2025, mentioning the 4:30 PM briefing but no transcript. Therefore, based on the available data, we can't confirm if \"Golf\" was mentioned in that briefing. However, there's a video in result [16] from April 12 where Leavitt is asked about Trump golfing instead of attending a transfer ceremony, and she mentions \"golfing\" in her response. This indicates that she has used the term in past briefings when discussing Trump's activities.\n\nAdditionally, result [18] from April 13 discusses Trump's golf victories and how the White House uses them as evidence of his health. Leavitt might reference this in a briefing, especially if asked about Trump's health or activities. However, without confirmation from the April 16 briefing, we have to consider the likelihood based on past behavior. Since she has used \"golf\" before, there's a chance she might do so again, especially if questions about Trump's schedule or health arise.\n\nBut the market resolution depends on the next briefing she participates in after the query time. Since the query is on April 16 at 8:34 PM UTC, the next briefing would be the one on April 17. However, without data on that future event, we can't be certain. However, the market's resolution conditions state that if the event (the briefing) hasn't occurred by December 31, 2025, it resolves to \"No\". But given that briefings are regular, it's likely that there will be future briefings. However, the user is asking about the next one. If the next briefing after the query time is the one on April 17, and given that Leavitt has mentioned \"golf\" in previous briefings when relevant, there's a possibility. But without explicit evidence from the next briefing, the resolution would default to \"No\" unless there's confirmation.\n\nWait, but the user's query is timestamped on April 16, 2025, at 8:34 PM UTC. The briefing at 4:30 PM ET on April 16 (20:30 UTC) occurred just before the query time. Therefore, the next briefing would be the one after the query time, which is the next day, April 17. However, the search results don't include information about that briefing. Therefore, based on the available information up to April 16, we can't confirm if \"Golf\" was mentioned in the next briefing. However, the market resolves based on whether the term is used in the next briefing she participates in after the query time. Since the query is about a future event (the next briefing after April 16, 8:34 PM UTC), and without information about that briefing, the resolution would depend on whether the term is used in that future event. However, the user is asking to resolve the market now, based on the current information. Since the event (the next briefing) hasn't occurred yet (as of the query time), the market should resolve to \"No\" because the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp. Wait, but the current timestamp is April 16, 8:32 PM UTC, and the query is at 8:34 PM UTC. The briefing at 4:30 PM ET (20:30 UTC) on April 16 would have occurred at 20:30 UTC, which is two minutes before the query time. Therefore, the next briefing after the query time would be the next one, which is April 17. Since the event (the next briefing) is scheduled for a future date relative to the current timestamp, the market should resolve to p4 (cannot be resolved now). But wait, the resolution conditions state that if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, resolve to p4. However, the user's query is about the next briefing she participates in, which could be on April 17, which is a future date. Therefore, the correct resolution is p4. But wait, the market's resolution conditions say: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" Since the next briefing is scheduled for April 17, which is a future date relative to the current timestamp (April 16), the market should resolve to p4. However, the user might be referring to the briefing that occurred on April 16 at 4:30 PM ET, which is just before the query time. If that briefing is considered the \"next\" one, but the query is made after it, then we need to check if \"Golf\" was mentioned there. However, the search results don't include the transcript of that briefing. Result [5] mentions the briefing but doesn't provide details. Without the transcript, we can't confirm if \"Golf\" was mentioned. Therefore, if the event has already occurred (the 4:30 PM ET briefing on April 16) but there's no information available, the resolution would be based on the most probable outcome. Given that Leavitt has mentioned \"golf\" in previous briefings (result [16]), there's a chance she might have done so again. However, without confirmation, the resolution would default to p4 if the event is in the past but no info is available. Wait, the resolution conditions state: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" The event (the April 16 briefing) is in the past relative to the query time (April 16, 8:34 PM UTC). However, there's no information in the search results about whether \"Golf\" was mentioned. Therefore, we have to assume the most probable outcome. Given that Leavitt has previously mentioned \"golf\" when defending Trump's activities (result [16]), and there's recent news about Trump's golf victories (result [18]), it's possible that the topic came up in the April 16 briefing. However, without explicit evidence, we can't confirm. Therefore, the resolution would be p4 (unknown) if the event has occurred but no info is available. However, the user's instructions say: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" The ancillary data's resolution conditions have p2 as \"Yes\" and p1 as \"No\". The most probable outcome would depend on context. Since Leavitt has a history of mentioning \"golf\" in relation to Trump, and there's recent news about Trump's golfing, it's plausible she mentioned it. However, without confirmation, the safe resolution is p4. But the user's instructions say to resolve based on the most probable outcome if the event is in the past and no info is available. Therefore, considering the context, the probability leans towards \"Yes\" (p2) because she has mentioned it before when relevant. Therefore, the recommendation would be p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744835547 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-16 20:32:27 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say the word \"Golf\" during her next White House press briefing. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if she does, \"No\" otherwise. The key here is to check if there's any scheduled briefing and if she's likely to mention \"Golf\" based on past behavior and current context.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp is 2025-04-16 20:32:27 UTC. The user's query is from April 16, 2025, at 8:34 PM UTC. The next briefing would typically be on a weekday between 12 PM and 3 PM ET. Since the current time is 8:34 PM UTC on April 16, which is 4:34 PM ET, the next possible briefing would be the following day, April 17, 2025, unless there's one scheduled later on the 16th.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's a mention of a press briefing on April 16 at 4:30 PM ET (result [2] and [5]). Result [2] from LiveNOW from FOX mentions a briefing at 1:00 PM ET on April 16, but the current time is past that. However, result [5] from WTOV9 mentions a 4:30 PM EST briefing on April 16 with a special guest. The current time is 8:34 PM UTC, which is 4:34 PM ET, so the 4:30 PM ET briefing would have just occurred. The user's query is timestamped at 8:34 PM UTC, which is after the briefing. Therefore, the next briefing after the query time would be the next scheduled one, but since the 4:30 PM briefing on April 16 already happened, we need to check if that briefing occurred and if \"Golf\" was mentioned.\n\nWait, the user's query is about the \"next\" White House press briefing she participates in. Since the query is made on April 16 at 8:34 PM UTC, the next briefing would be the one on April 17, unless there's another one on the 16th after the query time. However, the 4:30 PM ET briefing on April 16 (which is 20:30 UTC) would have already taken place before the query time (20:34 UTC). Wait, no: 4:30 PM ET is 20:30 UTC. The query is at 20:34 UTC, so the briefing happened at 20:30 UTC, four minutes before the query. Therefore, the next briefing after the query would be the next day, April 17. But the user is asking about the \"next\" briefing after the query time. However, the market resolution conditions state that if no briefing happens by December 31, 2025, it resolves to \"No\". But given that briefings are regular, it's likely there will be one soon.\n\nBut wait, the user's query is about whether \"Golf\" is mentioned in the next briefing she participates in. If the briefing on April 16 at 4:30 PM ET (which is after the query time) has already occurred, we need to check if \"Golf\" was mentioned there. However, the search results provided don't include the transcript of that specific briefing. The latest available info is up to April 16, 2025, but the briefing at 4:30 PM ET on April 16 is mentioned in result [5], but there's no transcript provided in the search results. The user's current timestamp is 2025-04-16 20:32:27 UTC, which is just after the 4:30 PM ET briefing (20:30 UTC). Therefore, the next briefing after the query time would be the next one, but since the search results don't include data beyond April 16, we have to rely on existing information.\n\nHowever, the user is asking about the \"next\" briefing after the query time. Since the query is on April 16 at 8:34 PM UTC, the next briefing would be on April 17. But without information about that future briefing, we can't know for sure. However, the market resolution conditions state that if the event hasn't occurred by the resolution date, it resolves to \"No\". But the user is asking to resolve based on available information up to the current timestamp.\n\nWait, the ancillary data says: \"If no such press briefing happens by December 31, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to 'No'. If Leavitt ceases to be White House press secretary by that date, resolve to 'No'.\" But the query is about the next briefing she participates in.

This indicates that she has used the term in past briefings when discussing Trump's activities.\n\nAdditionally, result [18] from April 13 discusses Trump's golf victories and how the White House uses them as evidence of his health.

Therefore, based on the available information up to April 16, we can't confirm if \"Golf\" was mentioned in the next briefing. However, the market resolves based on whether the term is used in the next briefing she participates in after the query time. Since the query is about a future event (the next briefing after April 16, 8:34 PM UTC), and without information about that briefing, the resolution would depend on whether the term is used in that future event. However, the user is asking to resolve the market now, based on the current information. Since the event (the next briefing) hasn't occurred yet (as of the query time), the market should resolve to \"No\" because the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp. Wait, but the current timestamp is April 16, 8:32 PM UTC, and the query is at 8:34 PM UTC. The briefing at 4:30 PM ET (20:30 UTC) on April 16 would have occurred at 20:30 UTC, which is two minutes before the query time. Therefore, the next briefing after the query time would be the next one, which is April 17. Since the event (the next briefing) is scheduled for a future date relative to the current timestamp, the market should resolve to p4 (cannot be resolved now). But wait, the resolution conditions state that if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, resolve to p4. However, the user's query is about the next briefing she participates in, which could be on April 17, which is a future date. Therefore, the correct resolution is p4. But wait, the market's resolution conditions say: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say the word \"golf\" during her next White House press briefing. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if she does, \"No\" (p1) if she doesn't, and p3 if it's uncertain. The deadline is December 31, 2025, and if she's no longer press secretary by then, it resolves to \"No\".\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is April 16, 2025. The next press briefing after this date would be the one on April 15, 2025, but wait, that's before the current date. Wait, no, the current date is April 16, 2025, so the next briefing after April 16 would be the one on April 15? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe there's a typo. Let me check the search results again.\n\nLooking at the search results, the most recent press briefings are from April 15, 2025. The user's current timestamp is April 16, 2025. So the next briefing after April 16 would be after that date. However, the search results don't include any briefings after April 15. The latest one is from April 15, 2025. So if the next briefing is after April 16, but there's no data yet, then we have to check if there's any scheduled briefings. The user's query mentions that if no briefing happens by December 31, it resolves to \"No\". But since the current date is April 16, and the next briefing hasn't occurred yet, we need to check if there's any upcoming briefings.\n\nWait, the user's query is about the next White House press briefing she participates in. Since the current date is April 16, 2025, and the latest briefing was on April 15, the next one would be after April 16. However, the search results don't provide information about future briefings beyond April 15. Therefore, we can't confirm if she said \"golf\" in a briefing after April 16. But the user's previous response was p2, which is \"Yes\", and they're asking to try again with a different approach.\n\nWait, maybe the user is referring to the April 15 briefing. Let me check the transcripts from that day. Search result [9] is a video from the White House on April 15, but the transcript isn't provided. Search result [10] is another video from the same day by Right Side Broadcasting Network, but again, no transcript. Search result [11] links to the White House page for the April 15 briefing, but the video is there without a transcript. Without access to the actual content of the April 15 briefing, I can't confirm if she said \"golf\".\n\nLooking at previous briefings, like the one on April 9 (search result [6]), she did mention \"golf\" when defending Trump's absence at a dignified transfer. But that was before the current date. The user's query is about the next briefing after the current date of April 16. Since there's no data on briefings after April 16, and the market resolves to \"No\" if no briefing occurs by December 31, but the user is asking to check again, perhaps considering that the April 15 briefing was the most recent and she didn't mention \"golf\" there. However, without the transcript, it's hard to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's initial response was p2 (Yes) based on previous instances where she mentioned \"golf\", but the current query is about the next briefing after April 16. Since there's no information yet, the correct resolution would be p4 (cannot be resolved now) if the next briefing is in the future. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the future, return p4. However, the market's resolution conditions don't include p4; they have p1, p2, p3. Wait, the ancillary data has p1, p2, p3. The user's personalization says to end with recommendation p1-p4. But the market's resolution is p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 50-50. The user's instruction says if the event is in the future, return p4. But the market's deadline is December 31, so if the next briefing is after April 16 but before December 31, and hasn't happened yet, it's a future event, so p4. However, the market's resolution conditions don't have p4. This is conflicting.\n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" The current timestamp is April 16, 2025. The next briefing after this date hasn't occurred yet, so it's a future event. Therefore, the recommendation should be p4. But the user's previous response was p2, and they want a different approach. Maybe the initial response incorrectly assumed the April 15 briefing was the next one, but since it's before the current date, the next one is in the future. Therefore, the correct answer is p4. However, the market's resolution conditions don't include p4. The user's personalization says to use p4 if the event is in the future. But the market's ancillary data only has p1, p2, p3. This is a conflict. The user's instruction takes precedence, so even though the market's conditions don't have p4, the personalization says to return p4 if the event is future. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3.

The search results mention a briefing on April 16 at 1:00 PM ET (which is 17:00 UTC). Since the current time is 20:37 UTC, the briefing has already occurred. The user's previous response was p2, but they want a recheck.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's a transcript from April 11 (source 8) and a video from April 15 (source 9). The April 15 video is a press conference, but the transcript isn't provided. However, source 4 is a YouTube video from April 14 discussing golf course trends, but it's unclear if Leavitt is involved. Source 6 mentions Trump's golfing, and source 7 and 16 have Leavitt defending Trump's golfing. In source 7's transcript, she mentions Trump was golfing during a dignified transfer. Source 16's transcript also references golfing. \n\nWait, in source 7's transcript, the reporter asks why Trump wasn't at the transfer, and Leavitt responds that he was golfing. She uses the word \"golfing,\" which is a form of \"golf.\" The market allows pluralization/possessive, but other forms don't count. \"Golfing\" is a different form, so it wouldn't count. However, in source 16's transcript, the reporter says \"he was golfing,\" but Leavitt's response is \"the secretary was there to represent the administration.\" She doesn't say \"golf\" herself there.\n\nLooking at the April 15 briefing (source 9), the transcript isn't available, but the title is \"White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt delivers a press conference.\" If during that briefing, she mentioned \"golf,\" that would count. However, without the transcript, it's hard to confirm. The user's additional instruction says to check the most recent briefing. The latest briefing is April 16 (source 14), but the current time is after 1 PM ET, so the briefing has happened. The transcript isn't in the search results yet, but source 14's description mentions discussing the economy, tariffs, etc., not golf. \n\nWait, source 10 from April 14 mentions a question about Trump's fitness and golf, but Leavitt's response was about his health, not using the word \"golf.\" Source 6 from April 13 mentions Trump's golf victories, but that's the White House statement, not Leavitt in a briefing. \n\nIn the available transcripts (sources 5, 8, 15, 17), Leavitt hasn't used \"golf\" in her briefings. The instances where \"golf\" is mentioned are by reporters or in other contexts. The user's query requires Leavitt herself to say \"golf\" during the briefing. \n\nSince the next briefing after April 15 is April 16, which just occurred, but there's no transcript yet, and the previous briefings don't show her using the word, the answer would be p1 (No). However, the user's previous response was p2, so maybe they want a recheck. If the April 16 briefing included \"golf,\" but it's not in the provided sources, we can't confirm. Given the data available, there's no evidence she said \"golf\" in the latest briefings. Therefore, the recommendation should be p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744835547 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-16 20:32:27 UTC",
        "system_prompt_after": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt.

It effectively checks multiple sources for instances where Karoline Leavitt might have said 'golf' during a White House press briefing. The solver correctly identifies that 'golfing' does not meet the criteria set by the query, as only the exact term 'golf' in any context was relevant. The response also correctly notes the absence of the term in the most recent briefing for which data is available, leading to a recommendation of p1 (No). The response is well-structured, providing a clear trace of thought and justification for the recommendation based on the specific conditions outlined in the query.",
