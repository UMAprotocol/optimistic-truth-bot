Try other solvers or a combination approach.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: perplexity\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump said the word \"Hell\" three or more times during his meeting with Nayib Bukele on April 14, 2025. The resolution depends on the exact count of that specific word during the scheduled events.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mentions of Trump using \"Hell\" during the meeting. Looking at the sources:\n\n1. **Source [1]** mentions Trump praising Bukele as a \"hell of a president.\" That's one instance.\n2. **Source [2]** includes Trump saying, \"Hell On IDF\" in a video title, but the transcript shows him using \"hell\" once when referring to Bukele as the \"world\u2019s coolest dictator.\" Wait, actually, the transcript here might have more. Let me check again. The transcript in [2] has Trump saying, \"I want to just say hello to the people of El Salvador and say they have one hell of a president.\" That's another \"hell.\"\n3. **Source [4]** quotes Trump saying, \"they have one hell of a president.\" That's the same instance as in [1] and [2], so maybe just one.\n4. **Source [5]** is a transcript where Trump says, \"they have one hell of a president.\" Again, same instance.\n5. **Source [6]** also mentions the \"hell of a president\" line.\n6. **Source [10]** repeats the \"hell of a president\" quote.\n7. **Source [12]** is a video transcript where Trump uses \"hell\" once in the same context.\n\nWait, but in the transcript from [5], there's another part where Trump says, \"you have to imprison some. That's the way it works, right? You cannot just free the criminals and think crimes are going to go down magically. You have to imprison them, so you can liberate 350 million Americans that are asking for the end of crime and the end of terrorists.\" No \"hell\" there. Then later, Trump mentions \"Hell\" when talking about Iran: \"you would have never had October 7th in Israel the attack by Hamas because Iran was broke they were stone cold broke when I was president and I don't want to do that i want them to be a rich great nation the only thing is one thing simple it's really simple they can't have a nuclear weapon and they got to go fast because they're fairly close to having one and they...\" Wait, no \"hell\" there either.\n\nLooking at [13], which is about Trump's past use of \"fight like Hell,\" but that's from 2024, not relevant here.\n\nSo, from all the sources, the only instance of Trump saying \"hell\" is the \"one hell of a president\" comment. That's once. The user needs three instances. Are there other mentions?\n\nWait, in [4], Trump is quoted as saying, \"you have one hell of a president,\" and Bukele responds, \"I miss you already, President T.\" Only one \"hell\" there.\n\nIn [10], the same quote appears again. So, all sources point to Trump using \"hell\" once during the event. Therefore, the count is less than three. The market should resolve to \"No,\" which is p1. But I need to make sure there aren't other instances I missed. Let me check all sources again.\n\nLooking at [5]'s full transcript: Trump says \"one hell of a president\" when greeting Bukele. Later, when discussing Iran, he says, \"you would have never had October 7th in Israel the attack by Hamas because Iran was broke they were stone cold broke when I was president...\" No \"hell\" there. Then, when a reporter asks about a mistakenly deported man, Trump deflects, and Bukele says, \"How can I smuggle him into the United States? Of course I'm not going to do it. It's like the question is preposterous.\" No \"hell\" in that exchange.\n\nAnother part of the transcript in [5] has Trump saying, \"Why don't you just say, 'Isn't it wonderful that we're keeping criminals out of our country?' Why can't you just say that?\" No \"hell\" there.\n\nIn [12], the video transcript, Trump uses \"hell\" once in the \"hell of a president\" line. No other instances.\n\nSo, only one occurrence of \"hell.\" Therefore, the answer is \"No,\" corresponding to p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744832587 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-16 19:43:07 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump said the word \"Hell\" three or more times during his meeting with Nayib Bukele on April 14, 2025. The resolution depends on the exact count of that specific word during the scheduled events.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mentions of Trump using \"Hell\" during the meeting. Looking at the sources:\n\n1. **Source [1]** mentions Trump praising Bukele as a \"hell of a president.\" That's one instance.\n2. **Source [2]** includes Trump saying, \"Hell On IDF\" in a video title, but the transcript shows him using \"hell\" once when referring to Bukele as the \"world\u2019s coolest dictator.\" Wait, actually, the transcript here might have more. Let me check again. The transcript in [2] has Trump saying, \"I want to just say hello to the people of El Salvador and say they have one hell of a president.\" That's another \"hell.\"\n3. **Source [4]** quotes Trump saying, \"they have one hell of a president.\" That's the same instance as in [1] and [2], so maybe just one.\n4. **Source [5]** is a transcript where Trump says, \"they have one hell of a president.\" Again, same instance.\n5. **Source [6]** also mentions the \"hell of a president\" line.\n6. **Source [10]** repeats the \"hell of a president\" quote.\n7. **Source [12]** is a video transcript where Trump uses \"hell\" once in the same context.\n\nWait, but in the transcript from [5], there's another part where Trump says, \"you have to imprison some. That's the way it works, right? You cannot just free the criminals and think crimes are going to go down magically. You have to imprison them, so you can liberate 350 million Americans that are asking for the end of crime and the end of terrorists.\" No \"hell\" there. Then later, Trump mentions \"Hell\" when talking about Iran: \"you would have never had October 7th in Israel the attack by Hamas because Iran was broke they were stone cold broke when I was president and I don't want to do that i want them to be a rich great nation the only thing is one thing simple it's really simple they can't have a nuclear weapon and they got to go fast because they're fairly close to having one and they...\" Wait, no \"hell\" there either.\n\nLooking at [13], which is about Trump's past use of \"fight like Hell,\" but that's from 2024, not relevant here.\n\nSo, from all the sources, the only instance of Trump saying \"hell\" is the \"one hell of a president\" comment.

Are there other mentions?\n\nWait, in [4], Trump is quoted as saying, \"you have one hell of a president,\" and Bukele responds, \"I miss you already, President T.\" Only one \"hell\" there.\n\nIn [10], the same quote appears again. So, all sources point to Trump using \"hell\" once during the event. Therefore, the count is less than three. The market should resolve to \"No,\" which is p1.

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump said the word \"hell\" three or more times during his meeting with Nayib Bukele on April 14, 2025. The market resolution depends on this count, so I need to verify each instance from the provided sources.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each search result to find mentions of Trump using \"hell.\" \n\nLooking at result [1], it mentions Trump called Bukele \u201cone hell of a president.\u201d That's one instance. \n\nResult [2] also quotes Trump saying \u201cone hell of a president\u201d during the greeting. This seems like the same event as [1], so maybe a duplicate. But I need to check if these are different sources reporting the same quote. Since [1] is Mother Jones and [2] is AP, they're separate, but the quote is the same. So that's one unique instance.\n\nResult [3] from NBC Right Now includes Trump's statement: \u201cone hell of a president.\u201d Same quote again. Still counts as one occurrence.\n\nResult [4] is a video from Hindustan Times. The description mentions the meeting but doesn't provide a transcript. Without the video, I can't confirm additional instances here. However, other text sources might have covered it.\n\nResult [5] is a YouTube video description. The title includes Trump's \u201cone hell of a president\u201d quote. Again, same instance.\n\nResult [6] from Le Monde quotes Trump saying \u201cone hell of a president.\u201d Same as before.\n\nResult [7] from Christian Index has the same quote. Still one instance.\n\nResult [8] from Fox News mentions Trump's \u201cone hell of a president\u201d comment. Same quote.\n\nResult [9] is another video. The transcript in the description includes Trump saying, \u201cthey have one hell of a president.\u201d Same instance.\n\nResult [10] from Fortune includes the same quote. One instance.\n\nResult [11] from Economic Times quotes Trump gushing, \u201cOne hell of a president.\u201d Same.\n\nResult [12] from Times Leader again has the \u201cone hell of a president\u201d line. Same instance.\n\nResult [13] is a video, but the description doesn't mention \"hell\" beyond what's already covered.\n\nResult [14] is about Hamas and Trump's \"hell to pay\" warning, which is unrelated to the Bukele event. So no relevant instances here.\n\nSo all the sources point to Trump using \"hell\" once during the event. The user's query asks if he said it three or more times. The ancillary data specifies that pluralization/possessive counts, but other forms don't. All instances found are the same phrase, \"one hell of a president,\" which is a single occurrence. There's no mention of Trump using \"hell\" in any other context during that meeting. \n\nI need to check if any source mentions additional uses.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744832587 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-16 19:43:07 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please re-evaluate the sources and check for any additional instances of the word 'hell' or consider if there are any nuances or additional contexts in the event that were not captured in the initial analysis.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump said the word \"hell\" three or more times during his meeting with Nayib Bukele on April 14, 2025. The market resolution depends on this count, so I need to verify each instance from the provided sources.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each search result to find mentions of Trump using \"hell.\" \n\nLooking at result [1], it mentions Trump called Bukele \u201cone hell of a president.\u201d That's one instance. \n\nResult [2] also quotes Trump saying \u201cone hell of a president\u201d during the greeting. This seems like the same event as [1], so maybe a duplicate. But I need to check if these are different sources reporting the same quote. Since [1] is Mother Jones and [2] is AP, they're separate, but the quote is the same. So that's one unique instance.\n\nResult [3] from NBC Right Now includes Trump's statement: \u201cone hell of a president.\u201d Same quote again. Still counts as one occurrence.\n\nResult [4] is a video from Hindustan Times. The description mentions the meeting but doesn't provide a transcript. Without the video, I can't confirm additional instances here. However, other text sources might have covered it.\n\nResult [5] is a YouTube video description. The title includes Trump's \u201cone hell of a president\u201d quote. Again, same instance.\n\nResult [6] from Le Monde quotes Trump saying \u201cone hell of a president.\u201d Same as before.\n\nResult [7] from Christian Index has the same quote. Still one instance.\n\nResult [8] from Fox News mentions Trump's \u201cone hell of a president\u201d comment. Same quote.\n\nResult [9] is another video. The transcript in the description includes Trump saying, \u201cthey have one hell of a president.\u201d Same instance.\n\nResult [10] from Fortune includes the same quote. One instance.\n\nResult [11] from Economic Times quotes Trump gushing, \u201cOne hell of a president.\u201d Same.\n\nResult [12] from Times Leader again has the \u201cone hell of a president\u201d line. Same instance.\n\nResult [13] is a video, but the description doesn't mention \"hell\" beyond what's already covered.\n\nResult [14] is about Hamas and Trump's \"hell to pay\" warning, which is unrelated to the Bukele event. So no relevant instances here.\n\nSo all the sources point to Trump using \"hell\" once during the event. The user's query asks if he said it three or more times. The ancillary data specifies that pluralization/possessive counts, but other forms don't. All instances found are the same phrase, \"one hell of a president,\" which is a single occurrence. There's no mention of Trump using \"hell\" in any other context during that meeting. \n\nI need to check if any source mentions additional uses. For example, in the transcript from result [9], the full remarks might have more, but the provided text doesn't show it. The user provided a URL in the query, but the sources don't include the actual video. Without access to the video, I can only rely on the text sources provided, which all report the same single instance. \n\nTherefore, the count is one, which is less than three. The market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). The user also asked to re-evaluate for any nuances or additional contexts. After reviewing all sources, there's no evidence of more uses. Hence, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.995, ID: 109901966977228320509456793646023888618807650938641333467056634723753963582971, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.005, ID: 28345467434865979213489730986932698773311414331348177838262403673399391588697, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The user wants to know if Trump said \"Hell\" three or more times during his meeting with Bukele on April 14, 2025. The market resolves to Yes (p2) if he did, No (p1) otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check all the provided search results for mentions of Trump using the word \"hell\" during that specific event. The key sources here are the articles and videos from April 14 and 15, 2025.\n\nLooking at the search results:\n\n1. **Source [1] (Fox News)**: Mentions Trump saying \"one hell of a president\" during the Oval Office meeting. That's one instance.\n2. **Source [2] (Mother Jones)**: Also reports Trump calling Bukele \u201cone hell of a president.\u201d Confirms the same instance as source [1].\n3. **Source [3] (AP)**: Quotes Trump saying \"one hell of a president.\" Same instance again.\n4. **Source [6] (YouTube)**: The video's description mentions Trump praising Bukele as the \u201cworld\u2019s coolest dictator\u201d but doesn't add new \"hell\" instances.\n5. **Source [9] (Star Tribune)**: Repeats the \"one hell of a president\" line.\n6. **Source [11] (NBC Right Now)**: Again, \"hell of a president.\"\n7. **Source [12] (AJC)**: Same quote.\n8. **Source [13] (New Indian Express)**: Repeats the same phrase.\n\nAll these sources reference the same single instance where Trump used \"hell\" in the phrase \"one hell of a president.\" There's no mention of Trump using \"hell\" additional times during that event. \n\nThe user also asked to check for any nuances or additional contexts. The search results don't indicate any other uses of \"hell\" by Trump during the Bukele visit. The other instances of \"hell\" in sources [4], [5], [7], [8], and [10] relate to different events, like Trump's comments on Hamas, which are outside the scope of the April 14 meeting.\n\nSince the market resolution depends on the specific event on April 14, and only one instance of \"hell\" is confirmed across all relevant sources, the answer should be No (p1). There's no evidence of three or more uses. Also, the event wasn't canceled, so it doesn't default to No for that reason.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.995, ID: 109901966977228320509456793646023888618807650938641333467056634723753963582971, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.005, ID: 28345467434865979213489730986932698773311414331348177838262403673399391588697, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Let's look through each relevant source.\n\nLooking at source [1], it mentions Trump called Bukele \u201cone hell of a president.\u201d That's one instance. Source [2] also quotes Trump saying the same phrase. Source [3] repeats the quote. Source [7] has Trump saying \u201cone hell of a president\u201d again. Source [8] includes a transcript where Trump says, \u201cthey have one hell of a president.\u201d Source [11] from the White House website also has Trump using the phrase. Source [15] again quotes Trump with the same line.\n\nWait, but all these instances are the same phrase: \u201cone hell of a president.\u201d So that's one occurrence. Are there other instances where Trump used \"hell\" in the event?\n\nLooking at source [5], the New York Post video transcript isn't provided, but the title mentions Trump's full sit-down. The description says Trump called Bukele \u201cone hell of a president.\u201d Source [12] from Hindustan Times mentions Trump's praise but doesn't add new instances. Source [13] is about Jack Smith's court filing, unrelated. Source [14] is about Steve Bannon's transcript, not relevant here.\n\nSource [15], the AP article, quotes Trump saying \u201cone hell of a president\u201d once. All other sources repeat the same instance. So, based on the provided data, Trump used \"hell\" once in the phrase \u201cone hell of a president\u201d during the event. There's no mention of him using it three or more times. Therefore, the answer should resolve to \"No\" (p1). But wait, let me double-check if any other instances are mentioned. \n\nIn source [15], during the press conference, Trump also says, \u201cWhat they did was a sin, and you're helping us. We appreciate it.\u201d No \"hell\" there. Another part where he mentions \"the hard drive from hell\" is from a different context (source [14]), but that's not part of the Bukele meeting. \n\nAll sources only mention the single instance of \"hell.\" Therefore, the count is one, which is less than three.

The user wants to know if Trump said \"Hell\" three or more times during his meeting with Bukele on April 14, 2025. The resolution depends on video evidence from the scheduled events.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The key sources here are the transcripts and articles about the meeting. Let's look through each relevant source.\n\nLooking at source [1], it mentions Trump called Bukele \u201cone hell of a president.\u201d That's one instance. Source [2] also quotes Trump saying the same phrase. Source [3] repeats the quote. Source [7] has Trump saying \u201cone hell of a president\u201d again. Source [8] includes a transcript where Trump says, \u201cthey have one hell of a president.\u201d Source [11] from the White House website also has Trump using the phrase. Source [15] again quotes Trump with the same line.\n\nWait, but all these instances are the same phrase: \u201cone hell of a president.\u201d So that's one occurrence. Are there other instances where Trump used \"hell\" in the event?\n\nLooking at source [5], the New York Post video transcript isn't provided, but the title mentions Trump's full sit-down. The description says Trump called Bukele \u201cone hell of a president.\u201d Source [12] from Hindustan Times mentions Trump's praise but doesn't add new instances. Source [13] is about Jack Smith's court filing, unrelated. Source [14] is about Steve Bannon's transcript, not relevant here.\n\nSource [15], the AP article, quotes Trump saying \u201cone hell of a president\u201d once. All other sources repeat the same instance. So, based on the provided data, Trump used \"hell\" once in the phrase \u201cone hell of a president\u201d during the event. There's no mention of him using it three or more times. Therefore, the answer should resolve to \"No\" (p1). But wait, let me double-check if any other instances are mentioned. \n\nIn source [15], during the press conference, Trump also says, \u201cWhat they did was a sin, and you're helping us. We appreciate it.\u201d No \"hell\" there. Another part where he mentions \"the hard drive from hell\" is from a different context (source [14]), but that's not part of the Bukele meeting. \n\nAll sources only mention the single instance of \"hell.\" Therefore, the count is one, which is less than three. The market should resolve to \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.995, ID: 109901966977228320509456793646023888618807650938641333467056634723753963582971, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.005, ID: 28345467434865979213489730986932698773311414331348177838262403673399391588697, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

The market resolution depends on this count. \n\nFirst, I need to review all the provided search results to find instances where Trump used the word \"Hell.\" The key sources here are the transcripts and news articles covering the event. \n\nLooking at source [1], there's a quote from Trump: \u201cI want to just say hello to the people of El Salvador and say they have one hell of a president.\u201d That's one instance. \n\nSource [4] mentions Trump saying, \u201cthey have one hell of a president,\u201d which matches the first instance. \n\nSource [9] includes a transcript where Trump says, \u201cthey have one hell of a president.\u201d Again, the same quote. \n\nSource [10] (Rev transcript) has Trump stating, \u201cthey have one hell of a president.\u201d That's the same first instance. \n\nSource [14] from the White House YouTube channel quotes Trump: \u201cthey have one hell of a president.\u201d So that's the first \"Hell.\"\n\nNow, looking for additional instances. Source [1] also mentions Trump saying, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to build five more places,\u201d referring to prisons, but no \"Hell\" there. \n\nIn source [9], during the transcript, Trump talks about Biden: \u201cwho had no idea what the hell he was doing.\u201d That's a second instance. \n\nChecking source [13], the transcript includes Trump saying, \u201cwho had no idea what the hell he was doing.\u201d Confirming the second use. \n\nAre there more? Let's check source [10] again. In the Rev transcript, Trump says, \u201cwho had no idea what the hell he was doing.\u201d That's the second \"Hell.\" \n\nIs there a third? Let me go through each source again. Source [1] only has the first. Source [4] only the first. Source [9] has two: the first and the second. Source [10] same as [9]. Source [13] same. \n\nWait, in source [9], there's another part where Trump says, \u201cWhat he did to our country is just unbelievable. So we're straightening it out. We're getting them out....\u201d No \"Hell\" there. \n\nLooking at source [7], the YouTube video title mentions \"Hell On IDF,\" but that's not Trump's statement. \n\nSource [14] only has the first instance. \n\nSo, based on the available sources, Trump used \"Hell\" twice: once in complimenting Bukele and once criticizing Biden. There's no third instance found in the provided materials. \n\nTherefore, the count is two, which is less than three. The market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). However, I need to ensure all possible instances are considered. \n\nDouble-checking source [10], the full transcript: Trump says \"one hell of a president\" and \"what the hell he was doing.\" Only two instances. No third \"Hell\" found. \n\nThus, the answer should be \"No,\" corresponding to p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your task is to analyze the provided query and decide which AI solver is best suited to handle it.\n\nAvailable solvers: code_runner\n\nSolver descriptions:\n- perplexity: Uses the Perplexity AI search engine to find information online to answer general questions. Best for:\n  * Historical data and events\n  * General knowledge questions requiring context\n  * Questions needing interpretation of complex information\n  * Has knowledge cutoff and may not have very recent information\n\n- code_runner: Executes code to fetch real-time data from specific APIs. Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Currently available data sources based on API keys:\n    - MLB (Major League Baseball) data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Will Trump say \"Hell\" 3+ times during Bukele visit on April 14?, description: Donald Trump is scheduled to participate in Bilateral Meeting and/or Press Conference events with Nayib Bukele on April 14, 2025.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Donald Trump says the listed term during his appearance at this event. Otherwise, the market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nAny usage of the term regardless of context will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nPluralization/possessive of the term will count toward the resolution of this market, however other forms will NOT count.\n\nInstances where the term is used in a compound word will count regardless of context (e.g. joyful is not a compound word for \"joy,\" however \"killjoy\" is a compounding of the words \"kill\" and \"joy\").\n\nIf this event is definitively cancelled, or otherwise is not aired by April 14, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThis market is explicitly about the scheduled Bilateral Meeting and/or Press Conference with the President of El Salvador events (https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/topic/calendar/). Speeches, events, or comments that occur outside of these scheduled events will not qualify toward this market's resolution. If the events contain a Q&A, it will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nThe resolution source will be video of the events.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe perplexity solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: perplexity\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744832587 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-16 19:43:07 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please re-evaluate the event with additional sources or updated information to address the discrepancy between the solver's recommendation and the market sentiment."

The solver identified two instances, which is factually accurate based on the provided sources. However, the recommendation to resolve the market as 'No' (p1) starkly contrasts with the market sentiment, which strongly favors a 'Yes' outcome with 99.5% confidence.
