      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"Elon\" or \"Musk\" during her next White House press briefing. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if she does, \"No\" otherwise. The current date is April 22, 2025, and the briefing today is at 1 PM ET. \n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a press briefing scheduled today. The search results [1], [2], [9] mention a briefing on April 22, 2025, at 1 PM ET. So the next briefing is today. Since the current time is 6:34 PM UTC, which is 2:34 PM ET, the briefing has already occurred. \n\nNow, I need to verify if Leavitt participated. The sources [1], [2], [9] confirm she held the briefing. So the event happened. \n\nNext, check if she said \"Elon\" or \"Musk\". Looking at the search results, there's a recent briefing on April 8, 2025, where she addressed questions about Elon Musk and tariffs [10], [12], [17]. In [10], during a Q&A, a reporter asked about Musk's comments, and Leavitt responded, mentioning \"Elon Musk\" directly. The transcript shows her saying, \"Elon Musk and the president's trade adviser Peter Navaro on some of these tariffs...\" which includes both \"Elon\" and \"Musk\". \n\nAdditionally, in [16], during a February 12 briefing, she mentioned Elon Musk in the context of government efficiency. However, that's an older instance. The key is today's briefing. Since the briefing just happened, the user might not have access to the video yet. But according to the resolution conditions, the source is the video. However, the provided search results don't include a transcript of today's briefing. \n\nWait, the search results include [10] and [12], which are from April 8, and [17] from April 8 as well. The latest mention of a briefing is today, April 22, but the provided context doesn't include the transcript for today. However, the user's personalization instructions say to use the provided URLs heavily. Since the search results don't include today's briefing transcript, but the event has occurred, I need to infer based on past behavior. \n\nLeavitt has a history of discussing Musk in briefings, as seen in [5], [8], [10], [12], [13], [16], [17]. Given the ongoing issues with Musk's role and recent controversies, it's plausible she mentioned him today. However, without the actual transcript, I can't be certain. \n\nBut the resolution conditions state that if the event has occurred and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome. Given her frequent mentions of Musk in past briefings, especially when discussing tariffs and trade, which were today's topics [9], [10], it's likely she mentioned \"Elon\" or \"Musk\". \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"Elon\" or \"Musk\" during her next White House press briefing. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if she does, \"No\" otherwise. The current date is April 22, 2025, and the briefing today is at 1 PM ET. \n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a press briefing scheduled today. The search results [1], [2], [9] mention a briefing on April 22, 2025, at 1 PM ET. So the next briefing is today. Since the current time is 6:34 PM UTC, which is 2:34 PM ET, the briefing has already occurred. \n\nNow, I need to verify if Leavitt participated. The sources [1], [2], [9] confirm she held the briefing. So the event happened. \n\nNext, check if she said \"Elon\" or \"Musk\". Looking at the search results, there's a recent briefing on April 8, 2025, where she addressed questions about Elon Musk and tariffs [10], [12], [17]. In [10], during a Q&A, a reporter asked about Musk's comments, and Leavitt responded, mentioning \"Elon Musk\" directly. The transcript shows her saying, \"Elon Musk and the president's trade adviser Peter Navaro on some of these tariffs...\" which includes both \"Elon\" and \"Musk\". \n\nAdditionally, in [16], during a February 12 briefing, she mentioned Elon Musk in the context of government efficiency. However, that's an older instance. The key is today's briefing. Since the briefing just happened, the user might not have access to the video yet. But according to the resolution conditions, the source is the video. However, the provided search results don't include a transcript of today's briefing. \n\nWait, the search results include [10] and [12], which are from April 8, and [17] from April 8 as well. The latest mention of a briefing is today, April 22, but the provided context doesn't include the transcript for today. However, the user's personalization instructions say to use the provided URLs heavily. Since the search results don't include today's briefing transcript, but the event has occurred, I need to infer based on past behavior. \n\nLeavitt has a history of discussing Musk in briefings, as seen in [5], [8], [10], [12], [13], [16], [17]. Given the ongoing issues with Musk's role and recent controversies, it's plausible she mentioned him today. However, without the actual transcript, I can't be certain. \n\nBut the resolution conditions state that if the event has occurred and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome. Given her frequent mentions of Musk in past briefings, especially when discussing tariffs and trade, which were today's topics [9], [10], it's likely she mentioned \"Elon\" or \"Musk\". \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.5, ID: 83546525788325616961698916308091170418969257717159941497497300935540214913657, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.5, ID: 91484333069795884475263108981329387605269010241225039589091970943831057387036, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market is relatively uncertain (YES: 0.500, NO: 0.500)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt mentioned \"Elon\" or \"Musk\" during the White House press briefing on April 22, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if she did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The current date is April 22, 2025, so the relevant briefings would be the ones from that day. Looking at the search results, there are two live briefings listed: one from Right Side Broadcasting Network [10] and another from Forbes Breaking News [11]. Both are scheduled for April 22, 2025. However, the transcripts or detailed content of these briefings aren't provided in the search results. \n\nNext, I should check if any of the provided search results include transcripts or mentions of the April 22 briefing. The search results [10] and [11] only mention that the briefings are scheduled but don't provide the actual content. Other search results, like [2], [4], [5], [12], [15], [16], [17], and [18], discuss earlier briefings where Leavitt mentioned Elon Musk, but these are from February, March, and early April 2025. \n\nThe user specifically needs evidence from the April 22 briefing. Since the search results don't include the transcript or video content from that day's briefing, I can't confirm if she said \"Elon\" or \"Musk\" during that specific event. The available information only shows past instances where she mentioned Musk, but not the April 22 briefing. \n\nAdditionally, the user's personalization instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable information is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. However, without concrete evidence from the April 22 briefing, the safest resolution is p4 (unknown/50-50). But wait, the resolution conditions here are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 0.5. Wait, the user's ancillary data says p3 is 0.5, but the instructions say if no info, default to p4. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" \n\nBut in this case, the event date is today (April 22), and the current timestamp is also April 22. The briefings are typically held between 12 PM and 3 PM ET. The current time is 18:32 UTC, which is 2:32 PM ET. So if the briefing was scheduled for 1 PM ET as per [10], it would have already occurred. However, without the transcript or video evidence in the search results, there's no way to confirm. \n\nGiven that the user provided search results up to [18], which don't include the April 22 briefing's content, and the resolution source is the video of the briefing, which isn't available here, the correct resolution would be p4. But wait, the resolution conditions in the ancillary data don't include p4. Wait, looking back, the user's ancillary data says: \"resolution_conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\" So p3 is the 50-50, but the instructions say if the event hasn't occurred yet, return p4. However, the event date is today, and the briefing time was 1 PM ET, which is before the current time (2:32 PM ET). So the event has occurred, but there's no data. \n\nIn this case, since the user's instructions say if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. Leavitt has a history of mentioning Musk in briefings, as seen in previous instances. However, without explicit evidence from April 22, it's risky to assume. The safe answer is p3 (unknown), but according to the resolution conditions, p3 is 0.5. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. If the briefing happened and there's no evidence she said it, should it be No? But without the transcript, we can't confirm. \n\nWait, the user's instructions also say: \"If no such press briefing happens by December 31, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to 'No'.\" But the briefing did happen as per [10] and [11]. However, without the transcript, we can't confirm if she mentioned the terms. Therefore, the resolution should be p3 (unknown/50-50), but the options are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 0.5. Since there's no evidence, but the event occurred, and we can't verify, the correct recommendation is p3. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable outcome might be that she didn't mention it, but without data, it's uncertain. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects to check the provided sources thoroughly. The search result [12] is a transcript from February 25, where she mentions Musk. [15] from February 25 also mentions Musk. [17] from February 12 discusses Musk. But none are from April 22. Since the April 22 briefing isn't covered in the provided sources, and the user's instructions say to use only the provided URLs, the answer must be based on the available data. Since the April 22 briefing isn't covered, and the user requires evidence from that specific briefing, the resolution is No because there's no evidence she said it. But that's assuming absence of evidence is evidence of absence, which might not be correct. However, per the market rules, if the resolution source is the video, and the video isn't provided here, but the user's instructions say to use the provided URLs, and the provided URLs don't include the April 22 transcript, then we can't confirm she said it. Therefore, the resolution should be No (p1). But wait, the market resolves to No if she didn't say it or if the briefing didn't happen. The briefing did happen, but without evidence she said the terms, it resolves to No. So the recommendation is p1: No.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt mentioned \"Elon\" or \"Musk\" during the White House press briefing on April 22, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if she did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The current date is April 22, 2025, so the relevant briefings would be the ones from that day. Looking at the search results, there are two live briefings listed: one from Right Side Broadcasting Network [10] and another from Forbes Breaking News [11]. Both are scheduled for April 22, 2025. However, the transcripts or detailed content of these briefings aren't provided in the search results. \n\nNext, I should check if any of the provided search results include transcripts or mentions of the April 22 briefing. The search results [10] and [11] only mention that the briefings are scheduled but don't provide the actual content. Other search results, like [2], [4], [5], [12], [15], [16], [17], and [18], discuss earlier briefings where Leavitt mentioned Elon Musk, but these are from February, March, and early April 2025. \n\nThe user specifically needs evidence from the April 22 briefing. Since the search results don't include the transcript or video content from that day's briefing, I can't confirm if she said \"Elon\" or \"Musk\" during that specific event. The available information only shows past instances where she mentioned Musk, but not the April 22 briefing. \n\nAdditionally, the user's personalization instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable information is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. However, without concrete evidence from the April 22 briefing, the safest resolution is p4 (unknown/50-50). But wait, the resolution conditions here are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 0.5. Wait, the user's ancillary data says p3 is 0.5, but the instructions say if no info, default to p4. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" \n\nBut in this case, the event date is today (April 22), and the current timestamp is also April 22. The briefings are typically held between 12 PM and 3 PM ET. The current time is 18:32 UTC, which is 2:32 PM ET. So if the briefing was scheduled for 1 PM ET as per [10], it would have already occurred. However, without the transcript or video evidence in the search results, there's no way to confirm. \n\nGiven that the user provided search results up to [18], which don't include the April 22 briefing's content, and the resolution source is the video of the briefing, which isn't available here, the correct resolution would be p4. But wait, the resolution conditions in the ancillary data don't include p4. Wait, looking back, the user's ancillary data says: \"resolution_conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\" So p3 is the 50-50, but the instructions say if the event hasn't occurred yet, return p4. However, the event date is today, and the briefing time was 1 PM ET, which is before the current time (2:32 PM ET). So the event has occurred, but there's no data. \n\nIn this case, since the user's instructions say if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. Leavitt has a history of mentioning Musk in briefings, as seen in previous instances. However, without explicit evidence from April 22, it's risky to assume. The safe answer is p3 (unknown), but according to the resolution conditions, p3 is 0.5. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. If the briefing happened and there's no evidence she said it, should it be No? But without the transcript, we can't confirm. \n\nWait, the user's instructions also say: \"If no such press briefing happens by December 31, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to 'No'.\" But the briefing did happen as per [10] and [11]. However, without the transcript, we can't confirm if she mentioned the terms. Therefore, the resolution should be p3 (unknown/50-50), but the options are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 0.5. Since there's no evidence, but the event occurred, and we can't verify, the correct recommendation is p3. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable outcome might be that she didn't mention it, but without data, it's uncertain. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects to check the provided sources thoroughly. The search result [12] is a transcript from February 25, where she mentions Musk. [15] from February 25 also mentions Musk. [17] from February 12 discusses Musk. But none are from April 22. Since the April 22 briefing isn't covered in the provided sources, and the user's instructions say to use only the provided URLs, the answer must be based on the available data. Since the April 22 briefing isn't covered, and the user requires evidence from that specific briefing, the resolution is No because there's no evidence she said it. But that's assuming absence of evidence is evidence of absence, which might not be correct. However, per the market rules, if the resolution source is the video, and the video isn't provided here, but the user's instructions say to use the provided URLs, and the provided URLs don't include the April 22 transcript, then we can't confirm she said it. Therefore, the resolution should be No (p1). But wait, the market resolves to No if she didn't say it or if the briefing didn't happen. The briefing did happen, but without evidence she said the terms, it resolves to No. So the recommendation is p1: No.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.5, ID: 83546525788325616961698916308091170418969257717159941497497300935540214913657, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.5, ID: 91484333069795884475263108981329387605269010241225039589091970943831057387036, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market is relatively uncertain (YES: 0.500, NO: 0.500)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
