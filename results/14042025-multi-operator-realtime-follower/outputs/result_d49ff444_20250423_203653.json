Your task is to analyze the provided query and decide which AI solver is best suited to handle it.\n\nAvailable solvers: perplexity\n\nSolver descriptions:\n- perplexity: Uses the Perplexity AI search engine to find information online to answer general questions. Best for:\n  * Historical data and events\n  * General knowledge questions requiring context\n  * Questions needing interpretation of complex information\n  * Has knowledge cutoff and may not have very recent information\n\n- code_runner: Executes code to fetch real-time data from specific APIs. Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Available Crypto Data Sources:\n    - Binance: Provides cryptocurrency price data for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies\n  * Available Sports Data Sources:\n    - Sports Data IO - MLB (baseball): MLB baseball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NBA (basketball): NBA basketball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NFL (football): NFL football scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NHL (hockey): NHL hockey scores, statistics, and game data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Philadelphia Phillies vs. New York Mets, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for April 23 at 1:10PM ET:\nIf the Philadelphia Phillies win, the market will resolve to \"Philadelphia Phillies\".\nIf the New York Mets win, the market will resolve to \"New York Mets\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to New York Mets, p2 to Philadelphia Phillies, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nRoute future queries of this type to the perplexity solver\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Philadelphia Phillies vs. New York Mets, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for April 23 at 1:10PM ET:\nIf the Philadelphia Phillies win, the market will resolve to \"Philadelphia Phillies\".\nIf the New York Mets win, the market will resolve to \"New York Mets\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to New York Mets, p2 to Philadelphia Phillies, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745439922 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-23 20:25:22 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport logging\n\n# Load API key from .env file\nload_dotenv()\nAPI_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\n\n# Constants - RESOLUTION MAPPING using internal abbreviations\nRESOLUTION_MAP = {\n    \"PHI\": \"p2\",  # Philadelphia Phillies win maps to p2\n    \"NYM\": \"p1\",  # New York Mets win maps to p1\n    \"50-50\": \"p3\",  # Tie or undetermined maps to p3\n    \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\",  # Incomplete data maps to p4\n}\n\n# Configure logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nconsole_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\nconsole_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nconsole_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\nlogger.addHandler(console_handler)\n\ndef fetch_game_data(date):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches game data for the specified date.\n\n    Args:\n        date: Game date in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\n    Returns:\n        Game data dictionary or None if not found\n    \"\"\"\n    logger.info(f\"Fetching game data for MLB games on {date}\")\n    \n    url = f\"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json/GamesByDate/{date}?key={API_KEY}\"\n    \n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        games = response.json()\n        \n        for game in games:\n            if game['HomeTeam'] == 'PHI' and game['AwayTeam'] == 'NYM':\n                return game\n            elif game['HomeTeam'] == 'NYM' and game['AwayTeam'] == 'PHI':\n                return game\n\n        logger.info(\"No matching game found for the specified teams on this date.\")\n        return None\n\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        logger.error(f\"API request failed: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef determine_resolution(game):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the resolution based on the game's status and outcome.\n\n    Args:\n        game: Game data dictionary from the GamesByDate endpoint\n\n    Returns:\n        Resolution string (p1, p2, p3, or p4)\n    \"\"\"\n    if not game:\n        logger.info(\"No game data available, returning 'Too early to resolve'\")\n        return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"Too early to resolve\"]\n\n    status = game.get(\"Status\")\n    home_team = game.get(\"HomeTeam\")\n    away_team = game.get(\"AwayTeam\")\n    home_score = game.get(\"HomeTeamRuns\")\n    away_score = game.get(\"AwayTeamRuns\")\n\n    logger.info(f\"Game status: {status}, {away_team} ({away_score}) at {home_team} ({home_score})\")\n\n    if status == \"Final\":\n        if home_score > away_score:\n            winner = home_team\n        else:\n            winner = away_team\n\n        return RESOLUTION_MAP.get(winner, \"p4\")\n    elif status in [\"Canceled\", \"Postponed\"]:\n        return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"50-50\"]\n    else:\n        return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"Too early to resolve\"]\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to query MLB game data and determine the resolution.\n    \"\"\"\n    date = \"2025-04-23\"\n    game = fetch_game_data(date)\n    resolution = determine_resolution(game)\n    print(f\"recommendation: {resolution}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p4\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful. Recommendation found: p4.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p4\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Philadelphia Phillies, Price: 0.36, ID: 59608644929352741750823880085746699797221750338666265768667006771134633754317, Winner: No\n- Token: New York Mets, Price: 0.64, ID: 96684339790365001219576660225494365744756009307752630749982762284116515485943, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to New York Mets, p2 to Philadelphia Phillies, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = New York Mets, p2 = Philadelphia Phillies\n\nInterpretation: Market slightly favors New York Mets (maps to p1 in resolution conditions), but not decisively (0.640 vs 0.360)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Philadelphia Phillies vs. New York Mets, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for April 23 at 1:10PM ET:\nIf the Philadelphia Phillies win, the market will resolve to \"Philadelphia Phillies\".\nIf the New York Mets win, the market will resolve to \"New York Mets\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to New York Mets, p2 to Philadelphia Phillies, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745439922 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-23 20:25:22 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4.

Recommendation found: p4.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p4\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Philadelphia Phillies, Price: 0.36, ID: 59608644929352741750823880085746699797221750338666265768667006771134633754317, Winner: No\n- Token: New York Mets, Price: 0.64, ID: 96684339790365001219576660225494365744756009307752630749982762284116515485943, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to New York Mets, p2 to Philadelphia Phillies, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = New York Mets, p2 = Philadelphia Phillies\n\nInterpretation: Market slightly favors New York Mets (maps to p1 in resolution conditions), but not decisively (0.640 vs 0.360)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

This is critical for reliability:\n   - Always try the proxy endpoint first\n   - If the proxy fails, fall back to the primary endpoint\n   - Use appropriate timeout values (10 seconds recommended)\n   - Include proper error handling with try/except blocks\n\nThe code should be completely self-contained and runnable with no arguments.\n\n\nHere's a complete code example that shows how to solve this type of problem:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nimport re\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport logging\n\n# Load API key from .env file\nload_dotenv()\nAPI_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\n\n# Check if API key is available\nif not API_KEY:\n    raise ValueError(\n        \"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY not found in environment variables. \"\n        \"Please add it to your .env file.\"\n    )\n\n# Constants - RESOLUTION MAPPING using internal abbreviations\nRESOLUTION_MAP = {\n    \"TOR\": \"p1\",  # Blue Jays (Home team) maps to p1\n    \"BAL\": \"p2\",  # Orioles (Away team) maps to p2\n    \"50-50\": \"p3\",  # Tie or undetermined maps to p3\n    \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\",  # Incomplete data maps to p4\n}\n\n# Sensitive data patterns to mask in logs\nSENSITIVE_PATTERNS = [\n    re.compile(r\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"Authorization\\s*:\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    # Add more patterns as needed\n]\n\nclass SensitiveDataFilter(logging.Filter):\n    def filter(self, record):\n        original_msg = record.getMessage()\n        masked_msg = original_msg\n        for pattern in SENSITIVE_PATTERNS:\n            masked_msg = pattern.sub(\"******\", masked_msg)\n        record.msg = masked_msg\n        return True\n\n# Configure logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nconsole_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\nconsole_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nconsole_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\nconsole_handler.addFilter(SensitiveDataFilter())\n\nlogger.addHandler(console_handler)\n\n\ndef get_team_abbreviation_map():\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches MLB team data and builds a mapping from full team names to API abbreviations.\n    \n    Returns:\n        Dictionary mapping full team names to API abbreviations\n    \"\"\"\n    url = f\"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json/teams?key={API_KEY}\"\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        teams = response.json()\n        # Build mapping from full team name to API abbreviation\n        return {f\"{team['City']} {team['Name']}\": team['Key'] for team in teams}\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Failed to fetch team abbreviations: {e}\")\n        return {}\n\ndef fetch_game_data(date, team1_name, team2_name, team_abbreviation_map=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches game data for the specified date and teams.\n\n    Args:\n        date: Game date in YYYY-MM-DD format\n        team1_name: First team name (full name or abbreviation)\n        team2_name: Second team name (full name or abbreviation)\n        team_abbreviation_map: Optional mapping of team names to abbreviations\n\n    Returns:\n        Game data dictionary or None if not found\n    \"\"\"\n    logger.info(f\"Fetching game data for game between {team1_name} and {team2_name} on {date}\")\n    \n    # If we don't have a team abbreviation map, try to get one\n    if team_abbreviation_map is None:\n        team_abbreviation_map = get_team_abbreviation_map()\n    \n    # Convert team names to abbreviations if needed\n    team1_api = team_abbreviation_map.get(team1_name, team1_name)\n    team2_api = team_abbreviation_map.get(team2_name, team2_name)\n    \n    logger.info(f\"Using team abbreviations: {team1_api} and {team2_api}\")\n\n    # Use the exact format from the API documentation with key as query parameter\n    url = f\"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/stats/json/BoxScoresFinal/{date}?key={API_KEY}\"\n    \n    # Mask API key in logs\n    masked_url = url.replace(API_KEY, \"******\")\n    logger.debug(f\"Using API endpoint: {masked_url}\")\n\n    try:\n        logger.debug(\"Sending API request\")\n        response = requests.get(url)\n\n        if response.status_code == 404:\n            logger.warning(\n                f\"No data found for {date}.

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Philadelphia Phillies vs. New York Mets, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for April 23 at 1:10PM ET:\nIf the Philadelphia Phillies win, the market will resolve to \"Philadelphia Phillies\".\nIf the New York Mets win, the market will resolve to \"New York Mets\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to New York Mets, p2 to Philadelphia Phillies, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.

Recommendation found: p4.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p4\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Philadelphia Phillies, Price: 0.36, ID: 59608644929352741750823880085746699797221750338666265768667006771134633754317, Winner: No\n- Token: New York Mets, Price: 0.64, ID: 96684339790365001219576660225494365744756009307752630749982762284116515485943, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to New York Mets, p2 to Philadelphia Phillies, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = New York Mets, p2 = Philadelphia Phillies\n\nInterpretation: Market slightly favors New York Mets (maps to p1 in resolution conditions), but not decisively (0.640 vs 0.360)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

This is critical for reliability:\n   - Always try the proxy endpoint first\n   - If the proxy fails, fall back to the primary endpoint\n   - Use appropriate timeout values (10 seconds recommended)\n   - Include proper error handling with try/except blocks\n\nThe code should be completely self-contained and runnable with no arguments.\n\n\nHere's a complete code example that shows how to solve this type of problem:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nimport re\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport logging\n\n# Load API key from .env file\nload_dotenv()\nAPI_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\n\n# Check if API key is available\nif not API_KEY:\n    raise ValueError(\n        \"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY not found in environment variables. \"\n        \"Please add it to your .env file.\"\n    )\n\n# Constants - RESOLUTION MAPPING using internal abbreviations\nRESOLUTION_MAP = {\n    \"TOR\": \"p1\",  # Blue Jays (Home team) maps to p1\n    \"BAL\": \"p2\",  # Orioles (Away team) maps to p2\n    \"50-50\": \"p3\",  # Tie or undetermined maps to p3\n    \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\",  # Incomplete data maps to p4\n}\n\n# Sensitive data patterns to mask in logs\nSENSITIVE_PATTERNS = [\n    re.compile(r\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"Authorization\\s*:\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    # Add more patterns as needed\n]\n\nclass SensitiveDataFilter(logging.Filter):\n    def filter(self, record):\n        original_msg = record.getMessage()\n        masked_msg = original_msg\n        for pattern in SENSITIVE_PATTERNS:\n            masked_msg = pattern.sub(\"******\", masked_msg)\n        record.msg = masked_msg\n        return True\n\n# Configure logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nconsole_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\nconsole_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nconsole_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\nconsole_handler.addFilter(SensitiveDataFilter())\n\nlogger.addHandler(console_handler)\n\n\ndef get_team_abbreviation_map():\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches MLB team data and builds a mapping from full team names to API abbreviations.\n    \n    Returns:\n        Dictionary mapping full team names to API abbreviations\n    \"\"\"\n    url = f\"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json/teams?key={API_KEY}\"\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        teams = response.json()\n        # Build mapping from full team name to API abbreviation\n        return {f\"{team['City']} {team['Name']}\": team['Key'] for team in teams}\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Failed to fetch team abbreviations: {e}\")\n        return {}\n\ndef fetch_game_data(date, team1_name, team2_name, team_abbreviation_map=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches game data for the specified date and teams.\n\n    Args:\n        date: Game date in YYYY-MM-DD format\n        team1_name: First team name (full name or abbreviation)\n        team2_name: Second team name (full name or abbreviation)\n        team_abbreviation_map: Optional mapping of team names to abbreviations\n\n    Returns:\n        Game data dictionary or None if not found\n    \"\"\"\n    logger.info(f\"Fetching game data for game between {team1_name} and {team2_name} on {date}\")\n    \n    # If we don't have a team abbreviation map, try to get one\n    if team_abbreviation_map is None:\n        team_abbreviation_map = get_team_abbreviation_map()\n    \n    # Convert team names to abbreviations if needed\n    team1_api = team_abbreviation_map.get(team1_name, team1_name)\n    team2_api = team_abbreviation_map.get(team2_name, team2_name)\n    \n    logger.info(f\"Using team abbreviations: {team1_api} and {team2_api}\")\n\n    # Use the exact format from the API documentation with key as query parameter\n    url = f\"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/stats/json/BoxScoresFinal/{date}?key={API_KEY}\"\n    \n    # Mask API key in logs\n    masked_url = url.replace(API_KEY, \"******\")\n    logger.debug(f\"Using API endpoint: {masked_url}\")\n\n    try:\n        logger.debug(\"Sending API request\")\n        response = requests.get(url)\n\n        if response.status_code == 404:\n            logger.warning(\n                f\"No data found for {date}.

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Philadelphia Phillies vs. New York Mets, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for April 23 at 1:10PM ET:\nIf the Philadelphia Phillies win, the market will resolve to \"Philadelphia Phillies\".\nIf the New York Mets win, the market will resolve to \"New York Mets\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to New York Mets, p2 to Philadelphia Phillies, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745439922 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-23 20:25:22 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4.

Where p1 corresponds to New York Mets, p2 to Philadelphia Phillies, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = New York Mets, p2 = Philadelphia Phillies\n\nInterpretation: Market slightly favors New York Mets (maps to p1 in resolution conditions), but not decisively (0.640 vs 0.360)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a prediction market for the Phillies vs. Mets game on April 23, 2025. The key points are determining if the game happened, who won, and if it was postponed or canceled.\n\nFirst, I check the current date and time: April 23, 2025, 8:28 PM UTC. The game was scheduled for 1:10 PM ET, which is 5:10 PM UTC. Since the current time is past that, the game should have already occurred.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([2], [3], [4], [5], [8]) report that the Mets won the game on April 22 with a score of 5-1. Wait, but the query is about the game on April 23. Wait, there's a confusion here. Let me check the dates again.\n\nWait, the user's query mentions the game scheduled for April 23 at 1:10 PM ET. However, the search results provided include games from April 21 and 22. For example, result [2] is from April 23 but talks about the Mets winning game two on April 22. Result [3] and [4] are from April 22 and 23, discussing the April 22 game. Result [5] (ESPN) shows a game on April 22 with the Mets winning 5-1. Result [6] is a YouTube video titled April 22 game highlights. Result [8] also discusses the April 22 game.\n\nWait, there's a discrepancy here. The user is asking about the April 23 game, but the search results provided are mostly about the April 22 game. However, looking at result [1], the box score from April 23 shows Phillies 13-11 and Mets 17-7, but that might be their season records, not the game score. Wait, the boxscore in result [1] is for April 23, but the actual game details show Phillies vs. Mets with players' stats, but the final score isn't clearly stated. Wait, the top of result [1] says \"Who will win the game? Phillies. 13-11. Mets. 17-7.\" That might be their win-loss records, not the game score. Then, looking further down, the boxscore shows players' at-bats, runs, etc., but the final score isn't explicitly mentioned. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, result [10] mentions the Phillies are 13-11 and Mets 17-7 as of April 23, which aligns with the records in result [1]. Result [10] also states that the Mets won the first two games of the series (April 21 and 22) and the third game is on April 23. Similarly, result [11] and [12] discuss the April 23 game, with the Phillies as favorites. However, the current date is April 23, 8:28 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time (1:10 PM ET, which is 5:10 PM UTC). So the game should have concluded.\n\nBut the search results don't include a direct report of the April 23 game's outcome. The latest results are from April 23 but refer to the previous games. For example, result [2] is dated April 23 but discusses the April 22 game. Similarly, result [8] is from April 23 but covers the April 22 game. The actual April 23 game's result isn't present in the provided search results. Wait, maybe the user provided incomplete data, or the game is still ongoing? But the current time is past the scheduled time.\n\nWait, perhaps the search results are from before the game on April 23. The user's current timestamp is April 23, 8:28 PM UTC, but the game was at 1:10 PM ET (5:10 PM UTC). So the game should have ended, but the provided search results don't include the outcome. However, result [1] might be the box score for the April 23 game. Let me check result [1] again.\n\nResult [1] is a box score from April 23, 2025, between Phillies and Mets. The URL says \"philadelphia-phillies-vs-new-york-mets-apr-23-2025-game-boxscore-91576\". The page shows the Phillies with a 13-11 record and Mets 17-7. The boxscore lists players' stats, but the final score isn't clearly stated. However, looking at the \"FEED\" section, it might be a live box score that hasn't been updated yet, or perhaps the game is in progress. But given the current time is 8:28 PM UTC, which is 4:28 PM ET, the game scheduled for 1:10 PM ET should have ended. However, baseball games can sometimes run long, but typically they end within 3-4 hours. If the game started at 1:10 PM ET, it should have ended by 4:10-5:10 PM ET, which is 8:10-9:10 PM UTC. The current time is 8:28 PM UTC, so the game might have just ended, but the search results provided don't include the final score.\n\nWait, but the user provided search results up to result [20], which includes some from April 23 but none explicitly stating the outcome of the April 23 game. The latest mention is in result [10], which is a prediction for the April 23 game, but it's a preview, not a result. Similarly, result [11] and [12] are previews. Result [13] is a prediction dated April 23, expecting the Mets to win. Result [14] also discusses the April 23 game as upcoming. Result [15] lists tickets for the April 23 game. Result [16] and [17] are predictions for the April 23 game. So none of the search results actually report the outcome of the April 23 game. The only possible source is result [1], which is a box score page, but the data there is unclear. The Phillies are listed with 13-11 and Mets 17-7, which are their season records, not the game score. The player stats in the box score might be from the April 23 game, but without a clear final score, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven that the user's current timestamp is after the game's scheduled time, but the provided search results don't include the actual outcome, I need to infer based on available data. However, according to the resolution conditions, if the game was canceled, it resolves 50-50. If postponed, it remains open. But the user's query states the game was scheduled for April 23, and the current date is April 23, 2025, 8:28 PM UTC. If the game was played, but the result isn't in the provided sources, I might have to assume it wasn't played or the result isn't available. However, the ancillary data says if the game is canceled with no makeup, it resolves 50-50. But if the game was played, and the result isn't reported here, perhaps the user expects me to use the available data.\n\nWait, but the user provided search results that include the April 23 box score (result [1]), but the data there is confusing. The Phillies' and Mets' season records are 13-11 and 17-7, respectively. The box score shows player stats, but the runs (R) column for each player might indicate the game's score. For example, looking at the Phillies' batters, T. Turner has 0 R, B. Harper 0 R, etc. The Mets' batters might have more runs. Alternatively, the \"R\" column is runs scored by each player in the game. Adding up the runs for each team could give the final score. Let's check:\n\nFor the Phillies in result [1]:\n- T. Turner: 0 R\n- B. Harper: 0 R\n- K. Schwarber: 0 R\n- N. Castellanos: 0 R\n- J. Realmuto: 0 R\n- A. Bohm: 0 R\n- E. Sosa: 1 R\n- B. Stott: ?\n\nWait, the data is cut off in result [1], so it's incomplete. Therefore, it's impossible to determine the final score from the provided box score. \n\nGiven that the search results don't explicitly state the outcome of the April 23 game, but multiple sources ([10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [16], [17]) discuss the game as upcoming or provide predictions, it's possible that the game hasn't been played yet or the results aren't available in the provided context. However, the current timestamp is after the scheduled game time. \n\nBut according to the user's personalization instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable information is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p1 as Mets win, p2 as Phillies win, p3 as 50-50. \n\nIn the provided search results, the Mets have been winning the previous games in the series, and they have a strong home record. The predictions in results [13] and [16] favor the Mets. However, without explicit confirmation, it's risky to assume. \n\nAlternatively, if the game was indeed played on April 23 and the provided search results don't include the outcome, but the user's current time is after the game, the resolution should be based on the actual result. However, since the search results don't include the outcome, and the user hasn't provided updates, according to the instructions, if no verifiable information is available and the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. \n\nThe Mets were on a winning streak, had a strong home record, and the Phillies' pitcher Wheeler had some struggles. The Mets' Peterson was performing well. Based on the predictions, the Mets were expected to win. Therefore, the most probable outcome is Mets win (p1). \n\nBut wait, the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions in the user prompt. The conditions in the ancillary data don't specify probabilities, just the resolution options. So if the game was played but no info, we have to resolve as p3 (50-50). But the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided. \n\nWait, the exact instruction: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nSo, given that the game was scheduled for April 23, which is in the past, and no sources report the outcome, we assume the most probable outcome. The conditions in the user prompt's ancillary data don't provide probabilities, but the resolution is based on who wins. The most probable outcome, based on the Mets' strong performance in the series and home record, would be Mets win. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Where p1 corresponds to New York Mets, p2 to Philadelphia Phillies, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745439922 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-23 20:25:22 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query.

The game was scheduled for 1:10 PM ET, which is 5:10 PM UTC. Since the current time is past that, the game should have already occurred.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([2], [3], [4], [5], [8]) report that the Mets won the game on April 22 with a score of 5-1. Wait, but the query is about the game on April 23. Wait, there's a confusion here. Let me check the dates again.\n\nWait, the user's query mentions the game scheduled for April 23 at 1:10 PM ET. However, the search results provided include games from April 21 and 22. For example, result [2] is from April 23 but talks about the Mets winning game two on April 22. Result [3] and [4] are from April 22 and 23, discussing the April 22 game. Result [5] (ESPN) shows a game on April 22 with the Mets winning 5-1. Result [6] is a YouTube video titled April 22 game highlights. Result [8] also discusses the April 22 game.\n\nWait, there's a discrepancy here. The user is asking about the April 23 game, but the search results provided are mostly about the April 22 game. However, looking at result [1], the box score from April 23 shows Phillies 13-11 and Mets 17-7, but that might be their season records, not the game score. Wait, the boxscore in result [1] is for April 23, but the actual game details show Phillies vs. Mets with players' stats, but the final score isn't clearly stated. Wait, the top of result [1] says \"Who will win the game? Phillies. 13-11. Mets. 17-7.\" That might be their win-loss records, not the game score. Then, looking further down, the boxscore shows players' at-bats, runs, etc., but the final score isn't explicitly mentioned. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, result [10] mentions the Phillies are 13-11 and Mets 17-7 as of April 23, which aligns with the records in result [1]. Result [10] also states that the Mets won the first two games of the series (April 21 and 22) and the third game is on April 23. Similarly, result [11] and [12] discuss the April 23 game, with the Phillies as favorites. However, the current date is April 23, 8:28 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time (1:10 PM ET, which is 5:10 PM UTC). So the game should have concluded.\n\nBut the search results don't include a direct report of the April 23 game's outcome. The latest results are from April 23 but refer to the previous games. For example, result [2] is dated April 23 but discusses the April 22 game. Similarly, result [8] is from April 23 but covers the April 22 game. The actual April 23 game's result isn't present in the provided search results. Wait, maybe the user provided incomplete data, or the game is still ongoing? But the current time is past the scheduled time.\n\nWait, perhaps the search results are from before the game on April 23. The user's current timestamp is April 23, 8:28 PM UTC, but the game was at 1:10 PM ET (5:10 PM UTC). So the game should have ended, but the provided search results don't include the outcome. However, result [1] might be the box score for the April 23 game. Let me check result [1] again.\n\nResult [1] is a box score from April 23, 2025, between Phillies and Mets. The URL says \"philadelphia-phillies-vs-new-york-mets-apr-23-2025-game-boxscore-91576\". The page shows the Phillies with a 13-11 record and Mets 17-7. The boxscore lists players' stats, but the final score isn't clearly stated. However, looking at the \"FEED\" section, it might be a live box score that hasn't been updated yet, or perhaps the game is in progress. But given the current time is 8:28 PM UTC, which is 4:28 PM ET, the game scheduled for 1:10 PM ET should have ended. However, baseball games can sometimes run long, but typically they end within 3-4 hours. If the game started at 1:10 PM ET, it should have ended by 4:10-5:10 PM ET, which is 8:10-9:10 PM UTC. The current time is 8:28 PM UTC, so the game might have just ended, but the search results provided don't include the final score.\n\nWait, but the user provided search results up to result [20], which includes some from April 23 but none explicitly stating the outcome of the April 23 game. The latest mention is in result [10], which is a prediction for the April 23 game, but it's a preview, not a result. Similarly, result [11] and [12] are previews. Result [13] is a prediction dated April 23, expecting the Mets to win. Result [14] also discusses the April 23 game as upcoming. Result [15] lists tickets for the April 23 game. Result [16] and [17] are predictions for the April 23 game. So none of the search results actually report the outcome of the April 23 game. The only possible source is result [1], which is a box score page, but the data there is unclear. The Phillies are listed with 13-11 and Mets 17-7, which are their season records, not the game score. The player stats in the box score might be from the April 23 game, but without a clear final score, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven that the user's current timestamp is after the game's scheduled time, but the provided search results don't include the actual outcome, I need to infer based on available data. However, according to the resolution conditions, if the game was canceled, it resolves 50-50. If postponed, it remains open. But the user's query states the game was scheduled for April 23, and the current date is April 23, 2025, 8:28 PM UTC. If the game was played, but the result isn't in the provided sources, I might have to assume it wasn't played or the result isn't available. However, the ancillary data says if the game is canceled with no makeup, it resolves 50-50. But if the game was played, and the result isn't reported here, perhaps the user expects me to use the available data.\n\nWait, but the user provided search results that include the April 23 box score (result [1]), but the data there is confusing. The Phillies' and Mets' season records are 13-11 and 17-7, respectively. The box score shows player stats, but the runs (R) column for each player might indicate the game's score. For example, looking at the Phillies' batters, T. Turner has 0 R, B. Harper 0 R, etc. The Mets' batters might have more runs. Alternatively, the \"R\" column is runs scored by each player in the game. Adding up the runs for each team could give the final score. Let's check:\n\nFor the Phillies in result [1]:\n- T. Turner: 0 R\n- B. Harper: 0 R\n- K. Schwarber: 0 R\n- N. Castellanos: 0 R\n- J. Realmuto: 0 R\n- A. Bohm: 0 R\n- E. Sosa: 1 R\n- B. Stott: ?\n\nWait, the data is cut off in result [1], so it's incomplete. Therefore, it's impossible to determine the final score from the provided box score. \n\nGiven that the search results don't explicitly state the outcome of the April 23 game, but multiple sources ([10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [16], [17]) discuss the game as upcoming or provide predictions, it's possible that the game hasn't been played yet or the results aren't available in the provided context. However, the current timestamp is after the scheduled game time. \n\nBut according to the user's personalization instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable information is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p1 as Mets win, p2 as Phillies win, p3 as 50-50. \n\nIn the provided search results, the Mets have been winning the previous games in the series, and they have a strong home record. The predictions in results [13] and [16] favor the Mets. However, without explicit confirmation, it's risky to assume. \n\nAlternatively, if the game was indeed played on April 23 and the provided search results don't include the outcome, but the user's current time is after the game, the resolution should be based on the actual result. However, since the search results don't include the outcome, and the user hasn't provided updates, according to the instructions, if no verifiable information is available and the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. \n\nThe Mets were on a winning streak, had a strong home record, and the Phillies' pitcher Wheeler had some struggles. The Mets' Peterson was performing well. Based on the predictions, the Mets were expected to win. Therefore, the most probable outcome is Mets win (p1). \n\nBut wait, the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions in the user prompt. The conditions in the ancillary data don't specify probabilities, just the resolution options. So if the game was played but no info, we have to resolve as p3 (50-50). But the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided. \n\nWait, the exact instruction: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nSo, given that the game was scheduled for April 23, which is in the past, and no sources report the outcome, we assume the most probable outcome. The conditions in the user prompt's ancillary data don't provide probabilities, but the resolution is based on who wins. The most probable outcome, based on the Mets' strong performance in the series and home record, would be Mets win. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Philadelphia Phillies, Price: 0.36, ID: 59608644929352741750823880085746699797221750338666265768667006771134633754317, Winner: No\n- Token: New York Mets, Price: 0.64, ID: 96684339790365001219576660225494365744756009307752630749982762284116515485943, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to New York Mets, p2 to Philadelphia Phillies, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = New York Mets, p2 = Philadelphia Phillies\n\nInterpretation: Market slightly favors New York Mets (maps to p1 in resolution conditions), but not decisively (0.640 vs 0.360)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the outcome of the Philadelphia Phillies vs. New York Mets game scheduled for April 23, 2025, at 1:10 PM ET. The current timestamp is April 23, 2025, 8:31:52 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game has occurred and determine the result. The search results provided include multiple sources from April 23, 2025. Let's look through them.\n\nLooking at the search results, [1] is a box score from Fox Sports dated April 23, 2025, showing the Phillies (PHI) and Mets (NYM) with a score. The box score indicates that in the bottom of the 2nd inning, B. Baty hit a 2-run homer off Z. Wheeler, making the score PHI 0, NYM 2. However, this seems to be a live update during the game, not the final result. \n\nResult [13] from Fox Sports also mentions the game on April 23, 2025, with a live box score showing the Mets leading 2-0 in the 2nd inning. But again, this is mid-game data. \n\nResult [14] is a preview for the game on April 23, 2025, at 1:10 PM ET, indicating it's a future event at the time of the preview. However, the current timestamp is after the game's scheduled time, so the game should have concluded. \n\nResult [15] from ABC7 New York, dated April 23, 2025, lists the game as upcoming with probable pitchers Zack Wheeler for the Phillies and David Peterson for the Mets. This suggests the game was scheduled but not yet completed at the time of the article. \n\nWait, there's a discrepancy here. The user's current timestamp is April 23, 2025, 8:31:52 PM UTC, which is 8:31 PM UTC. The game was scheduled for 1:10 PM ET, which is 5:10 PM UTC. So the game should have ended around 8:10 PM UTC (assuming a 3-hour game). The current timestamp is 8:31 PM UTC, so the game should be over. However, the search results don't include a final score for the April 23 game. The latest results from April 23 ([1], [13], [14], [15]) are either previews or live updates, not final scores. \n\nThe other search results ([2]-[12]) are from April 21-22, 2025, covering the previous games in the series where the Mets won. But none provide the result of the April 23 game. \n\nSince the user's current time is after the game's scheduled end, but the provided search results don't include the final outcome, I need to check if there's any indication of postponement or cancellation. The ancillary data states that if the game is postponed, the market remains open, and if canceled, resolves 50-50. \n\nHowever, the search results don't mention any postponement or cancellation. The previews ([14], [15]) indicate the game was scheduled to proceed. Without verifiable information on the outcome, and given the current timestamp is after the game's scheduled time, the resolution should default to the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nBut wait, the user's personalization instructions say: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" \n\nIn this case, the event date is in the past (same day but after scheduled time), and there's no verifiable outcome. The ancillary data defines p1 as Mets win, p2 as Phillies win. The Mets were on a winning streak (6 games) and leading the series 2-0. However, without concrete evidence of the April 23 game's result, we can't assume. \n\nBut wait, result [13] shows a live update where the Mets were leading 2-0 in the 2nd inning. If the game wasn't completed, but the current timestamp is after the scheduled time, and there's no info on postponement, we might have to default. However, the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The Mets were strong at home, but without data, it's uncertain. \n\nHowever, the user's additional instruction says: \"Please provide a clearer analysis of the available data, focusing on verifying the actual outcome of the game with solid evidence. Avoid assumptions and ensure the recommendation aligns with verified facts.\"\n\nGiven that, and since there's no final score in the search results for April 23, the recommendation should be p4 (cannot be resolved) because there's no verified outcome. Even though the game was scheduled, without confirmation of the result, we can't resolve it. The live updates don't confirm the final score, and the current timestamp is after the game, but no sources provide the final result. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the outcome of the Philadelphia Phillies vs. New York Mets game scheduled for April 23, 2025, at 1:10 PM ET. The current timestamp is April 23, 2025, 8:31:52 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game has occurred and determine the result. The search results provided include multiple sources from April 23, 2025. Let's look through them.\n\nLooking at the search results, [1] is a box score from Fox Sports dated April 23, 2025, showing the Phillies (PHI) and Mets (NYM) with a score. The box score indicates that in the bottom of the 2nd inning, B. Baty hit a 2-run homer off Z. Wheeler, making the score PHI 0, NYM 2. However, this seems to be a live update during the game, not the final result. \n\nResult [13] from Fox Sports also mentions the game on April 23, 2025, with a live box score showing the Mets leading 2-0 in the 2nd inning. But again, this is mid-game data. \n\nResult [14] is a preview for the game on April 23, 2025, at 1:10 PM ET, indicating it's a future event at the time of the preview. However, the current timestamp is after the game's scheduled time, so the game should have concluded. \n\nResult [15] from ABC7 New York, dated April 23, 2025, lists the game as upcoming with probable pitchers Zack Wheeler for the Phillies and David Peterson for the Mets. This suggests the game was scheduled but not yet completed at the time of the article. \n\nWait, there's a discrepancy here. The user's current timestamp is April 23, 2025, 8:31:52 PM UTC, which is 8:31 PM UTC. The game was scheduled for 1:10 PM ET, which is 5:10 PM UTC. So the game should have ended around 8:10 PM UTC (assuming a 3-hour game). The current timestamp is 8:31 PM UTC, so the game should be over. However, the search results don't include a final score for the April 23 game. The latest results from April 23 ([1], [13], [14], [15]) are either previews or live updates, not final scores. \n\nThe other search results ([2]-[12]) are from April 21-22, 2025, covering the previous games in the series where the Mets won. But none provide the result of the April 23 game. \n\nSince the user's current time is after the game's scheduled end, but the provided search results don't include the final outcome, I need to check if there's any indication of postponement or cancellation. The ancillary data states that if the game is postponed, the market remains open, and if canceled, resolves 50-50. \n\nHowever, the search results don't mention any postponement or cancellation. The previews ([14], [15]) indicate the game was scheduled to proceed. Without verifiable information on the outcome, and given the current timestamp is after the game's scheduled time, the resolution should default to the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nBut wait, the user's personalization instructions say: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" \n\nIn this case, the event date is in the past (same day but after scheduled time), and there's no verifiable outcome. The ancillary data defines p1 as Mets win, p2 as Phillies win. The Mets were on a winning streak (6 games) and leading the series 2-0. However, without concrete evidence of the April 23 game's result, we can't assume. \n\nBut wait, result [13] shows a live update where the Mets were leading 2-0 in the 2nd inning. If the game wasn't completed, but the current timestamp is after the scheduled time, and there's no info on postponement, we might have to default. However, the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The Mets were strong at home, but without data, it's uncertain. \n\nHowever, the user's additional instruction says: \"Please provide a clearer analysis of the available data, focusing on verifying the actual outcome of the game with solid evidence. Avoid assumptions and ensure the recommendation aligns with verified facts.\"\n\nGiven that, and since there's no final score in the search results for April 23, the recommendation should be p4 (cannot be resolved) because there's no verified outcome. Even though the game was scheduled, without confirmation of the result, we can't resolve it. The live updates don't confirm the final score, and the current timestamp is after the game, but no sources provide the final result. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Philadelphia Phillies, Price: 0.36, ID: 59608644929352741750823880085746699797221750338666265768667006771134633754317, Winner: No\n- Token: New York Mets, Price: 0.64, ID: 96684339790365001219576660225494365744756009307752630749982762284116515485943, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to New York Mets, p2 to Philadelphia Phillies, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = New York Mets, p2 = Philadelphia Phillies\n\nInterpretation: Market slightly favors New York Mets (maps to p1 in resolution conditions), but not decisively (0.640 vs 0.360)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Philadelphia Phillies vs. New York Mets game scheduled for April 23 at 1:10 PM ET. The current date is April 23, 2025, 8:33 PM UTC, so the game has already taken place. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided to determine the game's outcome. Looking at the sources:\n\n- Source [1] from CBS Sports mentions the Mets defeated the Phillies 5-1 on April 22, which was a Tuesday night game. Wait, but the query is about the game on April 23. Hmm, maybe there's confusion here. Let me check the dates again. The user's query mentions the game scheduled for April 23 at 1:10 PM ET, which would be a day game. However, the search results [1], [3], [4], [7], and [8] all refer to games on April 22 (Tuesday night) and April 21. Source [5] mentions a Wednesday matinee, which would be April 23. \n\nWait, source [1] says the Mets won 5-1 on Tuesday night (April 22) and that they will go for a three-game sweep on Wednesday (April 23). So the game in question on April 23 is the third game of the series. The user's query is about the April 23 game. But the search results provided don't include information about the April 23 game. All the sources are from April 21, 22, and 23, but the April 23 sources ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [7], [8]) discuss the games on the 21st and 22nd. \n\nWait, source [5] from Elite Sports NY is dated April 23 and talks about the upcoming Wednesday matinee (April 23) game, predicting a Phillies win. But there's no actual result reported there. The other sources [1], [3], [4], [7], [8] discuss the April 22 game where the Mets won 5-1. Source [2] is a video from April 23 showing Jos\u00e9 Alvarado escaping a jam in the 9th inning, sending the game to the 10th. Wait, that seems conflicting. If the Mets won 5-1 on April 22, how is there a game on April 23 going into extra innings? Maybe there's a mix-up in the dates or the sources are mislabeled.\n\nWait, source [2] is a video titled \"Jos\u00e9 Alvarado escapes jam to force extras | 04/23/2025\" which shows Alvarado getting Lindor out in the bottom of the 9th with the winning run in scoring position, sending the game to the 10th. But according to sources [1], [3], [4], [7], the Mets won 5-1 on April 22. This suggests that the April 23 game (the one in the query) went into extra innings. However, source [5] from April 23 mentions the series finale is on Wednesday (April 23) and predicts a Phillies win, but doesn't report the actual result. \n\nThe user's query is about the game on April 23 at 1:10 PM ET. The current timestamp is April 23, 8:33 PM UTC, which is 4:33 PM ET. So the game would have concluded by now. However, the search results don't include a conclusive report on the April 23 game. Source [2] shows a highlight from the April 23 game going to the 10th inning, but we don't have the final result. Source [5] is a prediction, not a result. \n\nGiven that the user's ancillary data specifies that if the game is postponed or canceled, it resolves accordingly. Since the game was scheduled for April 23 and the current date is after that, but there's no conclusive evidence in the provided sources about the outcome, the assistant must determine if there's enough information. \n\nWait, source [2] shows the game going to the 10th inning on April 23, but the final result isn't mentioned. The other sources don't mention the April 23 game's outcome. The user's additional instructions say to avoid assumptions and ensure the recommendation aligns with verified facts. Since there's no verified result in the provided sources for the April 23 game, the assistant should check if the game was completed. \n\nHowever, the current timestamp is April 23, 8:33 PM UTC, which is 4:33 PM ET. The game was scheduled for 1:10 PM ET, so it should have ended around 4:10 PM ET. The highlight in source [2] is from the 9th inning, but without the final result. If the game went to the 10th and there's no information on who won, then the outcome isn't verifiable from the provided sources. \n\nIn this case, the assistant should recommend p4 (cannot be resolved) due to lack of verified information. However, the user's additional instructions mention that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data says p1 is Mets, p2 Phillies. If the game went to extras but no result is known, perhaps it's unresolved. But the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, without any data, it's risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the April 23 game is the same as the one reported in sources [1], [3], etc., but that's conflicting because those are dated April 22. The confusion might be due to the date formatting. For example, the game on April 22 might have been reported on April 23, leading to confusion. However, the query clearly states the game scheduled for April 23. Therefore, the provided search results don't include the outcome of the April 23 game, only the April 22 game. \n\nTherefore, since the user's query is about the April 23 game and the provided sources don't have the result, the assistant should recommend p4 (cannot resolve) due to lack of information. However, the user's additional instructions say to try again if previous response was p4. The assistant must check if any sources mention the April 23 game. Source [5] mentions the series finale on April 23 but only gives a prediction. Source [2] shows a highlight from the April 23 game but doesn't give the final score. \n\nWithout conclusive evidence, the assistant must default to p4. However, the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data defines p1 as Mets win, p2 as Phillies. If the Mets were on a winning streak and the Phillies' starter was injured, maybe the Mets are more likely. But this is an assumption. The assistant should avoid assumptions and stick to verified facts. Since there's no verified result, p4 is correct.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Looking at the sources:\n\n- Source [1] from CBS Sports mentions the Mets defeated the Phillies 5-1 on April 22, which was a Tuesday night game. Wait, but the query is about the game on April 23. Hmm, maybe there's confusion here. Let me check the dates again. The user's query mentions the game scheduled for April 23 at 1:10 PM ET, which would be a day game. However, the search results [1], [3], [4], [7], and [8] all refer to games on April 22 (Tuesday night) and April 21. Source [5] mentions a Wednesday matinee, which would be April 23. \n\nWait, source [1] says the Mets won 5-1 on Tuesday night (April 22) and that they will go for a three-game sweep on Wednesday (April 23). So the game in question on April 23 is the third game of the series. The user's query is about the April 23 game. But the search results provided don't include information about the April 23 game. All the sources are from April 21, 22, and 23, but the April 23 sources ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [7], [8]) discuss the games on the 21st and 22nd. \n\nWait, source [5] from Elite Sports NY is dated April 23 and talks about the upcoming Wednesday matinee (April 23) game, predicting a Phillies win. But there's no actual result reported there. The other sources [1], [3], [4], [7], [8] discuss the April 22 game where the Mets won 5-1. Source [2] is a video from April 23 showing Jos\u00e9 Alvarado escaping a jam in the 9th inning, sending the game to the 10th. Wait, that seems conflicting. If the Mets won 5-1 on April 22, how is there a game on April 23 going into extra innings? Maybe there's a mix-up in the dates or the sources are mislabeled.\n\nWait, source [2] is a video titled \"Jos\u00e9 Alvarado escapes jam to force extras | 04/23/2025\" which shows Alvarado getting Lindor out in the bottom of the 9th with the winning run in scoring position, sending the game to the 10th. But according to sources [1], [3], [4], [7], the Mets won 5-1 on April 22. This suggests that the April 23 game (the one in the query) went into extra innings. However, source [5] from April 23 mentions the series finale is on Wednesday (April 23) and predicts a Phillies win, but doesn't report the actual result. \n\nThe user's query is about the game on April 23 at 1:10 PM ET. The current timestamp is April 23, 8:33 PM UTC, which is 4:33 PM ET. So the game would have concluded by now. However, the search results don't include a conclusive report on the April 23 game. Source [2] shows a highlight from the April 23 game going to the 10th inning, but we don't have the final result. Source [5] is a prediction, not a result. \n\nGiven that the user's ancillary data specifies that if the game is postponed or canceled, it resolves accordingly. Since the game was scheduled for April 23 and the current date is after that, but there's no conclusive evidence in the provided sources about the outcome, the assistant must determine if there's enough information. \n\nWait, source [2] shows the game going to the 10th inning on April 23, but the final result isn't mentioned. The other sources don't mention the April 23 game's outcome. The user's additional instructions say to avoid assumptions and ensure the recommendation aligns with verified facts. Since there's no verified result in the provided sources for the April 23 game, the assistant should check if the game was completed. \n\nHowever, the current timestamp is April 23, 8:33 PM UTC, which is 4:33 PM ET. The game was scheduled for 1:10 PM ET, so it should have ended around 4:10 PM ET. The highlight in source [2] is from the 9th inning, but without the final result. If the game went to the 10th and there's no information on who won, then the outcome isn't verifiable from the provided sources. \n\nIn this case, the assistant should recommend p4 (cannot be resolved) due to lack of verified information. However, the user's additional instructions mention that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data says p1 is Mets, p2 Phillies. If the game went to extras but no result is known, perhaps it's unresolved. But the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, without any data, it's risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the April 23 game is the same as the one reported in sources [1], [3], etc., but that's conflicting because those are dated April 22. The confusion might be due to the date formatting. For example, the game on April 22 might have been reported on April 23, leading to confusion. However, the query clearly states the game scheduled for April 23. Therefore, the provided search results don't include the outcome of the April 23 game, only the April 22 game. \n\nTherefore, since the user's query is about the April 23 game and the provided sources don't have the result, the assistant should recommend p4 (cannot resolve) due to lack of information. However, the user's additional instructions say to try again if previous response was p4. The assistant must check if any sources mention the April 23 game. Source [5] mentions the series finale on April 23 but only gives a prediction. Source [2] shows a highlight from the April 23 game but doesn't give the final score. \n\nWithout conclusive evidence, the assistant must default to p4. However, the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data defines p1 as Mets win, p2 as Phillies. If the Mets were on a winning streak and the Phillies' starter was injured, maybe the Mets are more likely. But this is an assumption. The assistant should avoid assumptions and stick to verified facts. Since there's no verified result, p4 is correct.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Philadelphia Phillies, Price: 0.36, ID: 59608644929352741750823880085746699797221750338666265768667006771134633754317, Winner: No\n- Token: New York Mets, Price: 0.64, ID: 96684339790365001219576660225494365744756009307752630749982762284116515485943, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to New York Mets, p2 to Philadelphia Phillies, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = New York Mets, p2 = Philadelphia Phillies\n\nInterpretation: Market slightly favors New York Mets (maps to p1 in resolution conditions), but not decisively (0.640 vs 0.360)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Mets vs. Phillies game on April 23, 2025, at 1:10 PM ET. The resolution conditions are straightforward: if the Mets win, it's p1; Phillies win, p2; postponed stays open; canceled is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game has already happened. The current date is April 23, 2025, 8:36 PM UTC. The game was scheduled for 1:10 PM ET, which is 5:10 PM UTC. Since the current time is past that, the game should have concluded. \n\nLooking at the search results, most of them refer to the games on April 21 and 22. The April 23 game is mentioned in sources [6], [12], [13], [14], and [15]. However, the detailed box scores and recaps from sources like [6] and [14] show that the game on April 23 is still in progress or hasn't been reported yet. For example, source [6] mentions the game is \"locked in a nail-biter\" with a 2-2 score in the 8th inning. Source [14] provides a boxscore with partial data but doesn't show a final score. \n\nWait, the user's current timestamp is 2025-04-23 20:25:22 UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. However, the search results don't include a final score for the April 23 game. The latest info from [14] is a boxscore that's incomplete, and [15] is about how to watch the game, not the result. \n\nThe user's additional instructions mention checking official MLB reports or updates. Since the provided sources don't have the final result, and the game date is today, it's possible the game is still ongoing or the result hasn't been published yet in the given sources. Without verified information on the outcome, the recommendation should be p4 (insufficient data). However, the user's previous response was p4 and they want a different approach. \n\nWait, the ancillary data says if the game is postponed, it remains open. If canceled, 50-50. But the game was scheduled for today and the current time is past the start time. The search results don't confirm the outcome. However, source [14] mentions Zack Wheeler starting for the Phillies and David Peterson for the Mets, but the boxscore is incomplete. Without a final score in the provided sources, even though the game date is in the past, there's no verifiable outcome. \n\nAccording to the user's instructions, if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The Mets were on a winning streak, but without concrete data, it's risky. However, the user's additional instructions say to avoid assumptions and use verified facts. Since the sources don't confirm the April 23 game's result, the correct recommendation is p4. But the user wants to avoid p4. \n\nWait, looking again at source [6], the boxscore shows PHI 2, NYM 2 in the 8th inning. But that's not final. Source [14] has a boxscore with partial data but no final score. The game might still be in progress in the provided context. Since the current time is after the scheduled end, but the sources don't have the result, the safe answer is p4. However, the user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The Mets were favored at home, but the Phillies had Wheeler pitching. Without data, it's unclear. But the user's ancillary data says p3 is 50-50 only if canceled. Since the game was played but the result isn't in the sources, perhaps the market should resolve based on the most probable outcome. However, the instructions strictly require verified facts. Therefore, despite the user's push, the correct recommendation remains p4 due to lack of verified outcome in the provided sources.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please check additional sources for any updates on the game's outcome or status to provide a more definitive resolution. Consider verifying the game's status with official MLB reports or updates.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Mets vs. Phillies game on April 23, 2025, at 1:10 PM ET. The resolution conditions are straightforward: if the Mets win, it's p1; Phillies win, p2; postponed stays open; canceled is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game has already happened. The current date is April 23, 2025, 8:36 PM UTC. The game was scheduled for 1:10 PM ET, which is 5:10 PM UTC. Since the current time is past that, the game should have concluded. \n\nLooking at the search results, most of them refer to the games on April 21 and 22. The April 23 game is mentioned in sources [6], [12], [13], [14], and [15]. However, the detailed box scores and recaps from sources like [6] and [14] show that the game on April 23 is still in progress or hasn't been reported yet. For example, source [6] mentions the game is \"locked in a nail-biter\" with a 2-2 score in the 8th inning. Source [14] provides a boxscore with partial data but doesn't show a final score. \n\nWait, the user's current timestamp is 2025-04-23 20:25:22 UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. However, the search results don't include a final score for the April 23 game. The latest info from [14] is a boxscore that's incomplete, and [15] is about how to watch the game, not the result. \n\nThe user's additional instructions mention checking official MLB reports or updates. Since the provided sources don't have the final result, and the game date is today, it's possible the game is still ongoing or the result hasn't been published yet in the given sources. Without verified information on the outcome, the recommendation should be p4 (insufficient data). However, the user's previous response was p4 and they want a different approach. \n\nWait, the ancillary data says if the game is postponed, it remains open. If canceled, 50-50. But the game was scheduled for today and the current time is past the start time. The search results don't confirm the outcome. However, source [14] mentions Zack Wheeler starting for the Phillies and David Peterson for the Mets, but the boxscore is incomplete. Without a final score in the provided sources, even though the game date is in the past, there's no verifiable outcome. \n\nAccording to the user's instructions, if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The Mets were on a winning streak, but without concrete data, it's risky. However, the user's additional instructions say to avoid assumptions and use verified facts. Since the sources don't confirm the April 23 game's result, the correct recommendation is p4. But the user wants to avoid p4. \n\nWait, looking again at source [6], the boxscore shows PHI 2, NYM 2 in the 8th inning. But that's not final. Source [14] has a boxscore with partial data but no final score. The game might still be in progress in the provided context. Since the current time is after the scheduled end, but the sources don't have the result, the safe answer is p4. However, the user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The Mets were favored at home, but the Phillies had Wheeler pitching. Without data, it's unclear. But the user's ancillary data says p3 is 50-50 only if canceled. Since the game was played but the result isn't in the sources, perhaps the market should resolve based on the most probable outcome. However, the instructions strictly require verified facts. Therefore, despite the user's push, the correct recommendation remains p4 due to lack of verified outcome in the provided sources.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Philadelphia Phillies, Price: 0.36, ID: 59608644929352741750823880085746699797221750338666265768667006771134633754317, Winner: No\n- Token: New York Mets, Price: 0.64, ID: 96684339790365001219576660225494365744756009307752630749982762284116515485943, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to New York Mets, p2 to Philadelphia Phillies, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = New York Mets, p2 = Philadelphia Phillies\n\nInterpretation: Market slightly favors New York Mets (maps to p1 in resolution conditions), but not decisively (0.640 vs 0.360)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745439922 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-23 20:25:22 UTC",
