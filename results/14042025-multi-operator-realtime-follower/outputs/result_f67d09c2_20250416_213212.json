      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump said \"Million\" or \"Billion\" 15 or more times during his meeting with Nayib Bukele on April 14, 2025. The resolution depends on the exact count from the video of the scheduled events.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any transcripts or mentions of Trump's speech during that meeting. The key sources here are the Rev transcript [1], the YouTube videos [2][3][11], and other news articles. \n\nLooking at the Rev transcript [1], Trump mentions \"billion\" a few times. For example, he says, \"we were losing $2 billion a day\" and \"we're making $3 billion a day.\" He also mentions \"$7 trillion\" but that's \"trillion,\" not billion or million. In another part, he talks about \"over $7 trillion being invested,\" again using \"trillion.\" \n\nIn the YouTube video transcript [2], Trump again refers to \"$7 trillion\" and \"trillion\" multiple times. There's a mention of \"the largest gain in the stock market in history,\" but no specific \"million\" or \"billion\" there. The Fox News article [4] quotes Trump discussing crime rates but doesn't mention \"million\" or \"billion.\" \n\nThe CBS News article [7] and others focus on the deportation deal and prison discussions, but no mentions of the specific terms. The PBS article [10] mentions a $6 million deal, but that's from the U.S. paying El Salvador, not Trump saying it during the event. \n\nThe Ticotimes article [12] references remittances of $8.48 billion, but again, that's not from Trump's speech. The Nielsen ratings [5] talk about 36 million viewers, but that's a separate event. \n\nCrucially, in all the direct transcripts and quotes from the meeting, Trump uses \"billion\" a couple of times and \"trillion\" more frequently, but nowhere near 15 instances. The exact count from the available sources is well below 15. There's no mention of \"million\" in the relevant contexts. \n\nSince the resolution depends on the video evidence and the provided transcripts don't show 15+ uses, the answer should be \"No.\" Also, the user specified that only the scheduled events count, and there's no indication of other instances outside these.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744838495 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-16 21:21:35 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump said \"Million\" or \"Billion\" 15 or more times during his meeting with Nayib Bukele on April 14, 2025. The resolution depends on the exact count from the video of the scheduled events.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any transcripts or mentions of Trump's speech during that meeting. The key sources here are the Rev transcript [1], the YouTube videos [2][3][11], and other news articles. \n\nLooking at the Rev transcript [1], Trump mentions \"billion\" a few times. For example, he says, \"we were losing $2 billion a day\" and \"we're making $3 billion a day.\" He also mentions \"$7 trillion\" but that's \"trillion,\" not billion or million. In another part, he talks about \"over $7 trillion being invested,\" again using \"trillion.\" \n\nIn the YouTube video transcript [2], Trump again refers to \"$7 trillion\" and \"trillion\" multiple times. There's a mention of \"the largest gain in the stock market in history,\" but no specific \"million\" or \"billion\" there. The Fox News article [4] quotes Trump discussing crime rates but doesn't mention \"million\" or \"billion.\" \n\nThe CBS News article [7] and others focus on the deportation deal and prison discussions, but no mentions of the specific terms. The PBS article [10] mentions a $6 million deal, but that's from the U.S. paying El Salvador, not Trump saying it during the event. \n\nThe Ticotimes article [12] references remittances of $8.48 billion, but again, that's not from Trump's speech. The Nielsen ratings [5] talk about 36 million viewers, but that's a separate event. \n\nCrucially, in all the direct transcripts and quotes from the meeting, Trump uses \"billion\" a couple of times and \"trillion\" more frequently, but nowhere near 15 instances. The exact count from the available sources is well below 15. There's no mention of \"million\" in the relevant contexts. \n\nSince the resolution depends on the video evidence and the provided transcripts don't show 15+ uses, the answer should be \"No.\" Also, the user specified that only the scheduled events count, and there's no indication of other instances outside these. Therefore, the market resolves to \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.9955, ID: 106929176329615185391484753158235891769671630974931440006648222963092872927439, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.0045, ID: 15403827535401663349397112227090611873436534780704427732038454186755309035316, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.996 = 99.6% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The resolution depends on counting those exact terms in the specified events.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mentions of Trump using those words. Let's go through each source:\n\n1. **Source [1]**: Pool reports from the White House. The transcript mentions Trump and Bukele discussing deportations and policies. There's a mention of Bukele saying \"350 million Americans\" but that's Bukele, not Trump. No direct quotes from Trump using \"million\" or \"billion\" here.\n\n2. **Source [2]**: Politico article. Focuses on Bukele helping Trump sidestep court orders. Mentions Bukele's social media activity and prison policies. No mention of Trump using the terms.\n\n3. **Source [3]**: Fox News article. Bukele mentions \"350 million Americans\" again. Trump talks about women's sports and DEI hires. No instances of Trump saying \"million\" or \"billion.\"\n\n4. **Source [4]**: Rev.com transcript. Detailed transcript of the meeting. Trump discusses various topics, including deportations and the mistaken deportation case. He mentions \"a plane\" but no \"million\" or \"billion.\" Bukele uses \"million\" once, but Trump doesn't.\n\n5. **Source [5]**: Wikipedia on Trump's wealth. Discusses his net worth claims, including \"billion\" mentions, but these are from past years, not the April 14 event.\n\n6. **Source [6]**: YouTube video summary. Focuses on migration policies and Bukele's silence. No mention of the terms by Trump.\n\n7. **Source [7]**: NDTV archives from 2022. Irrelevant to the 2025 event.\n\n8. **Source [8]**: The Nation article. Discusses the political implications of the meeting. Quotes Bukele's \"350 million\" line again, not Trump.\n\n9. **Source [9]**: PBS fact-check on Trump's 2025 Congress address. Mentions \"billion\" in federal spending, but this is a different event.\n\n10. **Source [10]**: Finance Magnates on Bitcoin. Mentions El Salvador's Bitcoin holdings worth around $622 million and $500 million, but these are from earlier discussions, not the April 14 meeting.\n\n11. **Source [11]**: Economic Times article. States El Salvador was paid $6 million for deportees. Bukele mentions this, not Trump.\n\n12. **Source [12]**: White House transcript of Trump's March 2025 Congress speech. He mentions \"hundreds of billions\" in subsidies, but this is a different event.\n\n13. **Source [13]**: Another Economic Times article. Notes El Salvador holds Bitcoin worth around $500 million. Again, Bukele's context, not Trump's words during the meeting.\n\nAfter reviewing all sources, there's no instance where Trump used \"million\" or \"billion\" during the April 14 events. The mentions of these terms are either from Bukele, other contexts, or different events. Therefore, the count is zero, which is below the 15 required. The market should resolve to \"No\" (p1).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744838495 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-16 21:21:35 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Re-evaluate the event's coverage and verify the count of 'million' and 'billion' mentions. Consider potential sources or data that might have been overlooked in the initial analysis.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"million\" or \"billion\" 15 or more times during his meeting with Bukele on April 14, 2025. The resolution depends on counting those exact terms in the specified events.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mentions of Trump using those words. Let's go through each source:\n\n1. **Source [1]**: Pool reports from the White House. The transcript mentions Trump and Bukele discussing deportations and policies. There's a mention of Bukele saying \"350 million Americans\" but that's Bukele, not Trump. No direct quotes from Trump using \"million\" or \"billion\" here.\n\n2. **Source [2]**: Politico article. Focuses on Bukele helping Trump sidestep court orders. Mentions Bukele's social media activity and prison policies. No mention of Trump using the terms.\n\n3. **Source [3]**: Fox News article. Bukele mentions \"350 million Americans\" again. Trump talks about women's sports and DEI hires. No instances of Trump saying \"million\" or \"billion.\"\n\n4. **Source [4]**: Rev.com transcript. Detailed transcript of the meeting. Trump discusses various topics, including deportations and the mistaken deportation case. He mentions \"a plane\" but no \"million\" or \"billion.\" Bukele uses \"million\" once, but Trump doesn't.\n\n5. **Source [5]**: Wikipedia on Trump's wealth. Discusses his net worth claims, including \"billion\" mentions, but these are from past years, not the April 14 event.\n\n6. **Source [6]**: YouTube video summary. Focuses on migration policies and Bukele's silence. No mention of the terms by Trump.\n\n7. **Source [7]**: NDTV archives from 2022. Irrelevant to the 2025 event.\n\n8. **Source [8]**: The Nation article. Discusses the political implications of the meeting. Quotes Bukele's \"350 million\" line again, not Trump.\n\n9. **Source [9]**: PBS fact-check on Trump's 2025 Congress address. Mentions \"billion\" in federal spending, but this is a different event.\n\n10. **Source [10]**: Finance Magnates on Bitcoin. Mentions El Salvador's Bitcoin holdings worth around $622 million and $500 million, but these are from earlier discussions, not the April 14 meeting.\n\n11. **Source [11]**: Economic Times article. States El Salvador was paid $6 million for deportees. Bukele mentions this, not Trump.\n\n12. **Source [12]**: White House transcript of Trump's March 2025 Congress speech. He mentions \"hundreds of billions\" in subsidies, but this is a different event.\n\n13. **Source [13]**: Another Economic Times article. Notes El Salvador holds Bitcoin worth around $500 million. Again, Bukele's context, not Trump's words during the meeting.\n\nAfter reviewing all sources, there's no instance where Trump used \"million\" or \"billion\" during the April 14 events. The mentions of these terms are either from Bukele, other contexts, or different events. Therefore, the count is zero, which is below the 15 required. The market should resolve to \"No\" (p1).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.9955, ID: 106929176329615185391484753158235891769671630974931440006648222963092872927439, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.0045, ID: 15403827535401663349397112227090611873436534780704427732038454186755309035316, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.996 = 99.6% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Million\" or \"Billion\" 15 or more times during his meeting with Bukele on April 14, 2025. The resolution depends on the video of the scheduled events: the bilateral meeting and/or press conference. \n\nFirst, I need to check all the provided search results for mentions of \"million\" or \"billion\" in Trump's statements during that event. Let's go through each source.\n\nLooking at the transcripts and articles:\n\n1. **Source [1] (ABC News)**: Mentions Trump talking about sending criminals to El Salvador but no numbers like million or billion.\n2. **Source [2] (Politico)**: Quotes Trump saying \"homegrowns are next\" and discussing videos, but no financial terms.\n3. **Source [3] (YouTube transcript)**: Trump mentions \"7 trillion dollars\" being invested, but that's \"trillion,\" not million or billion.\n4. **Source [4] (AJMC)**: Talks about Medicaid cuts of $880 billion, but this is from February, not the April 14 event.\n5. **Source [5] (YouTube)**: Similar to source [3], mentions \"7 trillion\" again.\n6. **Source [7] (Cointelegraph)**: Discusses a $6 million deal for deportations. Wait, this is part of the meeting. The article states the U.S. paid $6 million to El Salvador. But is this mentioned by Trump during the event? The source says Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act and mentions the $6 million payment. However, the direct quotes from Trump in the meeting (as per sources [1], [2], [13], [14], [15]) don't include him saying \"million\" or \"billion.\"\n7. **Source [9] (Fox News)**: Bukele mentions 350 million Americans, but that's \"million.\" However, this is Bukele speaking, not Trump. The query is about Trump's usage.\n8. **Source [10] (PBS)**: Mentions the $6 million deal again, but again, not in Trump's spoken words during the event.\n9. **Source [11] (Politico)**: States the $6 million payment, but no indication Trump said it during the meeting.\n10. **Source [12] (White House transcript)**: From March 6, not the April event. Mentions billions, but not during the Bukele meeting.\n11. **Source [13] (Rev transcript)**: Full transcript of the meeting. Scanning through, Trump talks about losing $2 billion a day, now making $3 billion a day. He says \"billion\" twice here. Also mentions \"7 trillion,\" but that's \"trillion.\" Later, he mentions \"trillions of dollars\" in investments. No other instances of million or billion in his speech.\n12. **Source [14] (YouTube)**: Similar to source [13], Trump mentions $2 billion and $3 billion daily, so two uses of \"billion.\"\n13. **Source [15] (YouTube)**: Same as above, two \"billion\" mentions.\n14. **Source [16] (Virginia Business)**: Mentions rare earth minerals and tariffs but no relevant terms from Trump during the event.\n\nSo, in the actual event transcripts (sources [13], [14], [15]), Trump uses \"billion\" twice. There's also the $6 million deal mentioned in articles, but unless Trump explicitly said \"million\" during the event, those don't count. The sources don't show Trump saying \"million\" at all during the meeting. \n\nThe user's additional instructions mention re-evaluating for mentions. The key here is that the count is based on Trump's spoken words in the scheduled events. The $6 million deal is part of the agreement but not stated by Trump during the meeting. Therefore, only two instances of \"billion\" are found, which is below the 15 required. \n\nThus, the answer should be \"No,\" corresponding to p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Consider potential sources or data that might have been overlooked in the initial analysis.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Re-evaluate the sources and consider any additional information that might have been overlooked or newly available that could explain the strong market sentiment for a 'Yes' outcome.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Million\" or \"Billion\" 15 or more times during his meeting with Bukele on April 14, 2025. The resolution depends on the video of the scheduled events: the bilateral meeting and/or press conference. \n\nFirst, I need to check all the provided search results for mentions of \"million\" or \"billion\" in Trump's statements during that event. Let's go through each source.\n\nLooking at the transcripts and articles:\n\n1. **Source [1] (ABC News)**: Mentions Trump talking about sending criminals to El Salvador but no numbers like million or billion.\n2. **Source [2] (Politico)**: Quotes Trump saying \"homegrowns are next\" and discussing videos, but no financial terms.\n3. **Source [3] (YouTube transcript)**: Trump mentions \"7 trillion dollars\" being invested, but that's \"trillion,\" not million or billion.\n4. **Source [4] (AJMC)**: Talks about Medicaid cuts of $880 billion, but this is from February, not the April 14 event.\n5. **Source [5] (YouTube)**: Similar to source [3], mentions \"7 trillion\" again.\n6. **Source [7] (Cointelegraph)**: Discusses a $6 million deal for deportations. Wait, this is part of the meeting. The article states the U.S. paid $6 million to El Salvador. But is this mentioned by Trump during the event? The source says Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act and mentions the $6 million payment. However, the direct quotes from Trump in the meeting (as per sources [1], [2], [13], [14], [15]) don't include him saying \"million\" or \"billion.\"\n7. **Source [9] (Fox News)**: Bukele mentions 350 million Americans, but that's \"million.\" However, this is Bukele speaking, not Trump. The query is about Trump's usage.\n8. **Source [10] (PBS)**: Mentions the $6 million deal again, but again, not in Trump's spoken words during the event.\n9. **Source [11] (Politico)**: States the $6 million payment, but no indication Trump said it during the meeting.\n10. **Source [12] (White House transcript)**: From March 6, not the April event. Mentions billions, but not during the Bukele meeting.\n11. **Source [13] (Rev transcript)**: Full transcript of the meeting. Scanning through, Trump talks about losing $2 billion a day, now making $3 billion a day. He says \"billion\" twice here. Also mentions \"7 trillion,\" but that's \"trillion.\" Later, he mentions \"trillions of dollars\" in investments. No other instances of million or billion in his speech.\n12. **Source [14] (YouTube)**: Similar to source [13], Trump mentions $2 billion and $3 billion daily, so two uses of \"billion.\"\n13. **Source [15] (YouTube)**: Same as above, two \"billion\" mentions.\n14. **Source [16] (Virginia Business)**: Mentions rare earth minerals and tariffs but no relevant terms from Trump during the event.\n\nSo, in the actual event transcripts (sources [13], [14], [15]), Trump uses \"billion\" twice. There's also the $6 million deal mentioned in articles, but unless Trump explicitly said \"million\" during the event, those don't count. The sources don't show Trump saying \"million\" at all during the meeting. \n\nThe user's additional instructions mention re-evaluating for mentions. The key here is that the count is based on Trump's spoken words in the scheduled events. The $6 million deal is part of the agreement but not stated by Trump during the meeting. Therefore, only two instances of \"billion\" are found, which is below the 15 required. \n\nThus, the answer should be \"No,\" corresponding to p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.9955, ID: 106929176329615185391484753158235891769671630974931440006648222963092872927439, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.0045, ID: 15403827535401663349397112227090611873436534780704427732038454186755309035316, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.996 = 99.6% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this step by step. The user is asking whether Trump said \"million\" or \"billion\" 15 or more times during his events with Bukele on April 14, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if he did, \"No\" (p1) if not. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event happened on April 14. The current date is April 16, 2025, so the event is in the past. The resolution depends on the video of the events. The user provided a link to RollCall's calendar, which lists the scheduled bilateral meeting and press conference. \n\nThe key here is verifying the exact count of the words \"million\" or \"billion\" during those specific events. The instructions mention that any usage, including plural or possessive forms, counts, but other forms don't. Compound words are included if they contain the exact terms. \n\nSince the user added instructions to re-evaluate the count and consider transcription errors or overlooked sources, I need to ensure thoroughness. However, without access to the actual video or a transcript, it's challenging. The market's strong sentiment towards \"Yes\" might suggest that participants believe Trump frequently uses those terms. But as an AI, I can't access real-time data or videos post my knowledge cutoff in July 2024. \n\nGiven that the event date has passed, but there's no verifiable data provided (like a transcript or news article confirming the count), I have to follow the ancillary data. If no evidence is available, the default would be \"No\" (p1) unless the conditions state otherwise. However, the resolution conditions here have p3 as 0.5, but the instructions say if no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on the prompt. \n\nBut wait, the user's additional instructions say to consider potential nuances or indirect references. Maybe Trump used the terms in a way that's not immediately obvious. However, without concrete evidence, I can't confirm. The market resolves based on the video, which I can't analyze. \n\nSince the event occurred, but there's no accessible data to confirm the count, and the resolution source is the video which isn't provided, I can't verify. The instructions say if no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome. Given Trump's speaking style, he might use \"million\" or \"billion\" often, but without proof, the safe resolution is \"No\" (p1) as per the default. However, the market sentiment leans \"Yes\", but I must rely on verified facts. \n\nWait, the resolution conditions have p3 as 0.5, but the user's instructions say if no info, default to p4. Wait, no\u2014the original instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. Since the user's ancillary data says p1 is No, p2 Yes, p3 0.5. If no info, but the event happened, and we can't verify, then p3 would be the 50-50. But the user's additional instructions say if no verifiable info, and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome unless contradicted. \n\nBut the problem is, without any sources, how do I determine the most probable? The market's sentiment might not be a reliable indicator. The safe answer here is p4, but the original instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. However, the resolution conditions don't have a p4; p4 is for unresolved. Wait, the user's initial instructions say if the event is in the future, return p4. Since the event is in the past, but no info is available, the resolution should be based on the most probable outcome. But how to determine that? \n\nThe user's ancillary data says if the event is canceled, resolve to No. Since the event wasn't canceled, but we don't have the video, perhaps the resolution is p3 (0.5), but the user's resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5, which corresponds to unknown. However, the user's main instructions say to end with p1, p2, p3, or p4. Wait, the resolution_conditions here are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 0.5. But the final recommendation should be p1, p2, p3, or p4. The p3 here is 0.5, which might correspond to a split, but the user's instructions say if no info, default to p4. Wait, the original instructions state: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome... and the event date is in the past... assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nIn this case, without any sources, we can't infer the outcome. Therefore, the recommendation should be p4. But the user's resolution_conditions don't include p4. Wait, the user's resolution_conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 0.5. But the final recommendation must be p1, p2, p3, or p4. The p3 here is 0.5, which is a split, but the instructions say if it's unknown, resolve to p4. However, the ancillary data defines p3 as 0.5, which might mean the market resolves to 50-50, but the user's main instructions say to use p4 if unresolved. \n\nThis is confusing. The ancillary data's resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5, but the main instructions say to end with p1-p4. The user's market resolves to Yes, No, or 50-50 (p3), but according to the main instructions, if it's unknown, it's p4. However, the ancillary data defines p3 as the unknown case. So perhaps in this case, if we can't determine, we should use p3. But the main instructions say if no info, default to p4. \n\nWait, the main instructions state: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.

So the correct recommendation here is p4 because there's no verifiable information. But the user's additional instructions say to re-evaluate and consider potential errors or additional sources.

But the user's resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5. Wait, maybe the p3 in the resolution_conditions is the market's resolution for unknown, but the oracle's final recommendation should be p4. But the user's instructions say to end with p1-p4. The ancillary data's p3 is 0.5, but the main instructions say to use p4 if unresolved.

Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.9955, ID: 106929176329615185391484753158235891769671630974931440006648222963092872927439, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.0045, ID: 15403827535401663349397112227090611873436534780704427732038454186755309035316, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.996 = 99.6% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

Best for:\n  * Historical data and events\n  * General knowledge questions requiring context\n  * Questions needing interpretation of complex information\n  * Has knowledge cutoff and may not have very recent information\n\n- code_runner: Executes code to fetch real-time data from specific APIs. Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Currently available data sources based on API keys:\n    - MLB (Major League Baseball) data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Will Trump say \"Million\" or \"Billion\" 15+ times during Bukele visit on April 14?, description: Donald Trump is scheduled to participate in Bilateral Meeting and/or Press Conference events with Nayib Bukele on April 14, 2025.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Donald Trump says the listed term during his appearance at this event. Otherwise, the market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nAny usage of the term regardless of context will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nPluralization/possessive of the term will count toward the resolution of this market, however other forms will NOT count.\n\nInstances where the term is used in a compound word will count regardless of context (e.g. joyful is not a compound word for \"joy,\" however \"killjoy\" is a compounding of the words \"kill\" and \"joy\").\n\nIf this event is definitively cancelled, or otherwise is not aired by April 14, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThis market is explicitly about the scheduled Bilateral Meeting and/or Press Conference with the President of El Salvador events (https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/topic/calendar/). Speeches, events, or comments that occur outside of these scheduled events will not qualify toward this market's resolution. If the events contain a Q&A, it will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nThe resolution source will be video of the events.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe perplexity solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: perplexity\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.

It correctly identifies the lack of direct evidence (video or transcript) to verify whether Trump said 'million' or 'billion' 15+ times. The solver's decision to recommend p4 due to the absence of verifiable information aligns with the instructions for cases where the event outcome cannot be inferred. However, the response fails to align with the strong market sentiment which heavily favors a 'Yes' outcome. This discrepancy between the solver's recommendation and the market's confidence suggests a potential oversight or misinterpretation in the analysis of available data or market understanding.",
