Best for:\n  * Historical data and events\n  * General knowledge questions requiring context\n  * Questions needing interpretation of complex information\n  * Has knowledge cutoff and may not have very recent information\n\n- code_runner: Executes code to fetch real-time data from specific APIs. Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Available Crypto Data Sources:\n    - Binance: Provides cryptocurrency price data for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies\n  * Available Sports Data Sources:\n    - Sports Data IO - MLB (baseball): MLB baseball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NBA (basketball): NBA basketball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NFL (football): NFL football scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NHL (hockey): NHL hockey scores, statistics, and game data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Senators vs. Maple Leafs, description: In the upcoming NHL game, scheduled for April 22 at 7:30PM ET:\nIf the Ottawa Senators win, the market will resolve to \"Senators\".\nIf the Toronto Maple Leafs win, the market will resolve to \"Maple Leafs\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Maple Leafs, p2 to Senators, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nRoute the query to the perplexity solver for processing.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",

Making the code runnable with no arguments\n5. Handling errors gracefully\n6. Returning results in a clear format (either JSON or plaintext with a 'recommendation: X' line)\n\nFor NHL hockey data:\n- Use Sports Data IO API with the SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY from environment variables\n- Use python-dotenv to load the API key:\n  ```python\n  from dotenv import load_dotenv\n  import os\n  \n  load_dotenv()\n  api_key = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\")\n  ```\n- Extract team names and dates from the question\n- The team abbreviations for NHL are:\n  * Seattle Kraken = SEA\n  * Vegas Golden Knights = VGK\n  * Toronto Maple Leafs = TOR\n  * Boston Bruins = BOS\n  * And other standard NHL team abbreviations\n- CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: When defining RESOLUTION_MAP, you MUST use team abbreviations (not full names) as keys:\n  ```python\n  # CORRECT - Use team abbreviations as keys\n  RESOLUTION_MAP = {\n      \"VGK\": \"p1\",  # Golden Knights\n      \"SEA\": \"p2\",  # Kraken\n      \"50-50\": \"p3\",\n      \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\",\n  }\n  \n  # WRONG - Do NOT use full team names as keys\n  # RESOLUTION_MAP = {\n  #     \"Golden Knights\": \"p1\",  # Wrong!

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Senators vs. Maple Leafs, description: In the upcoming NHL game, scheduled for April 22 at 7:30PM ET:\nIf the Ottawa Senators win, the market will resolve to \"Senators\".\nIf the Toronto Maple Leafs win, the market will resolve to \"Maple Leafs\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Maple Leafs, p2 to Senators, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745376142 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-23 02:42:22 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport logging\n\n# Load environment variables\nload_dotenv()\nNHL_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\")\n\n# Constants\nRESOLUTION_MAP = {\n    \"OTT\": \"p2\",  # Ottawa Senators\n    \"TOR\": \"p1\",  # Toronto Maple Leafs\n    \"50-50\": \"p3\",\n    \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\",\n}\n\n# Configure logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\nhandler = logging.StreamHandler()\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nhandler.setFormatter(formatter)\nlogger.addHandler(handler)\n\ndef fetch_nhl_game_data(game_date, team1, team2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches NHL game data for the specified date and teams.\n    \"\"\"\n    url = f\"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nhl/scores/json/GamesByDate/{game_date}?key={NHL_API_KEY}\"\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)\n        games = response.json()\n        for game in games:\n            if (game['HomeTeam'] == team1 and game['AwayTeam'] == team2) or (game['HomeTeam'] == team2 and game['AwayTeam'] == team1):\n                return game\n        return None\n    except requests.RequestException as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Error fetching NHL game data: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef resolve_market(game):\n    \"\"\"\n    Resolves the market based on the game data.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not game:\n        return \"p4\"  # No game data available\n\n    if game['Status'] == \"Final\":\n        if game['HomeTeamScore'] > game['AwayTeamScore']:\n            winner = game['HomeTeam']\n        else:\n            winner = game['AwayTeam']\n        \n        return RESOLUTION_MAP.get(winner, \"p3\")\n    elif game['Status'] == \"Canceled\":\n        return \"p3\"  # Game canceled, resolve as 50-50\n    else:\n        return \"p4\"  # Game not final or data unavailable\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to determine the outcome of the NHL game.\n    \"\"\"\n    game_date = \"2025-04-22\"\n    team1 = \"OTT\"  # Ottawa Senators\n    team2 = \"TOR\"  # Toronto Maple Leafs\n\n    game_data = fetch_nhl_game_data(game_date, team1, team2)\n    resolution = resolve_market(game_data)\n    print(f\"recommendation: {resolution}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p4\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful. Recommendation found: p4.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p4\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Senators, Price: 0.43, ID: 21741130551586384299701772084935499474351173711350847170592342041586384963000, Winner: No\n- Token: Maple Leafs, Price: 0.57, ID: 12865965759800434502422737200218706341956146353143042988969574716346217140110, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Maple Leafs, p2 to Senators, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Maple Leafs, p2 = Senators\n\nInterpretation: Market slightly favors Maple Leafs (maps to p1 in resolution conditions), but not decisively (0.570 vs 0.430)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Senators vs. Maple Leafs, description: In the upcoming NHL game, scheduled for April 22 at 7:30PM ET:\nIf the Ottawa Senators win, the market will resolve to \"Senators\".\nIf the Toronto Maple Leafs win, the market will resolve to \"Maple Leafs\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Maple Leafs, p2 to Senators, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality.

Recommendation found: p4.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p4\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Senators, Price: 0.43, ID: 21741130551586384299701772084935499474351173711350847170592342041586384963000, Winner: No\n- Token: Maple Leafs, Price: 0.57, ID: 12865965759800434502422737200218706341956146353143042988969574716346217140110, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Maple Leafs, p2 to Senators, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Maple Leafs, p2 = Senators\n\nInterpretation: Market slightly favors Maple Leafs (maps to p1 in resolution conditions), but not decisively (0.570 vs 0.430)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

This is critical for reliability:\n   - Always try the proxy endpoint first\n   - If the proxy fails, fall back to the primary endpoint\n   - Use appropriate timeout values (10 seconds recommended)\n   - Include proper error handling with try/except blocks\n\nThe code should be completely self-contained and runnable with no arguments.\n\n\nHere's a complete code example that shows how to solve this type of problem:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nimport re\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport logging\n\n# Load API key from .env file\nload_dotenv()\nAPI_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\n\n# Check if API key is available\nif not API_KEY:\n    raise ValueError(\n        \"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY not found in environment variables. \"\n        \"Please add it to your .env file.\"\n    )\n\n# Constants - RESOLUTION MAPPING using internal abbreviations\nRESOLUTION_MAP = {\n    \"TOR\": \"p1\",  # Blue Jays (Home team) maps to p1\n    \"BAL\": \"p2\",  # Orioles (Away team) maps to p2\n    \"50-50\": \"p3\",  # Tie or undetermined maps to p3\n    \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\",  # Incomplete data maps to p4\n}\n\n# Sensitive data patterns to mask in logs\nSENSITIVE_PATTERNS = [\n    re.compile(r\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"Authorization\\s*:\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    # Add more patterns as needed\n]\n\nclass SensitiveDataFilter(logging.Filter):\n    def filter(self, record):\n        original_msg = record.getMessage()\n        masked_msg = original_msg\n        for pattern in SENSITIVE_PATTERNS:\n            masked_msg = pattern.sub(\"******\", masked_msg)\n        record.msg = masked_msg\n        return True\n\n# Configure logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nconsole_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\nconsole_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nconsole_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\nconsole_handler.addFilter(SensitiveDataFilter())\n\nlogger.addHandler(console_handler)\n\n\ndef get_team_abbreviation_map():\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches MLB team data and builds a mapping from full team names to API abbreviations.\n    \n    Returns:\n        Dictionary mapping full team names to API abbreviations\n    \"\"\"\n    url = f\"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json/teams?key={API_KEY}\"\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        teams = response.json()\n        # Build mapping from full team name to API abbreviation\n        return {f\"{team['City']} {team['Name']}\": team['Key'] for team in teams}\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Failed to fetch team abbreviations: {e}\")\n        return {}\n\ndef fetch_game_data(date, team1_name, team2_name, team_abbreviation_map=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches game data for the specified date and teams.\n\n    Args:\n        date: Game date in YYYY-MM-DD format\n        team1_name: First team name (full name or abbreviation)\n        team2_name: Second team name (full name or abbreviation)\n        team_abbreviation_map: Optional mapping of team names to abbreviations\n\n    Returns:\n        Game data dictionary or None if not found\n    \"\"\"\n    logger.info(f\"Fetching game data for game between {team1_name} and {team2_name} on {date}\")\n    \n    # If we don't have a team abbreviation map, try to get one\n    if team_abbreviation_map is None:\n        team_abbreviation_map = get_team_abbreviation_map()\n    \n    # Convert team names to abbreviations if needed\n    team1_api = team_abbreviation_map.get(team1_name, team1_name)\n    team2_api = team_abbreviation_map.get(team2_name, team2_name)\n    \n    logger.info(f\"Using team abbreviations: {team1_api} and {team2_api}\")\n\n    # Use the exact format from the API documentation with key as query parameter\n    url = f\"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/stats/json/BoxScoresFinal/{date}?key={API_KEY}\"\n    \n    # Mask API key in logs\n    masked_url = url.replace(API_KEY, \"******\")\n    logger.debug(f\"Using API endpoint: {masked_url}\")\n\n    try:\n        logger.debug(\"Sending API request\")\n        response = requests.get(url)\n\n        if response.status_code == 404:\n            logger.warning(\n                f\"No data found for {date}.

Removing all command-line argument handling\n2. Using dotenv to load API keys from environment variables\n3. Extracting required info (dates, teams, etc.) directly from the question\n4. Making the code runnable with no arguments\n5. Handling errors gracefully\n6. Returning results in a clear format (either JSON or plaintext with a 'recommendation: X' line)\n\nFor NHL hockey data:\n- Use Sports Data IO API with the SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY from environment variables\n- Use python-dotenv to load the API key:\n  ```python\n  from dotenv import load_dotenv\n  import os\n  \n  load_dotenv()\n  api_key = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\")\n  ```\n- Extract team names and dates from the question\n- The team abbreviations for NHL are:\n  * Seattle Kraken = SEA\n  * Vegas Golden Knights = VGK\n  * Toronto Maple Leafs = TOR\n  * Boston Bruins = BOS\n  * And other standard NHL team abbreviations\n- CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: When defining RESOLUTION_MAP, you MUST use team abbreviations (not full names) as keys:\n  ```python\n  # CORRECT - Use team abbreviations as keys\n  RESOLUTION_MAP = {\n      \"VGK\": \"p1\",  # Golden Knights\n      \"SEA\": \"p2\",  # Kraken\n      \"50-50\": \"p3\",\n      \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\",\n  }\n  \n  # WRONG - Do NOT use full team names as keys\n  # RESOLUTION_MAP = {\n  #     \"Golden Knights\": \"p1\",  # Wrong!

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Senators vs. Maple Leafs, description: In the upcoming NHL game, scheduled for April 22 at 7:30PM ET:\nIf the Ottawa Senators win, the market will resolve to \"Senators\".\nIf the Toronto Maple Leafs win, the market will resolve to \"Maple Leafs\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Maple Leafs, p2 to Senators, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745376142 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-23 02:42:22 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4.

Recommendation found: p4.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p4\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Senators, Price: 0.43, ID: 21741130551586384299701772084935499474351173711350847170592342041586384963000, Winner: No\n- Token: Maple Leafs, Price: 0.57, ID: 12865965759800434502422737200218706341956146353143042988969574716346217140110, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Maple Leafs, p2 to Senators, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Maple Leafs, p2 = Senators\n\nInterpretation: Market slightly favors Maple Leafs (maps to p1 in resolution conditions), but not decisively (0.570 vs 0.430)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Removing all command-line argument handling\n2. Using dotenv to load API keys from environment variables\n3. Extracting required info (dates, teams, etc.) directly from the question\n4. Making the code runnable with no arguments\n5. Handling errors gracefully\n6. Returning results in a clear format (either JSON or plaintext with a 'recommendation: X' line)\n\nFor NHL hockey data:\n- Use Sports Data IO API with the SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY from environment variables\n- Use python-dotenv to load the API key:\n  ```python\n  from dotenv import load_dotenv\n  import os\n  \n  load_dotenv()\n  api_key = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\")\n  ```\n- Extract team names and dates from the question\n- The team abbreviations for NHL are:\n  * Seattle Kraken = SEA\n  * Vegas Golden Knights = VGK\n  * Toronto Maple Leafs = TOR\n  * Boston Bruins = BOS\n  * And other standard NHL team abbreviations\n- CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: When defining RESOLUTION_MAP, you MUST use team abbreviations (not full names) as keys:\n  ```python\n  # CORRECT - Use team abbreviations as keys\n  RESOLUTION_MAP = {\n      \"VGK\": \"p1\",  # Golden Knights\n      \"SEA\": \"p2\",  # Kraken\n      \"50-50\": \"p3\",\n      \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\",\n  }\n  \n  # WRONG - Do NOT use full team names as keys\n  # RESOLUTION_MAP = {\n  #     \"Golden Knights\": \"p1\",  # Wrong!

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745376142 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-23 02:42:22 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please ensure the API key is valid and the API service is operational at the time of the query. Additionally, verify that the game data for the specified date is available and correctly formatted in the API response.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please verify the availability of the game data for the specified date and ensure the API key and service are operational.

Recommendation found: p4.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p4\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Senators, Price: 0.43, ID: 21741130551586384299701772084935499474351173711350847170592342041586384963000, Winner: No\n- Token: Maple Leafs, Price: 0.57, ID: 12865965759800434502422737200218706341956146353143042988969574716346217140110, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Maple Leafs, p2 to Senators, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Maple Leafs, p2 = Senators\n\nInterpretation: Market slightly favors Maple Leafs (maps to p1 in resolution conditions), but not decisively (0.570 vs 0.430)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Senators vs. Maple Leafs game on April 22, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Maple Leafs win, it's p1; Senators win, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and time. The current timestamp is April 23, 2025, 2:42:22 UTC, which is April 22 in Eastern Time. The game was scheduled for April 22 at 7:30 PM ET, which is 23:30 UTC. Since the current time is past that, the game should have occurred.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's conflicting info. Result [1] from ESPN shows a live score for the April 22 game with a 2-2 tie going into overtime, but the detailed stats and period summaries suggest it's a different game. However, results [2], [4], [6], [7], and [8] all describe a Game 1 on April 20 or 21 where the Maple Leafs won 6-2. Wait, there's confusion here. The user's query is about the April 22 game, but some sources mention a Game 1 on April 20 or 21. Let me check the dates again.\n\nResult [1] is labeled as April 22, 2025, and shows a 2-2 game in OT. But results [2], [4], [6], [7], [8] refer to a Game 1 on April 20 or 21 with a 6-2 Maple Leafs win. Result [3] and [5] discuss Game 2 on April 22. Wait, the playoff series has multiple games. Game 1 was on April 20, Game 2 on April 22. The user is asking about the April 22 game, which is Game 2.\n\nBut the search results are mixed. Result [1] shows a live score for April 22 with the game going into OT tied 2-2. However, result [3] is a live score for Game 2 on April 22, showing the Senators tied 2-2 in the 3rd period, and then Gaudette scoring to make it 2-2, leading to OT. The final outcome isn't clear in the search results provided. The other results [2,4,6,7,8] discuss Game 1, which the Maple Leafs won 6-2. \n\nThe key is to determine the outcome of the April 22 game (Game 2). The user provided a URL in the query, but the search results don't include a direct link to the final result of Game 2. Result [1] is from ESPN and shows the game going into OT at 2-2, but the detailed stats might be from a different game. Result [3] from Fox Sports shows the game in the 3rd period with a 2-2 tie, but no final result. The other results don't mention Game 2's outcome. \n\nSince the current date is April 23, 2025, and the game was on April 22, the event has already occurred. However, the provided search results don't explicitly state the final result of Game 2. The only info is from [1] which shows an OT summary with no goals, implying the game went to a shootout or remained tied. But NHL playoff games don't have shootouts; they continue with sudden-death overtime periods until a goal is scored. \n\nGiven that the search results don't provide a conclusive outcome for the April 22 game, but the user's ancillary data says if the game is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, the Maple Leafs were leading the series 1-0, and in Game 2, the score was tied 2-2 in OT. Without confirmation of the OT result, it's unclear. But according to the resolution conditions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The Maple Leafs were favored, but without explicit info, it's risky. However, the user's personalization says to use the provided URLs heavily. The user included a URL in the query? Wait, looking back, the user's query includes ancillary data but no URL. The search results provided include [1] which is the ESPN game page for April 22, showing the game went to OT but no final result. However, the detailed stats in [1] might be from a different game, as the period summaries mention a 6-2 score which matches Game 1. There's confusion here. \n\nWait, result [1] has conflicting info. The URL says April 22, but the period summaries show a 6-2 final score, which matches Game 1. It's possible that the ESPN page is misdated or there's a mix-up. The other results clearly state Game 1 was a 6-2 Maple Leafs win on April 20 or 21. The April 22 game (Game 2) is discussed in [3] and [5], but [3] shows it as a live score with the game going into OT tied 2-2. Without a final result in the provided search results, but the current date is past the game date, the resolution should be based on available info. \n\nSince the user's personalization instructs to use the provided URLs heavily, and the search results don't include a final score for Game 2, but the event date is in the past, the market should resolve based on the most probable outcome. However, without explicit confirmation, the safe answer is p4 (cannot be resolved). But the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The Maple Leafs were leading the series, but Game 2's outcome isn't confirmed. However, in the absence of data, perhaps the game went to OT, and the Maple Leafs won, but this is speculative. Alternatively, if the game was tied and not concluded, but the current timestamp is after the game date, it's possible the game was completed. \n\nGiven the confusion in the search results and lack of clear final score for Game 2, the recommendation would be p4, as the outcome isn't verifiable from the provided sources. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The Maple Leafs were favored, but without explicit confirmation, it's uncertain. However, the ancillary data's resolution conditions have p3 as 50-50 only if the game is canceled. Since the game was played (as per the live score in [1] and [3]), but the result isn't clear, perhaps it's unresolved. But the user's instruction says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Given the Maple Leafs' dominance in Game 1 and being the home team in Game 2, maybe assume they won. But this is a stretch. \n\nAlternatively, looking at result [5], the prediction for Game 2 expects the Maple Leafs to win, but that's a prediction, not a result. Since the search results don't confirm the outcome, and the current date is after the game, but no sources report the final result, the correct resolution is p4 (cannot be resolved at this time). However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without any sources confirming, it's not verifiable. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745376142 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-23 02:42:22 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Senators vs. Maple Leafs game on April 22, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Maple Leafs win, it's p1; Senators win, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and time. The current timestamp is April 23, 2025, 2:42:22 UTC, which is April 22 in Eastern Time. The game was scheduled for April 22 at 7:30 PM ET, which is 23:30 UTC. Since the current time is past that, the game should have occurred.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's conflicting info. Result [1] from ESPN shows a live score for the April 22 game with a 2-2 tie going into overtime, but the detailed stats and period summaries suggest it's a different game. However, results [2], [4], [6], [7], and [8] all describe a Game 1 on April 20 or 21 where the Maple Leafs won 6-2. Wait, there's confusion here. The user's query is about the April 22 game, but some sources mention a Game 1 on April 20 or 21. Let me check the dates again.\n\nResult [1] is labeled as April 22, 2025, and shows a 2-2 game in OT. But results [2], [4], [6], [7], [8] refer to a Game 1 on April 20 or 21 with a 6-2 Maple Leafs win. Result [3] and [5] discuss Game 2 on April 22. Wait, the playoff series has multiple games. Game 1 was on April 20, Game 2 on April 22. The user is asking about the April 22 game, which is Game 2.\n\nBut the search results are mixed. Result [1] shows a live score for April 22 with the game going into OT tied 2-2. However, result [3] is a live score for Game 2 on April 22, showing the Senators tied 2-2 in the 3rd period, and then Gaudette scoring to make it 2-2, leading to OT. The final outcome isn't clear in the search results provided. The other results [2,4,6,7,8] discuss Game 1, which the Maple Leafs won 6-2. \n\nThe key is to determine the outcome of the April 22 game (Game 2). The user provided a URL in the query, but the search results don't include a direct link to the final result of Game 2. Result [1] is from ESPN and shows the game going into OT at 2-2, but the detailed stats might be from a different game. Result [3] from Fox Sports shows the game in the 3rd period with a 2-2 tie, but no final result. The other results don't mention Game 2's outcome. \n\nSince the current date is April 23, 2025, and the game was on April 22, the event has already occurred. However, the provided search results don't explicitly state the final result of Game 2. The only info is from [1] which shows an OT summary with no goals, implying the game went to a shootout or remained tied. But NHL playoff games don't have shootouts; they continue with sudden-death overtime periods until a goal is scored. \n\nGiven that the search results don't provide a conclusive outcome for the April 22 game, but the user's ancillary data says if the game is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, the Maple Leafs were leading the series 1-0, and in Game 2, the score was tied 2-2 in OT. Without confirmation of the OT result, it's unclear. But according to the resolution conditions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The Maple Leafs were favored, but without explicit info, it's risky. However, the user's personalization says to use the provided URLs heavily. The user included a URL in the query? Wait, looking back, the user's query includes ancillary data but no URL. The search results provided include [1] which is the ESPN game page for April 22, showing the game went to OT but no final result. However, the detailed stats in [1] might be from a different game, as the period summaries mention a 6-2 score which matches Game 1. There's confusion here. \n\nWait, result [1] has conflicting info. The URL says April 22, but the period summaries show a 6-2 final score, which matches Game 1. It's possible that the ESPN page is misdated or there's a mix-up. The other results clearly state Game 1 was a 6-2 Maple Leafs win on April 20 or 21. The April 22 game (Game 2) is discussed in [3] and [5], but [3] shows it as a live score with the game going into OT tied 2-2. Without a final result in the provided search results, but the current date is past the game date, the resolution should be based on available info. \n\nSince the user's personalization instructs to use the provided URLs heavily, and the search results don't include a final score for Game 2, but the event date is in the past, the market should resolve based on the most probable outcome. However, without explicit confirmation, the safe answer is p4 (cannot be resolved). But the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The Maple Leafs were leading the series, but Game 2's outcome isn't confirmed. However, in the absence of data, perhaps the game went to OT, and the Maple Leafs won, but this is speculative. Alternatively, if the game was tied and not concluded, but the current timestamp is after the game date, it's possible the game was completed. \n\nGiven the confusion in the search results and lack of clear final score for Game 2, the recommendation would be p4, as the outcome isn't verifiable from the provided sources. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The Maple Leafs were favored, but without explicit confirmation, it's uncertain. However, the ancillary data's resolution conditions have p3 as 50-50 only if the game is canceled. Since the game was played (as per the live score in [1] and [3]), but the result isn't clear, perhaps it's unresolved. But the user's instruction says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Given the Maple Leafs' dominance in Game 1 and being the home team in Game 2, maybe assume they won. But this is a stretch. \n\nAlternatively, looking at result [5], the prediction for Game 2 expects the Maple Leafs to win, but that's a prediction, not a result. Since the search results don't confirm the outcome, and the current date is after the game, but no sources report the final result, the correct resolution is p4 (cannot be resolved at this time). However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without any sources confirming, it's not verifiable. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Senators, Price: 0.43, ID: 21741130551586384299701772084935499474351173711350847170592342041586384963000, Winner: No\n- Token: Maple Leafs, Price: 0.57, ID: 12865965759800434502422737200218706341956146353143042988969574716346217140110, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Maple Leafs, p2 to Senators, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Maple Leafs, p2 = Senators\n\nInterpretation: Market slightly favors Maple Leafs (maps to p1 in resolution conditions), but not decisively (0.570 vs 0.430)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

So the game has already occurred.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are multiple sources. Result [1] is the ESPN live score for the game on April 22, showing the final score as Senators 2, Maple Leafs 2 in overtime. Wait, but the table shows the final score as 2-2 with no goals in OT. However, the period summary mentions OT but no goals. But NHL playoff games can't end in a tie; they go into multiple overtimes until someone scores. This seems conflicting. Maybe the live score wasn't updated? Let me check other sources.\n\nResult [3] from Fox Sports mentions the game on April 22, 2025, and in the play-by-play, it shows the Senators scoring in the 3rd period to tie it 2-2. The OT summary in [1] says no goals, but that's only the first OT. Wait, NHL playoffs have continuous overtime periods until a goal is scored. So if the game ended 2-2, that's not possible. There must be a mistake here. Let me check other sources.\n\nResult [4] and [7] discuss Game 1 on April 20, where the Maple Leafs won 6-2. The user's query is about the game on April 22, which is Game 2. The search results include [1], [2], [3], [8] about the April 22 game. \n\nLooking at [1], the ESPN live score for April 22 game shows the final score as Senators 2, Maple Leafs 2, but that's after OT. However, NHL playoff games don't end in a tie. This must be an error in the data. Alternatively, maybe the game went into multiple overtimes and the data is incomplete. Let me check result [3] from Fox Sports. The live score there shows the game as Senators 2, Maple Leafs 2 with 5:13 left in the 3rd period, but that's during the game, not the final. Wait, the timestamp on [3] is April 22, 2025, but the current date is April 23. So the game should have concluded. \n\nResult [8] is a preview for Game 2, mentioning that Game 1 was a 6-2 loss for the Senators. It also notes that Game 2 is crucial. However, the user's query is about the April 22 game, which is Game 2. The search results might be conflicting because some sources refer to Game 1 (April 20) and others to Game 2 (April 22). \n\nWait, the user's query's ancillary data refers to the April 22 game. The search results include [1], which is the ESPN live score for April 22, showing the final score as 2-2 with OT. But that's impossible in playoffs. Maybe the data is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the game went into multiple overtimes and the final result wasn't captured in the search results. \n\nLooking at result [3], the Fox Sports page shows the final score as Senators 2, Maple Leafs 2, but that's during the 3rd period. The timestamp on the result is April 22, but the current time is past that. So perhaps the game went into overtime and the final result isn't reflected here. Alternatively, maybe the game was postponed or canceled. \n\nWait, the user's query says the game was scheduled for April 22 at 7:30 PM ET. The current timestamp is April 23, 2:42 AM UTC, which is April 22, 10:42 PM ET. So the game should have ended by now. If the game went into multiple overtimes, it might still be ongoing, but given the current time, it's unlikely. \n\nLooking at result [1], the ESPN live score shows the game ended in a 2-2 tie after OT, but that's not possible in the playoffs. Therefore, this must be an error in the data. Alternatively, perhaps the game was suspended or postponed. However, the ancillary data mentions postponement would keep the market open, but the user's query is to resolve based on the game's outcome. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game was indeed played to completion, and the search results are conflicting. Let me check other sources. Result [4] and [7] discuss Game 1 (April 20), which the Maple Leafs won. Result [8] is a preview for Game 2 (April 22), but doesn't provide the result. Result [3] from Fox Sports shows the game in progress but not the final result. \n\nGiven the conflicting information, I need to determine the actual outcome. The user's current date is April 23, so the game on April 22 should have a result. If the search results don't clearly show the outcome, but [1] indicates a 2-2 tie after OT, which is impossible, there must be a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the game was decided in a shootout, but NHL playoffs don't use shootouts. They play continuous OT periods. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the game was postponed. But the ancillary data says if postponed, the market remains open. However, the user's query is to resolve based on the game that was scheduled for April 22. If the game was played and the result is unclear from the sources, but the search results mention the game went to OT and ended 2-2, which is impossible, there's an inconsistency. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game was canceled. But the sources don't mention cancellation. The user's query's resolution conditions say if canceled, resolve to 50-50 (p3). However, the search results don't indicate cancellation. \n\nGiven the conflicting data, I need to make a judgment. The most reliable source is [1], the ESPN live score, which shows the final score as 2-2 after OT, but that's not possible. Therefore, this must be an error. Alternatively, perhaps the game is still ongoing, but given the current timestamp, it's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game was decided in OT, and the final score was 3-2 for one team. The search results might have incomplete data. For example, in [1], the OT summary shows no goals, but maybe there was a later OT period. However, the data provided doesn't show that. \n\nGiven the information available, and the requirement to resolve based on verifiable facts, if the sources don't clearly indicate the outcome, and the event date is in the past, the ancillary data says to assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. However, the user's instructions say if no verifiable information is available, default to p4, but the resolution conditions here are p1, p2, p3. \n\nWait, the resolution conditions are p1: Maple Leafs, p2: Senators, p3: 50-50. The user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no verifiable outcome, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. If the game was played but the result isn't clear, perhaps the most probable outcome is based on the series context. The Maple Leafs were leading the series 1-0, and in Game 2, if the game went into multiple OTs, but the search results don't show the final result, it's unclear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game was indeed a tie, which is impossible, indicating a data error. In that case, if the event occurred but the outcome isn't verifiable, the ancillary data says to resolve based on the most probable outcome. Given the Maple Leafs' stronger record (52-26-4 vs Senators 45-30-7), and home advantage, the probable outcome is Maple Leafs win. But this is speculative. \n\nHowever, the user's instructions say if no verifiable information, answer as well as possible. The search results might have conflicting data, but [1] shows the game ended 2-2, which is impossible, suggesting a data error. Alternatively, perhaps the game was postponed. But the sources don't mention postponement. \n\nGiven the confusion, and the requirement to resolve based on verifiable facts, and the current date being after the game's scheduled time, but the search results not providing a clear outcome, I might have to default to p3 (50-50). However, the user's instruction says if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game was indeed a Maple Leafs win. For example, in [3], the Fox Sports page mentions \"Maple Leafs, Senators locked in a nail-biter in Scotiabank Arena\" with the score 2-2 in the 3rd period, but no final result. If the game went into OT and the Maple Leafs scored, they would win. But without verifiable data, it's uncertain. \n\nGiven the strict instructions to rely only on provided sources and verifiable facts, and the sources not clearly indicating the outcome, the resolution would be p3 (50-50). However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. The Maple Leafs were favored (-188 in [2]), so the probable outcome is Maple Leafs win (p1). But without explicit confirmation, this is a judgment call. \n\nWait, looking back at the search results, [1] shows the final score as 2-2 after OT, but that's not possible. This must be an error. Alternatively, maybe the game was suspended. However, without explicit sources stating that, it's hard to confirm. \n\nGiven the conflict in the data and the requirement to resolve based on verifiable facts, and the sources not providing a clear outcome, the recommendation would be p3. However, the user's instruction says if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome, assume the most probable outcome. The Maple Leafs were leading the series and had a better record, so p1. But this is a tough call. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game was indeed a Maple Leafs win. For example, in [8], the preview for Game 2 mentions the Senators needing to bounce back after Game 1 loss. But that's about Game 1. The user's query is about Game 2. \n\nGiven the confusion in the sources and lack of clear final result, the safest recommendation is p3 (50-50) due to insufficient verifiable information. However, the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome if the event date is past. Given the Maple Leafs' strength, perhaps p1. But without explicit confirmation, this is risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game was postponed. But the sources don't mention that. The ancillary data says if postponed, the market remains open (p4), but the user's resolution conditions don't include p4. Wait, the resolution conditions are p1, p2, p3. The user's personalization says if the event is in the future, return p4. Since the event date is in the past, and no verifiable outcome, assume most probable. \n\nGiven the conflicting data, but the Maple Leafs being the stronger team and home advantage, the recommendation is p1. However, this is speculative. Alternatively, if the game ended in a tie, which is impossible, it's a data error, and the market should resolve to p3. \n\nThis is a difficult situation with conflicting data. The correct approach is to state that the outcome cannot be verified from the provided sources, hence p3. But the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome. Given the ambiguity, I'll recommend p1 based on the probable outcome, but with low confidence. Alternatively, if the sources don't confirm, p3 is safer. \n\nWait, looking again at [1], the ESPN live score for April 22 game shows the final score as Senators 2, Maple Leafs 2, but in NHL playoffs, that's impossible. Therefore, this must be an error, and the game likely continued until a goal was scored. However, the provided data doesn't show the final result. Without verifiable information, per the user's instructions, assume the most probable outcome. The Maple Leafs were favored, so p1. \n\nBut without explicit confirmation, this is a guess. The user's instructions require strict adherence to verifiable facts. Since the sources don't provide a clear result, the recommendation is p3.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745376142 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-23 02:42:22 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please clarify the use of ancillary data in determining the most probable outcome when explicit results are not available. Also, ensure that the search results are accurately interpreted and that any confusion in the data is addressed more decisively.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Senators vs. Maple Leafs game on April 22, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Maple Leafs win, it's p1; Senators win, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and time. The query says April 22 at 7:30 PM ET. The current timestamp given is April 23, 2025, 2:42 AM UTC, which is the same as April 22, 10:42 PM ET. So the game has already occurred.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are multiple sources. Result [1] is the ESPN live score for the game on April 22, showing the final score as Senators 2, Maple Leafs 2 in overtime. Wait, but the table shows the final score as 2-2 with no goals in OT. However, the period summary mentions OT but no goals. But NHL playoff games can't end in a tie; they go into multiple overtimes until someone scores. This seems conflicting. Maybe the live score wasn't updated? Let me check other sources.\n\nResult [3] from Fox Sports mentions the game on April 22, 2025, and in the play-by-play, it shows the Senators scoring in the 3rd period to tie it 2-2. The OT summary in [1] says no goals, but that's only the first OT. Wait, NHL playoffs have continuous overtime periods until a goal is scored. So if the game ended 2-2, that's not possible. There must be a mistake here. Let me check other sources.\n\nResult [4] and [7] discuss Game 1 on April 20, where the Maple Leafs won 6-2. The user's query is about the game on April 22, which is Game 2. The search results include [1], [2], [3], [8] about the April 22 game. \n\nLooking at [1], the ESPN live score for April 22 game shows the final score as Senators 2, Maple Leafs 2, but that's after OT. However, NHL playoff games don't end in a tie. This must be an error in the data. Alternatively, maybe the game went into multiple overtimes and the data is incomplete. Let me check result [3] from Fox Sports. The live score there shows the game as Senators 2, Maple Leafs 2 with 5:13 left in the 3rd period, but that's during the game, not the final. Wait, the timestamp on [3] is April 22, 2025, but the current date is April 23. So the game should have concluded. \n\nResult [8] is a preview for Game 2, mentioning that Game 1 was a 6-2 loss for the Senators. It also notes that Game 2 is crucial. However, the user's query is about the April 22 game, which is Game 2. The search results might be conflicting because some sources refer to Game 1 (April 20) and others to Game 2 (April 22). \n\nWait, the user's query's ancillary data refers to the April 22 game. The search results include [1], which is the ESPN live score for April 22, showing the final score as 2-2 with OT. But that's impossible in playoffs. Maybe the data is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the game went into multiple overtimes and the final result wasn't captured in the search results. \n\nLooking at result [3], the Fox Sports page shows the final score as Senators 2, Maple Leafs 2, but that's during the 3rd period. The timestamp on the result is April 22, but the current time is past that. So perhaps the game went into overtime and the final result isn't reflected here. Alternatively, maybe the game was postponed or canceled. \n\nWait, the user's query says the game was scheduled for April 22 at 7:30 PM ET. The current timestamp is April 23, 2:42 AM UTC, which is April 22, 10:42 PM ET. So the game should have ended by now. If the game went into multiple overtimes, it might still be ongoing, but given the current time, it's unlikely. \n\nLooking at result [1], the ESPN live score shows the game ended in a 2-2 tie after OT, but that's not possible in the playoffs. Therefore, this must be an error in the data. Alternatively, perhaps the game was suspended or postponed. However, the ancillary data mentions postponement would keep the market open, but the user's query is to resolve based on the game's outcome. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game was indeed played to completion, and the search results are conflicting. Let me check other sources. Result [4] and [7] discuss Game 1 (April 20), which the Maple Leafs won. Result [8] is a preview for Game 2 (April 22), but doesn't provide the result. Result [3] from Fox Sports shows the game in progress but not the final result. \n\nGiven the conflicting information, I need to determine the actual outcome. The user's current date is April 23, so the game on April 22 should have a result. If the search results don't clearly show the outcome, but [1] indicates a 2-2 tie after OT, which is impossible, there must be a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the game was decided in a shootout, but NHL playoffs don't use shootouts. They play continuous OT periods. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the game was postponed.

However, the user's instructions say if no verifiable information is available, default to p4, but the resolution conditions here are p1, p2, p3. \n\nWait, the resolution conditions are p1: Maple Leafs, p2: Senators, p3: 50-50. The user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no verifiable outcome, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. If the game was played but the result isn't clear, perhaps the most probable outcome is based on the series context. The Maple Leafs were leading the series 1-0, and in Game 2, if the game went into multiple OTs, but the search results don't show the final result, it's unclear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game was indeed a tie, which is impossible, indicating a data error.

Your task is to analyze the provided query and decide which AI solver is best suited to handle it.\n\nAvailable solvers: perplexity\n\nSolver descriptions:\n- perplexity: Uses the Perplexity AI search engine to find information online to answer general questions. Best for:\n  * Historical data and events\n  * General knowledge questions requiring context\n  * Questions needing interpretation of complex information\n  * Has knowledge cutoff and may not have very recent information\n\n- code_runner: Executes code to fetch real-time data from specific APIs. Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Available Crypto Data Sources:\n    - Binance: Provides cryptocurrency price data for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies\n  * Available Sports Data Sources:\n    - Sports Data IO - MLB (baseball): MLB baseball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NBA (basketball): NBA basketball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NFL (football): NFL football scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NHL (hockey): NHL hockey scores, statistics, and game data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Senators vs. Maple Leafs, description: In the upcoming NHL game, scheduled for April 22 at 7:30PM ET:\nIf the Ottawa Senators win, the market will resolve to \"Senators\".\nIf the Toronto Maple Leafs win, the market will resolve to \"Maple Leafs\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Maple Leafs, p2 to Senators, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nRoute the query to the perplexity solver for processing.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date.
