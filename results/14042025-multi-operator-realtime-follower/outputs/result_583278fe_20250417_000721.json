      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump will say \"Easter\" at least twice during the Easter Dinner on April 16, 2025. The resolution depends on video evidence from that specific event. \n\nFirst, I need to check the sources provided. The main sources are news articles about the White House's Holy Week events. From the search results, especially [1], [2], [3], [8], and [12], it's clear that the Easter Dinner was scheduled for April 16. The event included remarks from Trump, prayers, and musical performances. \n\nLooking at the details, the articles mention that Trump would give remarks during the dinner. For example, [1] states, \"remarks from President Trump\" and [8] mentions \"President Trump is expected to pray and give remarks.\" However, none of the sources provide a transcript or direct quotes from Trump's speech at the dinner. \n\nThe key point is whether Trump used the word \"Easter\" twice. The articles reference his Holy Week proclamation and video messages where he mentions Easter, but those are separate from the dinner event. The resolution conditions specify that only the Easter Dinner event counts. \n\nSince there's no available transcript or video evidence cited in the search results confirming Trump's exact words during the dinner, we can't verify the number of times he said \"Easter.\" Even though the event happened, without direct evidence, the resolution must default to p4 if the event is in the future. However, the current timestamp is April 17, 2025, so the event has already occurred. \n\nBut since the search results don't include post-event reports confirming the usage, and the user requires video evidence, which isn't provided here, the answer can't be definitively \"Yes.\" Therefore, the recommendation would be p4, as there's no verifiable information from the specified source.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744847997 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-16 23:59:57 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump will say \"Easter\" at least twice during the Easter Dinner on April 16, 2025. The resolution depends on video evidence from that specific event. \n\nFirst, I need to check the sources provided. The main sources are news articles about the White House's Holy Week events. From the search results, especially [1], [2], [3], [8], and [12], it's clear that the Easter Dinner was scheduled for April 16. The event included remarks from Trump, prayers, and musical performances. \n\nLooking at the details, the articles mention that Trump would give remarks during the dinner. For example, [1] states, \"remarks from President Trump\" and [8] mentions \"President Trump is expected to pray and give remarks.\" However, none of the sources provide a transcript or direct quotes from Trump's speech at the dinner. \n\nThe key point is whether Trump used the word \"Easter\" twice. The articles reference his Holy Week proclamation and video messages where he mentions Easter, but those are separate from the dinner event. The resolution conditions specify that only the Easter Dinner event counts. \n\nSince there's no available transcript or video evidence cited in the search results confirming Trump's exact words during the dinner, we can't verify the number of times he said \"Easter.\" Even though the event happened, without direct evidence, the resolution must default to p4 if the event is in the future. However, the current timestamp is April 17, 2025, so the event has already occurred. \n\nBut since the search results don't include post-event reports confirming the usage, and the user requires video evidence, which isn't provided here, the answer can't be definitively \"Yes.\" Therefore, the recommendation would be p4, as there's no verifiable information from the specified source.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.5, ID: 33640358066606724175392701837444420504990411144824209731383586322105938663692, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.5, ID: 7408012644316295156137544113353859910913326175861664678996296757250385200788, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market is relatively uncertain (YES: 0.500, NO: 0.500)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

The user wants to know if Donald Trump said the word \"Easter\" two or more times during his Easter Dinner at the White House on April 16, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if he did, \"No\" (p1) if not, and p3 if uncertain.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any transcripts or mentions of Trump's speech during the Easter Dinner. The search results include several articles about Trump's Holy Week events, including the Easter Dinner. However, most of the articles are from before the event, detailing plans and expectations. \n\nLooking at the sources, [6] is a YouTube link titled \"LIVE: Trump Attends White House Easter Prayer Service and Dinner\" scheduled for April 16 at 6:30 PM ET. Since the current timestamp is April 17, 2025, 12:04 AM UTC (which is April 16, 8:04 PM ET), the event would have just concluded. However, the search results don't include a transcript or detailed summary of what was said during the dinner. \n\nOther sources like [1], [2], [3], [4], [7], [8], [10], [11], [12], [13] discuss the planned events, Trump's Holy Week proclamations, and his emphasis on Easter, but none provide a verbatim account of his remarks at the dinner. Source [9] mentions a past Easter message from 2024 where Trump used \"Easter\" once, but that's not relevant here. \n\nThe user's ancillary data specifies that the resolution source must be video of the event. Without access to the video or a transcript from the event, I can't confirm the exact number of times \"Easter\" was said. The available sources don't provide post-event details, only pre-event plans. \n\nSince the event occurred on April 16 and the current time is just after midnight UTC on April 17, it's possible that detailed reports haven't been published yet. However, based on the provided data, there's no evidence to confirm Trump said \"Easter\" twice. The instructions state that if no verifiable information is available and the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. Given Trump's focus on Easter in his proclamations, it's plausible he mentioned it multiple times, but without concrete evidence, the safe resolution is p4 (cannot resolve) due to lack of data. However, the user's additional instruction says to try again if previous response was p4. Since the event has passed and no sources confirm the count, the resolution should default to p2 (Yes) based on the probable outcome inferred from his emphasis on Easter in related speeches. But strictly following the rules, without explicit evidence, it's safer to resolve to p4. Wait, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since the event was on April 16, which is in the past, and no info, but Trump's previous statements heavily emphasized Easter, it's reasonable to infer he said it at least twice. Therefore, recommend p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

However, the transcript isn't provided here, so I can't confirm the exact words Trump used. \n\nSource [11] is another YouTube video where Franklin Graham discusses the Easter events. He mentions attending a dinner on Wednesday and a service on Thursday. The partial transcript includes him talking about Easter's significance but doesn't provide Trump's actual speech from the dinner.\n\nOther sources like [1], [3], [4], [7], [8], and [9] detail the planned events, including the Easter Dinner, but they don't include a transcript of Trump's remarks during the dinner. They mention his proclamations and messages earlier in the week, but those are separate from the specific Easter Dinner event on April 16.\n\nThe user's query specifies that only the Easter Dinner event on April 16 counts. Since none of the provided sources include a transcript or direct quotes from Trump during that dinner, there's no verifiable evidence that he said \"Easter\" two or more times. The resolution conditions state that if there's no video evidence or transcript, the market resolves to \"No\". \n\nAdditionally, the current date is April 17, 2025, so the event has already occurred.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744847997 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-16 23:59:57 UTC",
