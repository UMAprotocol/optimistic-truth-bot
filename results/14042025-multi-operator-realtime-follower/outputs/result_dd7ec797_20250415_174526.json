      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"Fentanyl\" during her next White House press briefing. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if she does, \"No\" otherwise. The current date is April 15, 2025, and the next briefing is scheduled for today at 12:50 PM EDT. \n\nFirst, I need to check if there's any information about today's briefing. The search results include a transcript from April 11, 2025, where Leavitt discussed tariffs and other issues but didn't mention fentanyl. However, the briefing scheduled for April 15 is listed in the search results [12], but the transcript isn't provided yet. \n\nLooking at past briefings, Leavitt frequently mentioned fentanyl when discussing tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China. For example, on January 31 [1][15], March 5 [3][4], and April 11 [13], she tied tariffs to fentanyl concerns. However, in the April 11 briefing, she didn't mention fentanyl, focusing instead on other topics like the president's health and foreign policy.\n\nThe user's query specifies that the term \"Fentanyl\" in any form (plural, possessive) counts, but not other forms. The market resolves based on the next briefing she participates in. Since the April 15 briefing is today, and given her pattern, there's a possibility she might mention it again, especially if tariffs or border issues are discussed. However, without the actual transcript, it's uncertain. \n\nBut according to the rules, if the event date is in the past (April 15 is today, and the briefing time was 12:50 PM EDT, which is before the current UTC time of 5:38 PM), we need to check if it happened. The search result [12] shows the briefing was scheduled, but there's no transcript yet. If no transcript is available and no sources confirm she said \"Fentanyl,\" the resolution should default to the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nGiven her history, there's a high chance she mentioned fentanyl, but without explicit evidence, the safe answer is \"No\" (p1). However, the user's instruction says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. Since she often mentions fentanyl in tariff discussions, and the April 15 briefing might have covered tariffs, it's likely she did say it. But without confirmation, the cautious approach is p4 (cannot resolve). Wait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since the event occurred today, and no sources confirm, but her pattern suggests she might have, but we can't verify. Therefore, the recommendation is p4. Wait, no\u2014the user's instruction says if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. So if the briefing happened and no sources contradict, assume she did. But since the briefing just happened and there's no transcript, maybe the answer is p2. But the system might not have access to the latest data. Since the current timestamp is after the briefing, but no sources are provided confirming she said it, the resolution should be p4. Wait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable based on her history is that she did mention it, so p2. But without evidence, the correct answer is p4. Hmm, conflicting rules. The key is that the event date is in the past (April 15), but the current time is after the briefing. If no sources are provided in the search results that mention the April 15 briefing's content regarding fentanyl, then we can't confirm. Therefore, the resolution should be p4. But the user's instruction says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since she often mentions fentanyl in briefings, especially related to tariffs, and the April 15 briefing was about press matters, but without explicit evidence, the answer is p2. Wait, but the user's personalization says if no verifiable information, default to p4. So the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"Fentanyl\" during her next White House press briefing. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if she does, \"No\" otherwise. The current date is April 15, 2025, and the next briefing is scheduled for today at 12:50 PM EDT. \n\nFirst, I need to check if there's any information about today's briefing. The search results include a transcript from April 11, 2025, where Leavitt discussed tariffs and other issues but didn't mention fentanyl. However, the briefing scheduled for April 15 is listed in the search results [12], but the transcript isn't provided yet. \n\nLooking at past briefings, Leavitt frequently mentioned fentanyl when discussing tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China. For example, on January 31 [1][15], March 5 [3][4], and April 11 [13], she tied tariffs to fentanyl concerns. However, in the April 11 briefing, she didn't mention fentanyl, focusing instead on other topics like the president's health and foreign policy.\n\nThe user's query specifies that the term \"Fentanyl\" in any form (plural, possessive) counts, but not other forms. The market resolves based on the next briefing she participates in. Since the April 15 briefing is today, and given her pattern, there's a possibility she might mention it again, especially if tariffs or border issues are discussed. However, without the actual transcript, it's uncertain. \n\nBut according to the rules, if the event date is in the past (April 15 is today, and the briefing time was 12:50 PM EDT, which is before the current UTC time of 5:38 PM), we need to check if it happened. The search result [12] shows the briefing was scheduled, but there's no transcript yet. If no transcript is available and no sources confirm she said \"Fentanyl,\" the resolution should default to the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nGiven her history, there's a high chance she mentioned fentanyl, but without explicit evidence, the safe answer is \"No\" (p1). However, the user's instruction says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. Since she often mentions fentanyl in tariff discussions, and the April 15 briefing might have covered tariffs, it's likely she did say it. But without confirmation, the cautious approach is p4 (cannot resolve). Wait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since the event occurred today, and no sources confirm, but her pattern suggests she might have, but we can't verify. Therefore, the recommendation is p4. Wait, no\u2014the user's instruction says if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. So if the briefing happened and no sources contradict, assume she did. But since the briefing just happened and there's no transcript, maybe the answer is p2. But the system might not have access to the latest data. Since the current timestamp is after the briefing, but no sources are provided confirming she said it, the resolution should be p4. Wait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable based on her history is that she did mention it, so p2. But without evidence, the correct answer is p4. Hmm, conflicting rules. The key is that the event date is in the past (April 15), but the current time is after the briefing. If no sources are provided in the search results that mention the April 15 briefing's content regarding fentanyl, then we can't confirm. Therefore, the resolution should be p4. But the user's instruction says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since she often mentions fentanyl in briefings, especially related to tariffs, and the April 15 briefing was about press matters, but without explicit evidence, the answer is p2. Wait, but the user's personalization says if no verifiable information, default to p4. So the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.485, ID: 93178023182441177448296368144493873859872400392155282458105980465406899302479, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.515, ID: 25715461830361504776455442250334088944131371699086399665709259654903777356427, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market is relatively uncertain (YES: 0.485, NO: 0.515)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

The market resolves to \"Yes\" if she does, \"No\" otherwise. The current date is April 15, 2025, and the briefing is scheduled for today.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a press briefing today. The search results [7], [9], [10], [11], [12], [15] all indicate that a briefing is happening on April 15, 2025. So the event is occurring as per the schedule.\n\nNext, I need to verify if Karoline Leavitt is still the White House Press Secretary. The sources mention her holding the briefing today, so she hasn't ceased her role. That means the market won't resolve to \"No\" based on her position.\n\nNow, the critical part: whether she says \"Fentanyl\" during the briefing. The user provided search results include transcripts from previous briefings where she frequently discussed fentanyl in the context of tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China. For example, in the March 5 briefing [8], she mentioned fentanyl multiple times, linking it to the tariffs. Similarly, the January 31 briefing [6] and others [4], [5] show that fentanyl is a recurring topic in her statements.\n\nGiven the recent context, the tariffs and border security are likely topics in today's briefing. The search result [7] mentions the trade war with China over fentanyl, and [15] notes the ongoing discussion about tariffs. Since Leavitt has consistently tied tariffs to fentanyl in past briefings, it's probable she'll mention it again today.\n\nHowever, the actual content of today's briefing isn't available in the provided search results. The transcripts and videos from April 15 are referenced but not detailed. Without direct evidence from today's briefing, I can't be certain. But based on her pattern and the current news focus on tariffs and fentanyl, it's highly likely she'll use the term.\n\nThe resolution conditions state that if the term is used in any context, including plural or possessive forms, it counts. Given her history, even a single mention would suffice. Since the event is happening today and she's actively discussing related topics, the recommendation would lean towards \"Yes\" unless proven otherwise. However, without the actual transcript, there's a slight uncertainty. But the preponderance of evidence suggests she will mention \"Fentanyl.\"\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say the word \"Fentanyl\" during her next White House press briefing. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if she does, \"No\" otherwise. The current date is April 15, 2025, and the briefing is scheduled for today.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a press briefing today. The search results [7], [9], [10], [11], [12], [15] all indicate that a briefing is happening on April 15, 2025. So the event is occurring as per the schedule.\n\nNext, I need to verify if Karoline Leavitt is still the White House Press Secretary. The sources mention her holding the briefing today, so she hasn't ceased her role. That means the market won't resolve to \"No\" based on her position.\n\nNow, the critical part: whether she says \"Fentanyl\" during the briefing. The user provided search results include transcripts from previous briefings where she frequently discussed fentanyl in the context of tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China. For example, in the March 5 briefing [8], she mentioned fentanyl multiple times, linking it to the tariffs. Similarly, the January 31 briefing [6] and others [4], [5] show that fentanyl is a recurring topic in her statements.\n\nGiven the recent context, the tariffs and border security are likely topics in today's briefing. The search result [7] mentions the trade war with China over fentanyl, and [15] notes the ongoing discussion about tariffs. Since Leavitt has consistently tied tariffs to fentanyl in past briefings, it's probable she'll mention it again today.\n\nHowever, the actual content of today's briefing isn't available in the provided search results. The transcripts and videos from April 15 are referenced but not detailed. Without direct evidence from today's briefing, I can't be certain. But based on her pattern and the current news focus on tariffs and fentanyl, it's highly likely she'll use the term.\n\nThe resolution conditions state that if the term is used in any context, including plural or possessive forms, it counts. Given her history, even a single mention would suffice. Since the event is happening today and she's actively discussing related topics, the recommendation would lean towards \"Yes\" unless proven otherwise. However, without the actual transcript, there's a slight uncertainty. But the preponderance of evidence suggests she will mention \"Fentanyl.\"\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.485, ID: 93178023182441177448296368144493873859872400392155282458105980465406899302479, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.515, ID: 25715461830361504776455442250334088944131371699086399665709259654903777356427, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market is relatively uncertain (YES: 0.485, NO: 0.515)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nIf the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3.

Since the current time is April 15, 5:36 PM UTC, the next briefing would be the one on April 15, which is already past the typical briefing time (usually between 12 PM and 3 PM ET, which is 16:00 to 19:00 UTC). The live briefing in [9] and [11] is from April 15, so that's the relevant one. However, the search results don't include the transcript for April 15.

The April 15 briefing is mentioned in [9] and [11], but without the transcript, I can't confirm if \"Fentanyl\" was mentioned.\n\nHowever, looking at the pattern in previous briefings, Leavitt frequently discusses Fentanyl, especially in the context of tariffs and border security.

Since the event (April 15 briefing) has occurred, but there's no transcript, we have to infer. Given her history, it's likely she mentioned Fentanyl. However, the strict resolution conditions require concrete evidence. Since the search results don't include the April 15 transcript, we can't confirm.

The resolution conditions are based on whether she uses the exact term, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if she does, \"No\" (p1) if she doesn't, and p3 if it's uncertain.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp is April 15, 2025, 17:36:00 UTC. The user is asking about the next press briefing. Looking at the search results, there's a press briefing scheduled for April 15, 2025, at 1 p.m. Eastern Time, which is 17:00 UTC. Since the current time is 17:36 UTC, the briefing has already occurred. \n\nNow, I need to verify if Karoline Leavitt participated in this briefing. Search result [11] is a YouTube video titled \"WATCH LIVE: Karoline Leavitt Holds White House Press ... - YouTube\" dated April 15, 2025. The description confirms she held the briefing. Additionally, result [9] from the White House website lists the April 15 briefing as live, and result [6] mentions the briefing happening at 1 p.m., which aligns with the timestamp.\n\nNext, I need to check the transcript or content of the April 15 briefing to see if \"Fentanyl\" was mentioned. The search results don't include the full transcript of the April 15 briefing, but result [6] mentions that Leavitt would likely be pressed on the trade dispute with China, including fentanyl issues. However, without the exact transcript, I have to rely on available data.\n\nLooking at previous briefings, Leavitt frequently discussed fentanyl in the context of tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China. For example, in the January 31 briefing (result [7]), she explicitly mentioned fentanyl as the reason for tariffs. Similarly, in the March 5 briefing (result [14], [16], [17]), she had heated exchanges about fentanyl seizures and tariffs. Her pattern shows she consistently brings up fentanyl when discussing border security and trade policies.\n\nGiven the April 15 briefing's context\u2014escalated trade tensions with China and recent fentanyl-related tariff discussions\u2014it's highly probable that \"Fentanyl\" was mentioned. The user's ancillary data states that any usage of the term counts, regardless of context. Since the briefing has already occurred and the topic is central to current events, the likelihood is high. However, without the exact transcript, there's a slight uncertainty. But considering the established pattern and the briefing's context, the most probable outcome is that she did say \"Fentanyl.\"\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt mentioned \"Fentanyl\" during the April 15, 2025 White House press briefing. The resolution depends on whether she used the exact term, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if she did, \"No\" (p1) if not, and p3 if uncertain.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The current date is April 15, 2025, and the briefing in question is today. Looking at the search results, [3] and [8] mention a briefing on April 15. [3] is a live briefing link, but the transcript isn't fully provided. However, [8] links to the White House live page, which lists the April 15 briefing as \"Live Now\" but doesn't provide the transcript. \n\nOther relevant sources: [10], [11], [12], [13], and [14] discuss previous briefings where Leavitt mentioned fentanyl in the context of tariffs and seizures. For example, in [10] on January 31, she discussed tariffs due to fentanyl. [11] on March 5 has a detailed exchange about fentanyl from Canada. [13] and [14] critique her use of fentanyl statistics to justify tariffs. \n\nHowever, the key is the April 15 briefing. The user provided a search result [3] from the Economic Times, which mentions the briefing but doesn't include the transcript. The YouTube link [7] is from March 9, where she discussed fentanyl, but that's not the April 15 briefing. The Rev.com transcripts [10], [11], [12] are from earlier dates. \n\nThe critical point is whether in the April 15 briefing, she said \"Fentanyl.\" Since the search results don't include the transcript for April 15, but [8] confirms the briefing happened, I need to check if any of the provided sources mention it. The user also provided a transcript from [3], but it's a live update without specific content. \n\nWait, looking at [3], the live briefing's description says Leavitt is expected to address economic agenda and tariff tensions. Given that previous briefings linked tariffs to fentanyl, it's possible she mentioned it again. However, without the actual transcript, I can't confirm. The user's additional instruction says to check if the term was mentioned in the April 15 briefing. Since the provided search results don't include the transcript for that specific date, and the only mention is in the context of previous briefings, there's no direct evidence she said \"Fentanyl\" on April 15. \n\nBut wait, the user's personalization says to check the provided sources. Since the April 15 briefing isn't detailed in the search results, and the query's resolution depends on that specific event, the absence of evidence in the provided sources might mean the answer is \"No.\" However, considering her history of discussing fentanyl in nearly every briefing related to tariffs, it's plausible she mentioned it. But without explicit evidence, per the rules, if there's no verifiable info, and the event date is in the past (April 15 is today, but the current timestamp is 5:44 PM UTC, so after the briefing), but the sources don't confirm it, the resolution should be based on available data. \n\nSince the user provided a transcript from [3] which is a live briefing link but no content, and other sources don't mention April 15, I have to assume that without explicit mention in the provided sources, the answer is \"No.\" However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. Given her pattern, she might have mentioned it, but the rules state to rely only on provided sources. Since none of the provided sources confirm she said \"Fentanyl\" on April 15, the resolution should be \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Best for:\n  * Historical data and events\n  * General knowledge questions requiring context\n  * Questions needing interpretation of complex information\n  * Has knowledge cutoff and may not have very recent information\n\n- code_runner: Executes code to fetch real-time data from specific APIs. Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Currently available data sources based on API keys:\n    - MLB (Major League Baseball) data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Will Karoline Leavitt say \"Fentanyl\" during next White House press briefing?, description: This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Karoline Leavitt says the listed term during the next White House press briefing she participates in. Otherwise, the market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nAny usage of the term regardless of context will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nPluralization/possessive of the term will count toward the resolution of this market, however other forms will NOT count.\n\nInstances where the term is used in a compound word will count regardless of context (e.g. joyful is not a compound word for \"joy,\" however \"killjoy\" is a compounding of the words \"kill\" and \"joy\").\n\nIf no such press briefing happens by December 31, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"No\". If Leavitt ceases to be White House press secretary for any length of time by December 31, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThis market refers to the regular White House press briefings, which are typically scheduled on weekdays between 12 PM ET and 3 PM ET as per the official schedule.\n\nThe resolution source will be video and transcripts of the press briefing.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe perplexity solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: perplexity\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",
