      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the EU will impose any new or increased tariffs on the U.S. between February 1 and April 30, 2025. The resolution depends on whether such tariffs were officially enacted by the EU within that timeframe.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. Let's go through them one by one. \n\nSearch result [1] mentions that on April 2, 2025, Trump imposed 20% tariffs on all goods from the EU. In response, the EU approved the first set of 25% retaliatory tariffs on April 9, which were set to start on April 15. However, on April 10, the EU suspended these countermeasures for 90 days following Trump's postponement. So, the EU did enact tariffs on April 9, but then suspended them. The key question is whether the enactment before the suspension counts as \"imposing\" tariffs within the timeframe.\n\nSearch result [2] states that the EU approved \u20ac22 billion in retaliatory tariffs on April 9, with the first phase starting April 15. But again, this was suspended on April 10. \n\nSearch result [6] and [11] confirm that the EU paused the tariffs on April 10, but they were officially approved on April 9. The user's query specifies that any tariff officially enacted between February 1 and April 30 counts, regardless of when it goes into effect. Since the EU approved the tariffs on April 9, which is within the timeframe, even though they were later suspended, the enactment still occurred within the window. \n\nSearch result [8] and [9] mention that the EU's tariffs were delayed until July 14, but the official enactment was on April 9. The suspension doesn't negate the fact that the tariffs were imposed before the deadline. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that only tariffs imposed by the EU (not member states) count, and the sources confirm the EU as the imposing body. Therefore, despite the suspension, the EU did impose new tariffs within the specified period. \n\nThus, the answer should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.

The user wants to know if the EU will impose any new or increased tariffs on the U.S. between February 1 and April 30, 2025. The resolution depends on whether such tariffs were officially enacted by the EU within that timeframe.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. Let's go through them one by one. \n\nSearch result [1] mentions that on April 2, 2025, Trump imposed 20% tariffs on all goods from the EU. In response, the EU approved the first set of 25% retaliatory tariffs on April 9, which were set to start on April 15. However, on April 10, the EU suspended these countermeasures for 90 days following Trump's postponement. So, the EU did enact tariffs on April 9, but then suspended them. The key question is whether the enactment before the suspension counts as \"imposing\" tariffs within the timeframe.\n\nSearch result [2] states that the EU approved \u20ac22 billion in retaliatory tariffs on April 9, with the first phase starting April 15. But again, this was suspended on April 10. \n\nSearch result [6] and [11] confirm that the EU paused the tariffs on April 10, but they were officially approved on April 9. The user's query specifies that any tariff officially enacted between February 1 and April 30 counts, regardless of when it goes into effect. Since the EU approved the tariffs on April 9, which is within the timeframe, even though they were later suspended, the enactment still occurred within the window. \n\nSearch result [8] and [9] mention that the EU's tariffs were delayed until July 14, but the official enactment was on April 9. The suspension doesn't negate the fact that the tariffs were imposed before the deadline. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that only tariffs imposed by the EU (not member states) count, and the sources confirm the EU as the imposing body. Therefore, despite the suspension, the EU did impose new tariffs within the specified period. \n\nThus, the answer should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.9535, ID: 26424706372316493587011752901276291637704683580325727106442941649186997962384, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.0465, ID: 14702623526643933240759910964892597260199081707117055983632097952480330575534, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.954 = 95.3% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nIf the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.
