      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the first U.S. \"Gold Card\" visa was officially issued by April 18, 2025, at 11:59 PM ET. The resolution depends on whether the Trump administration issued the Gold Card by that deadline.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The provided timestamp is April 19, 2025, which is after the deadline. So the event date (April 18) has already passed. Now, I need to look through the search results to see if there's any evidence that the Gold Card was issued by that date.\n\nLooking at the search results:\n\n- Result [1] from April 4 mentions Trump showing the Gold Card design and stating it would be available in \"less than two weeks.\" That would place the release around April 18. However, this article doesn't confirm actual issuance.\n  \n- Result [4] from April 11 quotes Commerce Secretary Lutnick saying the program would start within a week and a half. Adding 10 days to April 11 brings us to April 21, which is after the deadline. But this might be an approximate timeline.\n\n- Result [7] from April 4 (but with a GMT date of April 18) shows Trump revealing the card and saying it would be ready in less than two weeks. If \"less than two weeks\" from April 4 would be around April 18, but again, no confirmation of actual issuance.\n\n- Result [12] from April 4 mentions Trump stating the card would be available in \"less than two weeks probably,\" targeting around April 18. However, no explicit confirmation of issuance by the deadline.\n\n- Result [13] from March 24 claims 1,000 cards were sold in a day, but this seems to refer to sales, not official issuance. Also, the program's full launch might still be pending.\n\n- Result [14] from April 4 reports Trump unveiling the card and stating availability in less than two weeks, but no confirmation of actual issuance by April 18.\n\n- Result [15] from April 4 mentions a launch around April 17-18, but again, no explicit evidence that the first visa was issued by the deadline.\n\nNone of the search results explicitly confirm that the first Gold Card was officially issued by April 18. There are announcements and timelines suggesting it was close, but without concrete evidence of issuance by the deadline, the answer would default to \"No\" (p1). However, the user's personalization instructions say that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The conditions here are that the administration planned to release it by April 18, but without confirmation, the safe resolution is p4 (unknown). Wait, the resolution conditions here are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 0.5. But the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, the ancillary data says to use credible reporting. Since the sources mention the program was set to start around April 18 but don't confirm issuance, it's ambiguous. However, the user's instruction says if no verifiable info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. Given the administration's announcements targeting around April 18, it's probable they met the deadline. But without explicit confirmation, it's safer to resolve as p2 (Yes) if the sources indicate the program started as planned. Wait, result [4] says Lutnick on April 11 stated it would start in a week and a half, which would be around April 21-22, after the deadline. But result [1] and [7] from April 4 say \"less than two weeks,\" which would be around April 18. If the program was indeed launched by April 18, then p2 (Yes). However, without a source explicitly stating that the first card was issued by April 18, it's unclear. The user's instruction says to use a consensus of credible reporting. If multiple sources indicate the program was set to launch by April 18, but none confirm it actually happened, the resolution would be p4 (unknown). Wait, the resolution conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 0.5. But the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data says the primary source is official info, but credible reporting can be used. Since the administration announced it would be available by around April 18, and there's no report of delays, it's reasonable to assume it was issued on time. Therefore, resolve to p2 (Yes).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.

The user wants to know if the first U.S. \"Gold Card\" visa was officially issued by April 18, 2025, at 11:59 PM ET. The resolution depends on whether the Trump administration issued the Gold Card by that deadline.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The provided timestamp is April 19, 2025, which is after the deadline. So the event date (April 18) has already passed. Now, I need to look through the search results to see if there's any evidence that the Gold Card was issued by that date.\n\nLooking at the search results:\n\n- Result [1] from April 4 mentions Trump showing the Gold Card design and stating it would be available in \"less than two weeks.\" That would place the release around April 18. However, this article doesn't confirm actual issuance.\n  \n- Result [4] from April 11 quotes Commerce Secretary Lutnick saying the program would start within a week and a half. Adding 10 days to April 11 brings us to April 21, which is after the deadline. But this might be an approximate timeline.\n\n- Result [7] from April 4 (but with a GMT date of April 18) shows Trump revealing the card and saying it would be ready in less than two weeks. If \"less than two weeks\" from April 4 would be around April 18, but again, no confirmation of actual issuance.\n\n- Result [12] from April 4 mentions Trump stating the card would be available in \"less than two weeks probably,\" targeting around April 18. However, no explicit confirmation of issuance by the deadline.\n\n- Result [13] from March 24 claims 1,000 cards were sold in a day, but this seems to refer to sales, not official issuance. Also, the program's full launch might still be pending.\n\n- Result [14] from April 4 reports Trump unveiling the card and stating availability in less than two weeks, but no confirmation of actual issuance by April 18.\n\n- Result [15] from April 4 mentions a launch around April 17-18, but again, no explicit evidence that the first visa was issued by the deadline.\n\nNone of the search results explicitly confirm that the first Gold Card was officially issued by April 18. There are announcements and timelines suggesting it was close, but without concrete evidence of issuance by the deadline, the answer would default to \"No\" (p1). However, the user's personalization instructions say that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The conditions here are that the administration planned to release it by April 18, but without confirmation, the safe resolution is p4 (unknown). Wait, the resolution conditions here are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 0.5. But the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, the ancillary data says to use credible reporting. Since the sources mention the program was set to start around April 18 but don't confirm issuance, it's ambiguous. However, the user's instruction says if no verifiable info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. Given the administration's announcements targeting around April 18, it's probable they met the deadline. But without explicit confirmation, it's safer to resolve as p2 (Yes) if the sources indicate the program started as planned. Wait, result [4] says Lutnick on April 11 stated it would start in a week and a half, which would be around April 21-22, after the deadline. But result [1] and [7] from April 4 say \"less than two weeks,\" which would be around April 18. If the program was indeed launched by April 18, then p2 (Yes). However, without a source explicitly stating that the first card was issued by April 18, it's unclear. The user's instruction says to use a consensus of credible reporting. If multiple sources indicate the program was set to launch by April 18, but none confirm it actually happened, the resolution would be p4 (unknown). Wait, the resolution conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 0.5. But the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data says the primary source is official info, but credible reporting can be used. Since the administration announced it would be available by around April 18, and there's no report of delays, it's reasonable to assume it was issued on time. Therefore, resolve to p2 (Yes).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.0005, ID: 74758434735444951597162868768023164437304519141495420517481907142234296172241, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.9995, ID: 46419022378270196306485805687121547700529898134459462602790868483953163495257, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3.

The provided current date is April 19, 2025, which is after the deadline. So the event date has already passed. Now, I need to verify if the Gold Card was issued by April 18.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are several sources mentioning the Gold Card program. For example, source [7] from April 11 states that Commerce Secretary Lutnick announced the program would start within a week and a half. That would place the start date around April 21 or 22, which is after the deadline. However, source [10] mentions that on March 24, 2025, 1,000 cards were sold in a single day, which suggests that the program was already operational by then. But wait, March 24 is before April 18, so if cards were sold, does that mean they were issued? \n\nBut source [10] is from Business Today India, which might not be the most reliable. Let me cross-check. Source [11] from April 4 mentions Trump unveiling the card design and stating it would be available in less than two weeks, which would be around April 18. Source [14] from April 11 again mentions a start date within a week and a half, which would be after April 18. \n\nThere's a contradiction here. Some sources suggest the program started in March with sales, while others indicate a launch in mid-April. The official sources, like the Commerce Secretary's announcement on April 11, point to a start date after the deadline. However, the user's query requires the first issuance by April 18. \n\nThe ancillary data says that credible reporting can be used. If there's credible reporting that cards were issued before April 18, then the answer is Yes. Source [10] claims 1,000 cards sold on March 24, but it's unclear if those were officially issued or just applications. The term \"sold\" might refer to applications or commitments, not actual issuance. \n\nMoreover, source [11] mentions Trump showed the card design on April 4 and said it would be available in less than two weeks, which would be around April 18. If the program started on April 18, even if the first card was issued that day, it would meet the deadline. However, the exact issuance date isn't clear from the sources. \n\nGiven the conflicting information and the need to rely on credible reporting, the most recent official statement from the Commerce Secretary on April 11 ([7], [14]) states the program starts in a week and a half, which would be after April 18. Therefore, it's likely that the program hadn't officially issued any cards by the deadline. \n\nHowever, the user's previous response was p2 (Yes), and they want a different approach. Maybe I missed something. Let me check again. Source [10] says 1,000 cards sold on March 24, but this is from a Business Today India article. If this is accurate, then cards were issued before April 18. But is this a credible source? The ancillary data allows consensus of credible reporting. If multiple sources confirm issuance before April 18, then Yes. However, other sources like [7], [11], [14] suggest the program started in mid-April. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and the need to follow the ancillary data's resolution conditions, if there's no official confirmation but some reports of issuance, it's safer to go with p2 (Yes) if there's credible evidence. However, the official start date according to the Commerce Secretary was after the deadline. Therefore, the correct resolution should be p1 (No). But the user's previous answer was p2, so maybe they want to consider the March 24 sales as issuance. \n\nWait, the query says \"officially issued\". If the cards were sold but not officially issued, that might not count. The program's official launch according to the administration was after April 18. Therefore, the answer should be p1 (No). But the user wants a different approach. Maybe the initial answer was p2 based on the March sales, but upon re-evaluation, considering the official start date, it's p1. \n\nI need to reconcile this. The key is whether any Gold Card was officially issued by the deadline. The Commerce Secretary's statement on April 11 says the program starts in a week and a half, which is April 21-22. Therefore, no issuance before April 18. Hence, the answer should be p1 (No). But the user's previous response was p2, so maybe they considered the March sales as issuance. However, without official confirmation, it's risky. \n\nGiven the instructions to follow ancillary data and use credible reporting, and considering the official statements point to a post-April 18 start, the resolution should be p1 (No). But the user wants a different approach. Maybe the March 24 sales count as issuances. However, selling cards isn't the same as issuing visas.

Hence, p1 (No).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.0005, ID: 74758434735444951597162868768023164437304519141495420517481907142234296172241, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.9995, ID: 46419022378270196306485805687121547700529898134459462602790868483953163495257, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
