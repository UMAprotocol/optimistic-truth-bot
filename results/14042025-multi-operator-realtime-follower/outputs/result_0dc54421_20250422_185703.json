      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say the word \"Cabinet\" during her next White House press briefing. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if she does, \"No\" otherwise. The current date is April 22, 2025, and the next briefing is scheduled for today at 1 PM ET. \n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a press briefing today. The search results include a link to a live briefing on April 22, 2025, at 1 PM ET [15]. That's today, so the briefing is happening. Now, I need to determine if Leavitt will say \"Cabinet\" during this briefing.\n\nLooking at past briefings, Leavitt has frequently discussed Cabinet meetings. For example, in the February 25 briefing, she confirmed Elon Musk's attendance at the first Cabinet meeting [1][3]. On March 26, she mentioned the Cabinet meeting updates [4]. The February 26 briefing also involved discussions about the Cabinet meeting with Musk [9][12]. These instances show that Cabinet-related topics are common in her briefings.\n\nAdditionally, the user's ancillary data specifies that any form of the word \"Cabinet\" (including plural or possessive) counts. Given the recent focus on Cabinet activities, especially with Musk's involvement, it's likely that the term will come up. The live briefing today might include updates on recent Cabinet meetings or initiatives, which would require her to mention \"Cabinet.\"\n\nSince the briefing is today and the historical context shows frequent use of the term, the probability is high. Therefore, the resolution should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say the word \"Cabinet\" during her next White House press briefing. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if she does, \"No\" otherwise. The current date is April 22, 2025, and the next briefing is scheduled for today at 1 PM ET. \n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a press briefing today. The search results include a link to a live briefing on April 22, 2025, at 1 PM ET [15]. That's today, so the briefing is happening. Now, I need to determine if Leavitt will say \"Cabinet\" during this briefing.\n\nLooking at past briefings, Leavitt has frequently discussed Cabinet meetings. For example, in the February 25 briefing, she confirmed Elon Musk's attendance at the first Cabinet meeting [1][3]. On March 26, she mentioned the Cabinet meeting updates [4]. The February 26 briefing also involved discussions about the Cabinet meeting with Musk [9][12]. These instances show that Cabinet-related topics are common in her briefings.\n\nAdditionally, the user's ancillary data specifies that any form of the word \"Cabinet\" (including plural or possessive) counts. Given the recent focus on Cabinet activities, especially with Musk's involvement, it's likely that the term will come up. The live briefing today might include updates on recent Cabinet meetings or initiatives, which would require her to mention \"Cabinet.\"\n\nSince the briefing is today and the historical context shows frequent use of the term, the probability is high. Therefore, the resolution should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.005, ID: 96991195951155634488598131501619145059941654412002614603401600042294824458615, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.995, ID: 73383542491397471924913095200269031755457779973626311369900057508999560770669, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say the word \"Cabinet\" during her next White House press briefing. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if she does, \"No\" otherwise. The current date is April 22, 2025, and the briefing in question is scheduled for today at 1 PM ET. \n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a press briefing happening today. The search results mention a briefing scheduled for April 22, 2025, at 1 PM ET [9][10][15]. So the event is happening today, which is within the timeframe specified. Since the briefing is today, and the current time is 6:56 PM UTC (which is 2:56 PM ET), the briefing has already occurred. Therefore, the event date is in the past, and we need to verify if \"Cabinet\" was mentioned.\n\nNext, I need to look through the provided search results for any transcripts or mentions of today's briefing. The search results include a transcript from the April 1, 2025 briefing [11], but the latest one mentioned is April 22, 2025. However, the detailed transcripts for April 22 aren't fully provided here. But there are some clues.\n\nLooking at the April 22 briefing in search result [2], the transcript snippet shows Leavitt discussing trade deals and mentions the \"trade team\" but not \"Cabinet\". However, in the April 1 briefing [11], she mentions the \"trade and tariff team\" but again not \"Cabinet\". \n\nWait, in search result [5], from February 25, 2025, there's a transcript where she mentions the president's Cabinet meeting and Elon Musk attending. She uses the word \"Cabinet\" multiple times in that context. For example, she says, \"the president and his Cabinet are working as one unified team\" and \"the entire administration will be in attendance tomorrow just to talk about DOGE's efforts and how all of the Cabinet secretaries are identifying waste...\" [5]. However, this is from February, not the April 22 briefing.\n\nIn the April 18 MAGA Minute video [14], Leavitt mentions companies and events but not \"Cabinet\". The April 16 briefing with Patty Morin [13] doesn't mention \"Cabinet\" either. \n\nThe key here is that the user is asking about the NEXT briefing after the query date, which is April 22. Since the current timestamp is April 22, 6:56 PM UTC, and the briefing was at 1 PM ET (which is 5 PM UTC), the briefing has already happened. However, the provided search results don't include the full transcript of the April 22 briefing. The only mention is in [2], which is a partial transcript where she talks about trade deals but doesn't use \"Cabinet\". \n\nBut wait, in the April 22 briefing transcript snippet [2], she says, \"I spoke to our entire trade team this morning there is a lot of progress being made we now have 18 proposals on paper that have been brought to the trade team again these are proposals on paper that countries have proposed to the Trump administration and to our government uh you have Secretary Bessant Secretary Lutnik Ambassador Greer NEC Director Hasset and Peter Navaro the entire trade team meeting with 34 countries this week alone...\" Here, she lists officials but doesn't mention \"Cabinet\".\n\nHowever, in the February 25 briefing [5], when asked about the Cabinet meeting, she says, \"Elon Musk is going to attend the president's first Cabinet meeting tomorrow.\" She uses \"Cabinet\" explicitly. But that's a different briefing.\n\nGiven that the user's query is about the NEXT briefing (April 22), and the provided transcripts for that day don't include the word \"Cabinet\", but the market sentiment is leaning towards \"No\", I need to check if there's any mention in the available data. Since the search results don't show her using \"Cabinet\" in the April 22 briefing, and the ancillary data says any usage counts, including plural or possessive forms, but no other forms. \n\nHowever, in the absence of explicit evidence from the April 22 briefing transcript, and considering the market's strong inclination towards \"No\", it's likely that she didn't say \"Cabinet\" during that specific briefing. Therefore, the resolution should be \"No\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say the word \"Cabinet\" during her next White House press briefing. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if she does, \"No\" otherwise. The current date is April 22, 2025, and the briefing in question is scheduled for today at 1 PM ET. \n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a press briefing happening today. The search results mention a briefing scheduled for April 22, 2025, at 1 PM ET [9][10][15]. So the event is happening today, which is within the timeframe specified. Since the briefing is today, and the current time is 6:56 PM UTC (which is 2:56 PM ET), the briefing has already occurred. Therefore, the event date is in the past, and we need to verify if \"Cabinet\" was mentioned.\n\nNext, I need to look through the provided search results for any transcripts or mentions of today's briefing. The search results include a transcript from the April 1, 2025 briefing [11], but the latest one mentioned is April 22, 2025. However, the detailed transcripts for April 22 aren't fully provided here. But there are some clues.\n\nLooking at the April 22 briefing in search result [2], the transcript snippet shows Leavitt discussing trade deals and mentions the \"trade team\" but not \"Cabinet\". However, in the April 1 briefing [11], she mentions the \"trade and tariff team\" but again not \"Cabinet\". \n\nWait, in search result [5], from February 25, 2025, there's a transcript where she mentions the president's Cabinet meeting and Elon Musk attending. She uses the word \"Cabinet\" multiple times in that context. For example, she says, \"the president and his Cabinet are working as one unified team\" and \"the entire administration will be in attendance tomorrow just to talk about DOGE's efforts and how all of the Cabinet secretaries are identifying waste...\" [5]. However, this is from February, not the April 22 briefing.\n\nIn the April 18 MAGA Minute video [14], Leavitt mentions companies and events but not \"Cabinet\". The April 16 briefing with Patty Morin [13] doesn't mention \"Cabinet\" either. \n\nThe key here is that the user is asking about the NEXT briefing after the query date, which is April 22. Since the current timestamp is April 22, 6:56 PM UTC, and the briefing was at 1 PM ET (which is 5 PM UTC), the briefing has already happened. However, the provided search results don't include the full transcript of the April 22 briefing. The only mention is in [2], which is a partial transcript where she talks about trade deals but doesn't use \"Cabinet\". \n\nBut wait, in the April 22 briefing transcript snippet [2], she says, \"I spoke to our entire trade team this morning there is a lot of progress being made we now have 18 proposals on paper that have been brought to the trade team again these are proposals on paper that countries have proposed to the Trump administration and to our government uh you have Secretary Bessant Secretary Lutnik Ambassador Greer NEC Director Hasset and Peter Navaro the entire trade team meeting with 34 countries this week alone...\" Here, she lists officials but doesn't mention \"Cabinet\".\n\nHowever, in the February 25 briefing [5], when asked about the Cabinet meeting, she says, \"Elon Musk is going to attend the president's first Cabinet meeting tomorrow.\" She uses \"Cabinet\" explicitly. But that's a different briefing.\n\nGiven that the user's query is about the NEXT briefing (April 22), and the provided transcripts for that day don't include the word \"Cabinet\", but the market sentiment is leaning towards \"No\", I need to check if there's any mention in the available data. Since the search results don't show her using \"Cabinet\" in the April 22 briefing, and the ancillary data says any usage counts, including plural or possessive forms, but no other forms. \n\nHowever, in the absence of explicit evidence from the April 22 briefing transcript, and considering the market's strong inclination towards \"No\", it's likely that she didn't say \"Cabinet\" during that specific briefing. Therefore, the resolution should be \"No\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.005, ID: 96991195951155634488598131501619145059941654412002614603401600042294824458615, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.995, ID: 73383542491397471924913095200269031755457779973626311369900057508999560770669, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
