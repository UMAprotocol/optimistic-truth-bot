      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether ChatGPT will remove image creation for free users in March 2025, based on the ancillary data provided. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the timeline. The event in question is between March 26 and March 31, 2025. The current date given is April 16, 2025, so the event period has already passed. That means I need to look into what actually happened during that window.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention that OpenAI introduced GPT-4o's image generation on March 25, 2025. Initially, they planned to roll it out to all users, including free tiers. However, due to unexpected high demand, the CEO Sam Altman announced delays for free users on March 26 [12][13][15][16]. Sources like TechCrunch and The Indian Express confirm that free tier access was postponed, but the feature remained available for paid users (Plus, Pro, Team) [3][11][12][15].\n\nThe key point here is whether OpenAI deliberately removed or disabled the feature for free users during the specified period. The ancillary data states that if OpenAI announces disabling, it resolves to Yes. According to the sources, OpenAI did announce a delay in rollout to free users, effectively not making it available during March 26-31. However, they didn't remove it; they just postponed the release. The feature was never enabled for free users in that period to begin with, so disabling isn't the right term. \n\nAdditionally, some sources mention that free users could still generate images using DALL-E, but the new GPT-4o feature was limited to paid tiers [15]. The note in the query specifies that only the native GPT-4o feature counts, not external integrations like DALL-E. Since the native feature wasn't available to free users during the period, but it wasn't removed\u2014it was just delayed\u2014the answer depends on the interpretation of \"removes or disables.\" If the feature was never enabled, it's a delay, not a removal. \n\nHowever, the resolution condition says if OpenAI announces disabling, it resolves to Yes. The announcement on March 26 by Altman states the rollout to free tier is delayed [12][15][16], which is an announcement about not enabling the feature rather than disabling an existing one. Therefore, the market should resolve to No (p1) because the feature wasn't removed; it was just not yet released to free users. The absence due to technical issues isn't considered, but in this case, it's a deliberate action to delay, not disable. \n\nWait, but the query's ancillary data says the market resolves to Yes if OpenAI disables it for the majority of free users between those dates. Since the feature was introduced on March 25, and the next day they delayed the free tier access, it's possible that some free users might have had access briefly before the delay was announced. However, sources indicate that the feature was rolled out to paid users first, and free access was delayed from the start [12][15]. Therefore, during March 26-31, free users didn't have access, but this was due to a delayed rollout, not a removal. The query's note says that the absence due to technical issues isn't considered, but this is a deliberate action. However, the action was to delay the rollout, not to remove an existing feature. \n\nThe resolution condition states that if OpenAI announces disabling, it resolves to Yes. The announcement was about delaying the rollout, not disabling an existing feature. Therefore, the correct resolution is No (p1), as the feature wasn't removed but was never activated for free users during that period. However, some might argue that the announcement effectively disabled it by not allowing access, but the precise terms matter. The market specifies \"removes or disables,\" implying that the feature was available and then taken away. Since it wasn't available to free users in the first place, it's a delay, not a removal. Hence, the answer should be No (p1).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744835390 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-16 20:29:50 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether ChatGPT will remove image creation for free users in March 2025, based on the ancillary data provided. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the timeline. The event in question is between March 26 and March 31, 2025. The current date given is April 16, 2025, so the event period has already passed. That means I need to look into what actually happened during that window.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention that OpenAI introduced GPT-4o's image generation on March 25, 2025. Initially, they planned to roll it out to all users, including free tiers. However, due to unexpected high demand, the CEO Sam Altman announced delays for free users on March 26 [12][13][15][16]. Sources like TechCrunch and The Indian Express confirm that free tier access was postponed, but the feature remained available for paid users (Plus, Pro, Team) [3][11][12][15].\n\nThe key point here is whether OpenAI deliberately removed or disabled the feature for free users during the specified period. The ancillary data states that if OpenAI announces disabling, it resolves to Yes. According to the sources, OpenAI did announce a delay in rollout to free users, effectively not making it available during March 26-31. However, they didn't remove it; they just postponed the release. The feature was never enabled for free users in that period to begin with, so disabling isn't the right term. \n\nAdditionally, some sources mention that free users could still generate images using DALL-E, but the new GPT-4o feature was limited to paid tiers [15]. The note in the query specifies that only the native GPT-4o feature counts, not external integrations like DALL-E. Since the native feature wasn't available to free users during the period, but it wasn't removed\u2014it was just delayed\u2014the answer depends on the interpretation of \"removes or disables.\" If the feature was never enabled, it's a delay, not a removal. \n\nHowever, the resolution condition says if OpenAI announces disabling, it resolves to Yes. The announcement on March 26 by Altman states the rollout to free tier is delayed [12][15][16], which is an announcement about not enabling the feature rather than disabling an existing one. Therefore, the market should resolve to No (p1) because the feature wasn't removed; it was just not yet released to free users. The absence due to technical issues isn't considered, but in this case, it's a deliberate action to delay, not disable. \n\nWait, but the query's ancillary data says the market resolves to Yes if OpenAI disables it for the majority of free users between those dates. Since the feature was introduced on March 25, and the next day they delayed the free tier access, it's possible that some free users might have had access briefly before the delay was announced.

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (0.930 = 93.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
