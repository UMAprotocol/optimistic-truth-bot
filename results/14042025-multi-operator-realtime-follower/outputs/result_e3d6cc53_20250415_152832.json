      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if ChatGPT removed image creation for free users in March 2025. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Yes\" if OpenAI disabled the feature for most free users in the US between March 26 and March 31. Otherwise, it's \"No.\"\n\nFirst, I need to check the timeline of events from the search results. The initial launch was on March 25 with GPT-4o image generation for paid users. Then, on March 26, there was a surge in usage, especially with the Studio Ghibli trend. Sam Altman mentioned delays for free users due to high demand and server issues. Sources [5], [11], [12], [14], and [16] all mention this delay. However, the key point is whether the feature was removed during the specified period.\n\nLooking at the dates, the delay was announced on March 26, which is within the March 26-31 window. But the free tier rollout was paused, not removed. The feature was still available to paid users. Then, on April 1, sources [2], [6], [9], [13], [15] indicate that the feature was rolled out to all free users with a limit of three images per day. Since the resolution period ends on March 31, the rollout on April 1 is outside the window. \n\nDuring March 26-31, free users didn't have access as the rollout was delayed. The ancillary data says if OpenAI disables the feature during that period, it's a \"Yes.\" The delay in rollout effectively means the feature wasn't available to free users during those dates, even though it was planned. Therefore, the answer should be \"Yes\" (p2). But wait, the initial launch on March 25 included plans for free users, but the actual rollout to them was delayed. So between March 26 and 31, free users didn't have access, which meets the resolution condition. Hence, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The user wants to know if ChatGPT removed image creation for free users in March 2025. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Yes\" if OpenAI disabled the feature for most free users in the US between March 26 and March 31. Otherwise, it's \"No.\"\n\nFirst, I need to check the timeline of events from the search results. The initial launch was on March 25 with GPT-4o image generation for paid users. Then, on March 26, there was a surge in usage, especially with the Studio Ghibli trend. Sam Altman mentioned delays for free users due to high demand and server issues. Sources [5], [11], [12], [14], and [16] all mention this delay. However, the key point is whether the feature was removed during the specified period.\n\nLooking at the dates, the delay was announced on March 26, which is within the March 26-31 window. But the free tier rollout was paused, not removed. The feature was still available to paid users. Then, on April 1, sources [2], [6], [9], [13], [15] indicate that the feature was rolled out to all free users with a limit of three images per day. Since the resolution period ends on March 31, the rollout on April 1 is outside the window. \n\nDuring March 26-31, free users didn't have access as the rollout was delayed. The ancillary data says if OpenAI disables the feature during that period, it's a \"Yes.\" The delay in rollout effectively means the feature wasn't available to free users during those dates, even though it was planned. Therefore, the answer should be \"Yes\" (p2). But wait, the initial launch on March 25 included plans for free users, but the actual rollout to them was delayed. So between March 26 and 31, free users didn't have access, which meets the resolution condition. Hence, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.07, ID: 102004668622589061237576143637109659712494805200518557961990148092514364064994, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.93, ID: 71100093799748210410746772193222540463877661048471556863788266936909862566578, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (0.930 = 93.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nIf the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
