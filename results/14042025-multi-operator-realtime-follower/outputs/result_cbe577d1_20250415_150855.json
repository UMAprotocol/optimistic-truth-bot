      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump said \"Tren de Aragua\" during his meeting with Nayib Bukele on April 14, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the sources provided. The main event is the bilateral meeting and press conference on April 14. The key sources here are the pool reports from the White House (source 9), the ABC News report (source 10), the PBS report (source 11), and the Foreign Policy article (source 12). \n\nLooking at source 9, the pool reports detail the day's events, including the meeting between Trump and Bukele. The reports mention discussions about deportation flights and cooperation on immigration, but there's no specific mention of Trump using the term \"Tren de Aragua.\" The pool entered the Oval Office and noted the topics discussed, but the exact wording isn't provided.\n\nSource 10 from ABC News covers the meeting and quotes Bukele's comments about not returning a wrongly deported individual. It mentions the deportation of Tren de Aragua members but doesn't state that Trump used the term during the event. Similarly, source 11 from PBS summarizes the meeting's focus on deportation issues but again doesn't cite Trump saying the specific phrase.\n\nSource 12 from Foreign Policy discusses the deportation flights and the context of the meeting, including Trump's admiration for Bukele. However, it doesn't mention Trump uttering \"Tren de Aragua\" during the event.\n\nOther sources like the YouTube video (source 2) and Fox News (source 6) discuss the deportation of Tren de Aragua members but don't provide transcripts of the April 14 meeting. The White House statement (source 7) and other articles focus on earlier actions in March, not the specific April 14 event.\n\nThe critical point is whether any of the sources directly quote Trump saying \"Tren de Aragua\" during the scheduled events. Since none of the provided sources indicate that Trump used the exact term during the bilateral meeting or press conference on April 14, the resolution should be \"No.\" The absence of the term in the detailed reports and transcripts suggests it wasn't mentioned during the specified events.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744729617 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-15 15:06:57 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump said \"Tren de Aragua\" during his meeting with Nayib Bukele on April 14, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the sources provided. The main event is the bilateral meeting and press conference on April 14. The key sources here are the pool reports from the White House (source 9), the ABC News report (source 10), the PBS report (source 11), and the Foreign Policy article (source 12). \n\nLooking at source 9, the pool reports detail the day's events, including the meeting between Trump and Bukele. The reports mention discussions about deportation flights and cooperation on immigration, but there's no specific mention of Trump using the term \"Tren de Aragua.\" The pool entered the Oval Office and noted the topics discussed, but the exact wording isn't provided.\n\nSource 10 from ABC News covers the meeting and quotes Bukele's comments about not returning a wrongly deported individual. It mentions the deportation of Tren de Aragua members but doesn't state that Trump used the term during the event. Similarly, source 11 from PBS summarizes the meeting's focus on deportation issues but again doesn't cite Trump saying the specific phrase.\n\nSource 12 from Foreign Policy discusses the deportation flights and the context of the meeting, including Trump's admiration for Bukele. However, it doesn't mention Trump uttering \"Tren de Aragua\" during the event.\n\nOther sources like the YouTube video (source 2) and Fox News (source 6) discuss the deportation of Tren de Aragua members but don't provide transcripts of the April 14 meeting. The White House statement (source 7) and other articles focus on earlier actions in March, not the specific April 14 event.\n\nThe critical point is whether any of the sources directly quote Trump saying \"Tren de Aragua\" during the scheduled events. Since none of the provided sources indicate that Trump used the exact term during the bilateral meeting or press conference on April 14, the resolution should be \"No.\" The absence of the term in the detailed reports and transcripts suggests it wasn't mentioned during the specified events.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.0005, ID: 73285413051823242420847290111333507794226611074792786422739025898246550035718, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.9995, ID: 3831666646731443509624253772679080194410750876244924635215897579281784066696, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.
