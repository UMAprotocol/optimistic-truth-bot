      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"President\" 80 or more times during her next White House press briefing. The resolution depends on counting each instance of the term, including pluralizations and possessives, but not other forms. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if she meets the count, \"No\" (p1) otherwise. If there's no briefing by the end of 2025 or she's no longer press secretary, it's \"No\".\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a recent press briefing that already happened. The current date is April 22, 2025. The search results include several live briefings on April 22, 2025, from sources like CNBC, NBC News, and MSNBC. These are all from today, so the next briefing after the query would be this one.\n\nNow, I need to verify if Karoline Leavitt participated in the April 22 briefing. The search results [1], [2], [3], and [8] all mention her holding a press briefing on that date. So the event occurred.\n\nNext, I need to count how many times she said \"President\" during this briefing. The search results don't provide full transcripts, but there are some excerpts. For example, in [4], a briefing from February 12, she uses \"President\" multiple times when referring to Trump and other leaders. In [7], the April 11 transcript shows her using \"President\" several times. However, the exact count for April 22 isn't directly available.\n\nLooking at [8], the MSNBC video description mentions that Leavitt denied a report about replacing Pete Hegseth. The transcript excerpts from other briefings show her frequent use of \"President\" when discussing Trump's actions. For instance, in [12], she mentions \"President Trump\" multiple times in a single briefing. \n\nGiven her role as press secretary, it's common to refer to the President frequently. However, reaching 80 instances is quite high. Without a full transcript, it's challenging to get an exact count. However, considering her past behavior and the nature of press briefings where the President's actions are a central topic, it's possible she used the term extensively. \n\nSince the user specified that the resolution source is the video of the briefing, and the briefings on April 22 are available, the next step is to check those videos. However, the provided search results don't include a transcript of the April 22 briefing. Without access to the actual video or transcript, I can't definitively count the instances. \n\nBut according to the user's instructions, if the event has occurred and there's no verifiable information, we assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. Given her pattern of frequent use of \"President\" in previous briefings, it's plausible she exceeded 80 mentions. However, without concrete evidence, there's uncertainty. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. The event date is today, April 22, which is in the past relative to the current timestamp. The search results confirm the briefing happened, but no transcript is provided. Therefore, based on her historical usage and the likelihood of discussing the President repeatedly in a briefing, the probable outcome is \"Yes\". But since there's no direct evidence, maybe p3? Wait, the resolution conditions have p3 as 0.5 (unknown), but the user's instructions say if the event occurred but no info, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data says p2 is Yes, p1 is No. Since the event happened and we have to infer, but without the transcript, it's uncertain. However, the user's instruction says if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. Given that, and her tendency to say \"President\" often, I'll recommend p2 (Yes). But I need to be careful. Alternatively, if the exact count isn't verified, maybe p4? Wait, p4 is for future events. Since the event has already occurred, and we don't have the count, but the user's instruction says if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. So, if I think it's likely she said it 80+ times, then p2. Otherwise, p1. Given her past behavior, it's possible but 80 is a high number. For example, in the February 12 briefing [4], she uses \"president\" around 20 times in the provided excerpts. If that's a 30-minute briefing, scaling up to an hour might reach 40-50. To reach 80, the briefing would need to be longer or more focused on the President. However, without the actual count, it's risky. But the user's instruction says to resolve based on the most probable outcome if no info. Given the lack of evidence, the safe answer might be p1 (No), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the briefing was lengthy and she discussed the President extensively, maybe p2. This is a tough call. Since the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome, and given that press secretaries frequently refer to the President, but 80 is a high number, I might lean towards p1 (No). However, I'm uncertain. Alternatively, if the briefing was particularly focused on the President's actions, maybe p2. Without concrete data, it's a judgment call. But per the user's instructions, if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. Given that 80 is a high threshold, and typical briefings might not reach that, I'll go with p1 (No). But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, if the briefing was longer or more intense, maybe p2. Hmm. Alternatively, check if any of the search results mention the count. None do. Therefore, based on the available info, we can't confirm, so p4? Wait, p4 is for future events. The event has occurred, so p4 isn't applicable. The options are p1, p2, p3. Since we don't have the count, but the user says to assume the most probable outcome, and given the high threshold, I think p1 (No) is more likely. Therefore, recommendation: p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745345548 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-22 18:12:28 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"President\" 80 or more times during her next White House press briefing. The resolution depends on counting each instance of the term, including pluralizations and possessives, but not other forms. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if she meets the count, \"No\" (p1) otherwise. If there's no briefing by the end of 2025 or she's no longer press secretary, it's \"No\".\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a recent press briefing that already happened. The current date is April 22, 2025. The search results include several live briefings on April 22, 2025, from sources like CNBC, NBC News, and MSNBC. These are all from today, so the next briefing after the query would be this one.\n\nNow, I need to verify if Karoline Leavitt participated in the April 22 briefing. The search results [1], [2], [3], and [8] all mention her holding a press briefing on that date. So the event occurred.\n\nNext, I need to count how many times she said \"President\" during this briefing. The search results don't provide full transcripts, but there are some excerpts. For example, in [4], a briefing from February 12, she uses \"President\" multiple times when referring to Trump and other leaders. In [7], the April 11 transcript shows her using \"President\" several times. However, the exact count for April 22 isn't directly available.\n\nLooking at [8], the MSNBC video description mentions that Leavitt denied a report about replacing Pete Hegseth. The transcript excerpts from other briefings show her frequent use of \"President\" when discussing Trump's actions. For instance, in [12], she mentions \"President Trump\" multiple times in a single briefing. \n\nGiven her role as press secretary, it's common to refer to the President frequently. However, reaching 80 instances is quite high. Without a full transcript, it's challenging to get an exact count. However, considering her past behavior and the nature of press briefings where the President's actions are a central topic, it's possible she used the term extensively. \n\nSince the user specified that the resolution source is the video of the briefing, and the briefings on April 22 are available, the next step is to check those videos. However, the provided search results don't include a transcript of the April 22 briefing. Without access to the actual video or transcript, I can't definitively count the instances. \n\nBut according to the user's instructions, if the event has occurred and there's no verifiable information, we assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. Given her pattern of frequent use of \"President\" in previous briefings, it's plausible she exceeded 80 mentions. However, without concrete evidence, there's uncertainty. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. The event date is today, April 22, which is in the past relative to the current timestamp. The search results confirm the briefing happened, but no transcript is provided. Therefore, based on her historical usage and the likelihood of discussing the President repeatedly in a briefing, the probable outcome is \"Yes\". But since there's no direct evidence, maybe p3? Wait, the resolution conditions have p3 as 0.5 (unknown), but the user's instructions say if the event occurred but no info, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data says p2 is Yes, p1 is No. Since the event happened and we have to infer, but without the transcript, it's uncertain. However, the user's instruction says if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. Given that, and her tendency to say \"President\" often, I'll recommend p2 (Yes). But I need to be careful. Alternatively, if the exact count isn't verified, maybe p4? Wait, p4 is for future events. Since the event has already occurred, and we don't have the count, but the user's instruction says if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. So, if I think it's likely she said it 80+ times, then p2. Otherwise, p1. Given her past behavior, it's possible but 80 is a high number. For example, in the February 12 briefing [4], she uses \"president\" around 20 times in the provided excerpts. If that's a 30-minute briefing, scaling up to an hour might reach 40-50. To reach 80, the briefing would need to be longer or more focused on the President. However, without the actual count, it's risky. But the user's instruction says to resolve based on the most probable outcome if no info. Given the lack of evidence, the safe answer might be p1 (No), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the briefing was lengthy and she discussed the President extensively, maybe p2. This is a tough call. Since the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome, and given that press secretaries frequently refer to the President, but 80 is a high number, I might lean towards p1 (No). However, I'm uncertain. Alternatively, if the briefing was particularly focused on the President's actions, maybe p2. Without concrete data, it's a judgment call. But per the user's instructions, if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. Given that 80 is a high threshold, and typical briefings might not reach that, I'll go with p1 (No). But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, if the briefing was longer or more intense, maybe p2. Hmm. Alternatively, check if any of the search results mention the count. None do. Therefore, based on the available info, we can't confirm, so p4? Wait, p4 is for future events. The event has occurred, so p4 isn't applicable. The options are p1, p2, p3. Since we don't have the count, but the user says to assume the most probable outcome, and given the high threshold, I think p1 (No) is more likely. Therefore, recommendation: p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.3, ID: 100588422081996390747033391818139856815359625743415697186641148918728501351999, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.7, ID: 81132721701338920223765967462913949380289908365045601394890086806971097971134, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.
