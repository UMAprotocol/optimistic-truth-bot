      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Mark Carney said the word \"Tariffs\" three or more times during the Canadian Election Debate on April 17, 2025. The resolution depends on the exact count of the term \"Tariffs\" (including plural or possessive forms) as per the provided conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of the debate transcript or specific instances where Carney used the word. The current date is April 17, 2025, so the debate happened today. The user provided several search results, but I need to focus on those related to the debate.\n\nLooking at the search results, [9] is an article from April 16 about the first French-language debate where Carney clashed with Poilievre. However, the English debate was scheduled for April 17. [10] and [14] mention the French debate on April 16, and [14] also refers to the April 17 English debate but doesn't provide a transcript. [15] discusses the French debate on April 16, and [16] mentions Carney suspending his campaign on April 1, which is before the debate.\n\nThe key here is that the search results don't include a transcript or detailed account of the April 17 English debate. The most recent relevant result is [14], which covers the French debate on April 16 but doesn't mention the English one. Since the user specified the English debate on April 17 and the resolution source is the event's video, but the provided search results don't include the transcript or any mentions of Carney's statements from that specific debate, there's no verifiable evidence in the provided sources that he said \"Tariffs\" three or more times.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, the answer should resolve to \"No\" because there's no confirmation from the sources provided. However, I need to check if any of the search results indirectly indicate his usage. For example, [10] mentions discussions about tariffs in the French debate, but that's a different event. Without explicit evidence from the April 17 debate, the safe resolution is \"No\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The user wants to know if Mark Carney said the word \"Tariffs\" three or more times during the Canadian Election Debate on April 17, 2025. The resolution depends on the exact count of the term \"Tariffs\" (including plural or possessive forms) as per the provided conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of the debate transcript or specific instances where Carney used the word. The current date is April 17, 2025, so the debate happened today. The user provided several search results, but I need to focus on those related to the debate.\n\nLooking at the search results, [9] is an article from April 16 about the first French-language debate where Carney clashed with Poilievre. However, the English debate was scheduled for April 17. [10] and [14] mention the French debate on April 16, and [14] also refers to the April 17 English debate but doesn't provide a transcript. [15] discusses the French debate on April 16, and [16] mentions Carney suspending his campaign on April 1, which is before the debate.\n\nThe key here is that the search results don't include a transcript or detailed account of the April 17 English debate. The most recent relevant result is [14], which covers the French debate on April 16 but doesn't mention the English one. Since the user specified the English debate on April 17 and the resolution source is the event's video, but the provided search results don't include the transcript or any mentions of Carney's statements from that specific debate, there's no verifiable evidence in the provided sources that he said \"Tariffs\" three or more times.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, the answer should resolve to \"No\" because there's no confirmation from the sources provided. However, I need to check if any of the search results indirectly indicate his usage. For example, [10] mentions discussions about tariffs in the French debate, but that's a different event. Without explicit evidence from the April 17 debate, the safe resolution is \"No\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.94, ID: 46492386075993746178059512082499586852272096598169698158165827337680227688660, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.06, ID: 108952436391566926754350720908896090092788656024966174697426746858965475035360, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.940 = 94.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The key sources here are the search results that detail the debate content. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nLooking at result [1], there's a detailed account of the debate. Carney discusses pipelines and trade with the U.S., but the exact word \"tariffs\" isn't mentioned in the quoted text. However, the context is about trade wars, which might involve tariffs. But without the exact term, it's not counted.\n\nResult [4] is a YouTube video transcript snippet. Carney talks about Trump's trade war, but again, the word \"tariffs\" isn't explicitly used in the provided text. The same goes for result [8], another video transcript where trade issues are discussed, but the term isn't present in the excerpts.\n\nResult [15] from CityNews Toronto mentions the debate and Carney's response to tariffs, but the quoted sections don't include him saying \"tariffs.\" Similarly, result [16] by Reuters covers the debate but doesn't quote Carney using the word.\n\nResult [18] discusses the debate and Carney's policies but again doesn't mention him using \"tariffs.\" The other results either discuss pre-debate actions or post-debate analysis without specific quotes from the debate itself.\n\nNow, considering the user's instruction to check the video transcript if available, none of the provided search results include a full transcript. The closest is result [1], which has detailed quotes but no instances of \"tariffs.\" The user's ancillary data specifies that the resolution source is the event video, but without access to the video or a full transcript, I have to rely on the provided search results.\n\nSince none of the available sources explicitly state that Carney used the word \"tariffs\" three or more times during the debate, and given the requirement for exact term usage, the answer would lean towards \"No.\" However, there's a possibility that the term was used in parts of the debate not covered in the provided excerpts. But based on the evidence at hand, the safe conclusion is that he didn't meet the threshold.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The user wants to know if Mark Carney said the word \"Tariffs\" three or more times during the Canadian Election Debate on April 17, 2025. The resolution depends on the exact count of that specific term in his speech during the event.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mentions of Carney's statements during the debate. The key sources here are the search results that detail the debate content. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nLooking at result [1], there's a detailed account of the debate. Carney discusses pipelines and trade with the U.S., but the exact word \"tariffs\" isn't mentioned in the quoted text. However, the context is about trade wars, which might involve tariffs. But without the exact term, it's not counted.\n\nResult [4] is a YouTube video transcript snippet. Carney talks about Trump's trade war, but again, the word \"tariffs\" isn't explicitly used in the provided text. The same goes for result [8], another video transcript where trade issues are discussed, but the term isn't present in the excerpts.\n\nResult [15] from CityNews Toronto mentions the debate and Carney's response to tariffs, but the quoted sections don't include him saying \"tariffs.\" Similarly, result [16] by Reuters covers the debate but doesn't quote Carney using the word.\n\nResult [18] discusses the debate and Carney's policies but again doesn't mention him using \"tariffs.\" The other results either discuss pre-debate actions or post-debate analysis without specific quotes from the debate itself.\n\nNow, considering the user's instruction to check the video transcript if available, none of the provided search results include a full transcript. The closest is result [1], which has detailed quotes but no instances of \"tariffs.\" The user's ancillary data specifies that the resolution source is the event video, but without access to the video or a full transcript, I have to rely on the provided search results.\n\nSince none of the available sources explicitly state that Carney used the word \"tariffs\" three or more times during the debate, and given the requirement for exact term usage, the answer would lean towards \"No.\" However, there's a possibility that the term was used in parts of the debate not covered in the provided excerpts. But based on the evidence at hand, the safe conclusion is that he didn't meet the threshold.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.94, ID: 46492386075993746178059512082499586852272096598169698158165827337680227688660, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.06, ID: 108952436391566926754350720908896090092788656024966174697426746858965475035360, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.940 = 94.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

However, the user's query requires three or more mentions. The provided search results don't show additional instances of \"tariffs\" in the April 17 debate.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Mark Carney said the word \"Tariffs\" three or more times during the Canadian Election Debate on April 17, 2025. The resolution depends on the exact count of the term \"Tariffs\" (including plural or possessive forms) in his speech during that specific event.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mention of the debate transcript or summaries. The user mentioned that the English-language debate was on April 17, so I should focus on sources from that date. \n\nLooking at the search results, several entries mention the French-language debate on April 16 (sources 5, 8, 13, 14, 15, 16), but the English one was on April 17. However, the search results provided don't include a direct transcript of the April 17 debate. The latest entries are from April 17 but refer to the French debate or other topics. \n\nFor example, source 3 is a podcast with Carney on April 17 discussing trade tensions, but it's not the debate. Source 1 and 8 discuss the French debate on April 16. Sources 14 and 15 mention the French debate details but not the English one. There's no available transcript or detailed account of the April 17 English debate in the provided data. \n\nSince the resolution source is the video of the event, and the provided context doesn't include the transcript, I can't confirm the exact number of times \"Tariffs\" was said. Without explicit evidence from the debate transcript, the answer defaults to p4 (cannot resolve) if the event hasn't occurred yet. However, the current timestamp is April 17, 2025, 23:07:10 UTC, and the debate was at 7:00 PM ET, which is 23:00 UTC. So the debate occurred just before the current time. \n\nBut since there's no available data in the search results confirming Carney's usage, and the user specified that if no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. Given Carney's focus on tariffs in his campaign (sources 1, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12), it's likely he mentioned \"tariffs\" multiple times. However, without the actual transcript, strictly following the rules, if the event has occurred but no sources confirm the count, the resolution should be p4. But the user's instruction says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. Given the context, the probable answer is \"Yes\" (p2), but since the search results don't provide the transcript, it's uncertain. However, the user's personalization says to use provided URLs heavily. The user provided a URL in the ancillary data (globalnews.ca), but that's not in the search results. Since the search results don't include the debate transcript, and the event has passed, but no sources confirm the count, the safe answer is p4. Wait, but the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since Carney has been consistently discussing tariffs, it's probable he said it 3+ times. But without explicit evidence, the correct resolution is p4. However, the user's instruction says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. So, given the context, the answer is p2 (Yes). But I need to check the exact rules again.\n\nThe user's personalization states: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" Since the event occurred, and given Carney's focus on tariffs in all prior debates and statements, it's highly probable he used the term at least three times. Therefore, the recommendation is p2 (Yes).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if he did, \"No\" (p1) if not, and p3 if uncertain.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for mentions of Carney's statements during the debate. The debate in question is the French-language one held on April 17, as per the user's query. The English debate was scheduled for the same day but later in the evening, but the user's timestamp is 23:07:10 UTC, which is 7:07 PM ET, so the English debate might not have occurred yet. However, the search results focus on the French debate.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the debate. For example, result [1] mentions the French debate where Carney discussed Trump's trade war. Result [4] is a video titled \"Mark Carney on the defensive at French-language debate\" which includes a transcript snippet where Carney talks about Trump's trade war and tariffs. Result [6] quotes Carney discussing counter-tariffs and the need to act against U.S. tariffs. Result [7] mentions Carney's plan to build a stronger economy to deal with Trump, implying discussions around tariffs. Result [8] includes a quote from Carney about retaliatory tariffs on Quebec aluminum. Result [13] states that Carney retaliated with counter-tariffs and Poilievre would take a similar approach. Result [15] notes Carney's response to tariffs and his experience in crises.\n\nCrucially, result [6] explicitly mentions Carney discussing counter-tariffs and the need to act, which would involve using the term \"tariffs.\" Result [8] has Carney talking about counter-tariffs on aluminum, which again uses the term. Result [13] mentions Carney's retaliation with counter-tariffs. Each of these instances would count towards the total. Additionally, result [4] includes a transcript where Carney refers to Trump's tariffs, and result [7] has him discussing the trade war, which likely involves the term. \n\nConsidering pluralization and possessive forms are allowed, \"tariffs\" in any form counts. The key is to count each occurrence. From the sources, there are multiple mentions of Carney discussing tariffs, counter-tariffs, and the trade war, which would require using the term. Given that the debate was dominated by trade issues with the U.S., it's highly probable that Carney used \"tariffs\" at least three times. The absence of a direct transcript makes exact count challenging, but the preponderance of evidence from multiple sources indicates he did mention the term multiple times. Therefore, the recommendation is p2 (Yes).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744931230 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-17 23:07:10 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p2. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query.

Try other solvers or a combination approach.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: perplexity\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",

The solver's decision to recommend 'p2' (Yes) is based on assumptions about Mark Carney's previous focus on tariffs rather than concrete evidence from the debate itself. This approach contradicts the requirement for verifiable facts in resolving the query. Furthermore, the response does not align with the strong market sentiment, which heavily favors a 'Yes' outcome with 94% confidence.",

The solver has appropriately considered the pluralization and possessive forms of the term 'tariffs' as specified in the query. However, the response could be improved by directly counting instances from a transcript or more direct evidence rather than inferring from related discussion topics. Nonetheless, the analysis appears thorough given the available information.",
