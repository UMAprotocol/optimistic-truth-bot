      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump said the word \"Hispanic\" during his FOX Noticias interview on April 15 and 16, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if he did, \"No\" (p1) if not, and p3 if it's uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mention of Trump using \"Hispanic\" in the interview. The search results include several sources about the interview. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nResult [1] mentions Trump's interview on Fox Noticias, where he tried to say \"Make America Great Again\" in Spanish. It talks about his policies on immigration and mentions a meeting with El Salvador's president, but there's no direct quote of him saying \"Hispanic.\"\n\nResult [2] is about the launch of Fox Noticias but doesn't include interview content.\n\nResult [3] discusses Fox Noticias' launch and Trump's appeal to Latino voters but doesn't mention the specific interview in question.\n\nResult [4] is a transcript of a 2023 Univision interview where Trump uses \"Hispanic\" and \"Latino\" interchangeably. However, this is a different interview and time frame, so it's not relevant here.\n\nResult [5] is a scoop about the upcoming interview, mentioning topics like tariffs and immigration but no transcript or quotes.\n\nResult [6] refers to a 2024 town hall where Trump talks about Hispanic voters, but again, it's a different event.\n\nResult [7] is about a 2024 roundtable in Nevada, not the 2025 Fox Noticias interview.\n\nResult [8] discusses a 2024 Univision town hall, not the relevant interview.\n\nResult [9] is the press release announcing the interview, stating a transcript would be available. If the transcript is part of the search results, I need to check if it's included.\n\nResult [10] and [11] describe the segment where Campos-Duffy teaches Trump the Spanish version of MAGA. Trump says \"Am\u00e9rica grande otra vez\" but no mention of \"Hispanic.\"\n\nResult [12] is a transcript from the Will Cain Show, not the Fox Noticias interview. Here, Trump uses \"Hispanic\" and \"Latino,\" but this is a different show.\n\nResult [13] and [15] recap the MAGA translation moment without mentioning \"Hispanic.\"\n\nResult [14] is about a Super Bowl interview, unrelated.\n\nLooking at result [9], the Fox press release mentions a transcript would be available.

Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744840667 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-16 21:57:47 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump said the word \"Hispanic\" during his FOX Noticias interview on April 15 and 16, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if he did, \"No\" (p1) if not, and p3 if it's uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mention of Trump using \"Hispanic\" in the interview. The search results include several sources about the interview. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nResult [1] mentions Trump's interview on Fox Noticias, where he tried to say \"Make America Great Again\" in Spanish. It talks about his policies on immigration and mentions a meeting with El Salvador's president, but there's no direct quote of him saying \"Hispanic.\"\n\nResult [2] is about the launch of Fox Noticias but doesn't include interview content.\n\nResult [3] discusses Fox Noticias' launch and Trump's appeal to Latino voters but doesn't mention the specific interview in question.\n\nResult [4] is a transcript of a 2023 Univision interview where Trump uses \"Hispanic\" and \"Latino\" interchangeably. However, this is a different interview and time frame, so it's not relevant here.\n\nResult [5] is a scoop about the upcoming interview, mentioning topics like tariffs and immigration but no transcript or quotes.\n\nResult [6] refers to a 2024 town hall where Trump talks about Hispanic voters, but again, it's a different event.\n\nResult [7] is about a 2024 roundtable in Nevada, not the 2025 Fox Noticias interview.\n\nResult [8] discusses a 2024 Univision town hall, not the relevant interview.\n\nResult [9] is the press release announcing the interview, stating a transcript would be available. If the transcript is part of the search results, I need to check if it's included.\n\nResult [10] and [11] describe the segment where Campos-Duffy teaches Trump the Spanish version of MAGA. Trump says \"Am\u00e9rica grande otra vez\" but no mention of \"Hispanic.\"\n\nResult [12] is a transcript from the Will Cain Show, not the Fox Noticias interview. Here, Trump uses \"Hispanic\" and \"Latino,\" but this is a different show.\n\nResult [13] and [15] recap the MAGA translation moment without mentioning \"Hispanic.\"\n\nResult [14] is about a Super Bowl interview, unrelated.\n\nLooking at result [9], the Fox press release mentions a transcript would be available. However, in the provided search results, the actual transcript isn't included. The only transcripts are from other interviews (results [4] and [12]). \n\nThe key here is whether in the specific Fox Noticias interview, Trump used the word \"Hispanic.\" None of the search results directly quote him saying it during that interview. They discuss his policies, the viral moment, and other topics, but no mention of the exact term. \n\nSince the resolution source is the audio/video of the interview, and the provided search results don't include the transcript or direct evidence of him saying \"Hispanic,\" I have to conclude based on available information. Without the transcript, and given that none of the sources mention him using the term in this specific interview, the answer would be \"No\" (p1). However, result [12] shows Trump has used \"Hispanic\" in other contexts, but that's not this interview. \n\nWait, result [12] is from the Will Cain Show, which is a different program.

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744840667 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-16 21:57:47 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please reevaluate the available sources or seek additional information that might explain the strong market sentiment favoring a 'Yes' outcome.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said the word \"Hispanic\" during his Fox Noticias interview on April 15 and 16, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" if not. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The key sources here are the transcripts and reports about the interview. Let's go through each relevant source.\n\nLooking at source [3], it mentions Campos-Duffy teaching Trump to say \"Make America Great Again\" in Spanish. There's no mention of him using \"Hispanic\" here. Source [9] and [10] also discuss the MAGA translation but don't note \"Hispanic.\"\n\nSource [13] has a transcript snippet from the interview. Trump talks about Hispanic Americans, saying, \"Hispanics, you know there\u2019s about 15 different names... Latin Americans, South Americans, Hispanics...\" Here, he clearly uses the term \"Hispanics.\" \n\nOther sources like [6] and [7] discuss Trump's outreach to Latino voters but don't specifically mention the use of \"Hispanic\" in the interview. However, the critical point is the transcript in [13], which directly quotes Trump using \"Hispanics.\" \n\nThe resolution conditions state that any usage of the term counts, regardless of context. Since the transcript shows Trump said \"Hispanics,\" the answer should be \"Yes.\" Also, the interview was released as scheduled, so no cancellation issues. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p2 (Yes).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.995, ID: 11726722024491857335723096741156138781152226501021460565799508897185565905446, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.005, ID: 80746055711126172436373713653979979991750853254036122727570157975823212090069, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
