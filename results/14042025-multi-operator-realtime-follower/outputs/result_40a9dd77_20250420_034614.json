Your task is to analyze the provided query and decide which AI solver is best suited to handle it.\n\nAvailable solvers: perplexity\n\nSolver descriptions:\n- perplexity: Uses the Perplexity AI search engine to find information online to answer general questions. Best for:\n  * Historical data and events\n  * General knowledge questions requiring context\n  * Questions needing interpretation of complex information\n  * Has knowledge cutoff and may not have very recent information\n\n- code_runner: Executes code to fetch real-time data from specific APIs. Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Available Crypto Data Sources:\n    - Binance: Provides cryptocurrency price data for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies\n  * Available Sports Data Sources:\n    - Sports Data IO - MLB (baseball): MLB baseball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NBA (basketball): NBA basketball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NFL (football): NFL football scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NHL (hockey): NHL hockey scores, statistics, and game data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: San Francisco Giants vs. Los Angeles Angels, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for April 19 at 9:38PM ET:\nIf the San Francisco Giants win, the market will resolve to \"San Francisco Giants\".\nIf the Los Angeles Angels win, the market will resolve to \"Los Angeles Angels\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Los Angeles Angels, p2 to San Francisco Giants, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",

This is critical for reliability:\n   - Always try the proxy endpoint first\n   - If the proxy fails, fall back to the primary endpoint\n   - Use appropriate timeout values (10 seconds recommended)\n   - Include proper error handling with try/except blocks\n\nThe code should be completely self-contained and runnable with no arguments.\n\n\nHere's a complete code example that shows how to solve this type of problem:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nimport re\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport logging\n\n# Load API key from .env file\nload_dotenv()\nAPI_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\n\n# Check if API key is available\nif not API_KEY:\n    raise ValueError(\n        \"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY not found in environment variables. \"\n        \"Please add it to your .env file.\"\n    )\n\n# Constants - RESOLUTION MAPPING using internal abbreviations\nRESOLUTION_MAP = {\n    \"TOR\": \"p1\",  # Blue Jays (Home team) maps to p1\n    \"BAL\": \"p2\",  # Orioles (Away team) maps to p2\n    \"50-50\": \"p3\",  # Tie or undetermined maps to p3\n    \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\",  # Incomplete data maps to p4\n}\n\n# Sensitive data patterns to mask in logs\nSENSITIVE_PATTERNS = [\n    re.compile(r\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"Authorization\\s*:\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    # Add more patterns as needed\n]\n\nclass SensitiveDataFilter(logging.Filter):\n    def filter(self, record):\n        original_msg = record.getMessage()\n        masked_msg = original_msg\n        for pattern in SENSITIVE_PATTERNS:\n            masked_msg = pattern.sub(\"******\", masked_msg)\n        record.msg = masked_msg\n        return True\n\n# Configure logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nconsole_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\nconsole_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nconsole_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\nconsole_handler.addFilter(SensitiveDataFilter())\n\nlogger.addHandler(console_handler)\n\n\ndef get_team_abbreviation_map():\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches MLB team data and builds a mapping from full team names to API abbreviations.\n    \n    Returns:\n        Dictionary mapping full team names to API abbreviations\n    \"\"\"\n    url = f\"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json/teams?key={API_KEY}\"\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        teams = response.json()\n        # Build mapping from full team name to API abbreviation\n        return {f\"{team['City']} {team['Name']}\": team['Key'] for team in teams}\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Failed to fetch team abbreviations: {e}\")\n        return {}\n\ndef fetch_game_data(date, team1_name, team2_name, team_abbreviation_map=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches game data for the specified date and teams.\n\n    Args:\n        date: Game date in YYYY-MM-DD format\n        team1_name: First team name (full name or abbreviation)\n        team2_name: Second team name (full name or abbreviation)\n        team_abbreviation_map: Optional mapping of team names to abbreviations\n\n    Returns:\n        Game data dictionary or None if not found\n    \"\"\"\n    logger.info(f\"Fetching game data for game between {team1_name} and {team2_name} on {date}\")\n    \n    # If we don't have a team abbreviation map, try to get one\n    if team_abbreviation_map is None:\n        team_abbreviation_map = get_team_abbreviation_map()\n    \n    # Convert team names to abbreviations if needed\n    team1_api = team_abbreviation_map.get(team1_name, team1_name)\n    team2_api = team_abbreviation_map.get(team2_name, team2_name)\n    \n    logger.info(f\"Using team abbreviations: {team1_api} and {team2_api}\")\n\n    # Use the exact format from the API documentation with key as query parameter\n    url = f\"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/stats/json/BoxScoresFinal/{date}?key={API_KEY}\"\n    \n    # Mask API key in logs\n    masked_url = url.replace(API_KEY, \"******\")\n    logger.debug(f\"Using API endpoint: {masked_url}\")\n\n    try:\n        logger.debug(\"Sending API request\")\n        response = requests.get(url)\n\n        if response.status_code == 404:\n            logger.warning(\n                f\"No data found for {date}.

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: San Francisco Giants vs. Los Angeles Angels, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for April 19 at 9:38PM ET:\nIf the San Francisco Giants win, the market will resolve to \"San Francisco Giants\".\nIf the Los Angeles Angels win, the market will resolve to \"Los Angeles Angels\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Los Angeles Angels, p2 to San Francisco Giants, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality.

Recommendation found: p4.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p4\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: San Francisco Giants, Price: 0.87, ID: 54935213141325861488776821639722142914299844042676834734678538911062372152720, Winner: No\n- Token: Los Angeles Angels, Price: 0.13, ID: 32272096774025652787057885072129715422468828850714972205041425149861879964451, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Los Angeles Angels, p2 to San Francisco Giants, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Los Angeles Angels, p2 = San Francisco Giants\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors San Francisco Giants outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.870 = 87.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: San Francisco Giants vs. Los Angeles Angels, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for April 19 at 9:38PM ET:\nIf the San Francisco Giants win, the market will resolve to \"San Francisco Giants\".\nIf the Los Angeles Angels win, the market will resolve to \"Los Angeles Angels\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Los Angeles Angels, p2 to San Francisco Giants, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745120454 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-20 03:40:54 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport logging\n\n# Load API key from .env file\nload_dotenv()\nMLB_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\n\n# Constants - RESOLUTION MAPPING using team names\nRESOLUTION_MAP = {\n    \"SFG\": \"p2\",  # San Francisco Giants win maps to p2\n    \"LAA\": \"p1\",  # Los Angeles Angels win maps to p1\n    \"50-50\": \"p3\",  # Tie or undetermined maps to p3\n    \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\",  # Incomplete data maps to p4\n}\n\n# Configure logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\nhandler = logging.StreamHandler()\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nhandler.setFormatter(formatter)\nlogger.addHandler(handler)\n\ndef fetch_game_data():\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches game data for the specified date and teams.\n    \"\"\"\n    date = \"2025-04-19\"\n    team1 = \"SFG\"\n    team2 = \"LAA\"\n    url = f\"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json/GamesByDate/{date}?key={MLB_API_KEY}\"\n\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        games = response.json()\n\n        for game in games:\n            if game['HomeTeam'] == team1 and game['AwayTeam'] == team2 or game['HomeTeam'] == team2 and game['AwayTeam'] == team1:\n                return game\n        return None\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        logger.error(f\"API request failed: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef determine_resolution(game):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the resolution based on the game's status and outcome.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not game:\n        return \"recommendation: p4\"\n\n    status = game.get(\"Status\")\n    if status == \"Final\":\n        home_team = game.get(\"HomeTeam\")\n        away_team = game.get(\"AwayTeam\")\n        home_score = game.get(\"HomeTeamRuns\")\n        away_score = game.get(\"AwayTeamRuns\")\n\n        if home_score > away_score:\n            return f\"recommendation: {RESOLUTION_MAP.get(home_team, 'p3')}\"\n        elif away_score > home_score:\n            return f\"recommendation: {RESOLUTION_MAP.get(away_team, 'p3')}\"\n        else:\n            return \"recommendation: p3\"\n    elif status in [\"Canceled\", \"Postponed\"]:\n        return \"recommendation: p3\"\n    else:\n        return \"recommendation: p4\"\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to query MLB game data and determine the resolution.\n    \"\"\"\n    game_data = fetch_game_data()\n    resolution = determine_resolution(game_data)\n    print(resolution)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p4\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: San Francisco Giants vs. Los Angeles Angels, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for April 19 at 9:38PM ET:\nIf the San Francisco Giants win, the market will resolve to \"San Francisco Giants\".\nIf the Los Angeles Angels win, the market will resolve to \"Los Angeles Angels\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Los Angeles Angels, p2 to San Francisco Giants, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745120454 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-20 03:40:54 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4.

Recommendation found: p4.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p4\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: San Francisco Giants, Price: 0.87, ID: 54935213141325861488776821639722142914299844042676834734678538911062372152720, Winner: No\n- Token: Los Angeles Angels, Price: 0.13, ID: 32272096774025652787057885072129715422468828850714972205041425149861879964451, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Los Angeles Angels, p2 to San Francisco Giants, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Los Angeles Angels, p2 = San Francisco Giants\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors San Francisco Giants outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.870 = 87.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3.

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: San Francisco Giants vs. Los Angeles Angels, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for April 19 at 9:38PM ET:\nIf the San Francisco Giants win, the market will resolve to \"San Francisco Giants\".\nIf the Los Angeles Angels win, the market will resolve to \"Los Angeles Angels\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Los Angeles Angels, p2 to San Francisco Giants, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745120454 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-20 03:40:54 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p1. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p1.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1.
