      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump said the word \"Japan\" during his FOX Noticias interview on April 15 and 16, 2025. The resolution depends on whether the term was mentioned, regardless of context, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mention of the interview content. The key sources here are [2], [5], [14], and maybe others that reference the interview. \n\nLooking at [2], it's a press release about the interview, but the transcript isn't included. The same with [14], which is another PR announcement. [5] from Axios mentions the interview will cover tariffs, immigration, etc., but doesn't provide the transcript. [10] and [12] discuss Trump's comments on tariffs and China, but not specifically mentioning \"Japan\" in the interview. \n\nThe search results don't include the actual transcript or video of the interview. Without the primary source (the interview itself), I can't confirm if \"Japan\" was said. The user specified that the resolution source is the audio/video, which isn't provided here. \n\nSince there's no evidence from the search results that Trump said \"Japan\" during the interview, and the interview was released as scheduled (no cancellation mentioned), the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). However, the user's personalization instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. But since the resolution requires direct evidence, and none is found, the safe answer is p4. Wait, no\u2014the resolution conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 50-50. But according to the personalization rules, if the event happened and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. However, without the transcript, we can't confirm. The user's instructions say if no verifiable info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But the query is factual\u2014either he said it or not. Since there's no data, maybe p3? Wait, the resolution conditions have p3 as 0.5, but the user's ancillary data says p3 is for unknown/50-50. However, the personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But how can we assume? The query is about whether he said a specific word. Without the transcript, we can't know. The instructions say if no verifiable info, answer as per the conditions. Since the interview was released but no transcript is provided in the search results, and the user can't access it, the resolution would be based on available data. Since the search results don't mention \"Japan\" in the interview, but the interview was about trade talks with Japan (as per [1], [6], etc.), it's possible he mentioned Japan. But without direct evidence, per the rules, if no verifiable info, resolve to p4? Wait, the personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But the market resolution requires the audio/video as the source. Since the provided search results don't include the transcript, and the user can't verify, the answer should be p4 (cannot resolve). But the personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, the market's resolution conditions specify that if the interview wasn't released by the deadline, resolve to No. The interview was released, so that's not the case. Since the user provided search results don't include the transcript, and we can't confirm, the correct resolution is p3 (unknown). But the resolution conditions have p3 as 0.5, which is for 50-50. However, the user's personalization says if no info, default to p4. Wait, the personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" Here, the event date is in the past (April 15-16, 2025), and the current date is April 17. The interview was released, so the market resolves based on what aired. Since the search results don't provide the transcript, but other sources ([1], [6], [8], [10]) discuss Trump's recent talks with Japan, it's possible he mentioned Japan in the interview. However, without the actual transcript, we can't confirm. The user's instructions say to resolve based on the provided sources. Since none of the sources directly indicate Trump said \"Japan\" in the interview, the answer should be p1 (No). But wait, [1] mentions the interview with Fox Noticias in the context of trade talks with Japan. However, that's a different source (Fox Business) and not the actual interview transcript. The Axios article [5] says the interview covered tariffs, which could relate to Japan, but again, no direct mention. Without explicit evidence, the resolution should be p1 (No). But I'm conflicted because the context suggests he might have, but the rules require direct evidence. Therefore, the recommendation is p1: No.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744865127 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-17 04:45:27 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump said the word \"Japan\" during his FOX Noticias interview on April 15 and 16, 2025. The resolution depends on whether the term was mentioned, regardless of context, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mention of the interview content. The key sources here are [2], [5], [14], and maybe others that reference the interview. \n\nLooking at [2], it's a press release about the interview, but the transcript isn't included. The same with [14], which is another PR announcement. [5] from Axios mentions the interview will cover tariffs, immigration, etc., but doesn't provide the transcript. [10] and [12] discuss Trump's comments on tariffs and China, but not specifically mentioning \"Japan\" in the interview. \n\nThe search results don't include the actual transcript or video of the interview. Without the primary source (the interview itself), I can't confirm if \"Japan\" was said. The user specified that the resolution source is the audio/video, which isn't provided here. \n\nSince there's no evidence from the search results that Trump said \"Japan\" during the interview, and the interview was released as scheduled (no cancellation mentioned), the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). However, the user's personalization instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. But since the resolution requires direct evidence, and none is found, the safe answer is p4. Wait, no\u2014the resolution conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 50-50. But according to the personalization rules, if the event happened and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. However, without the transcript, we can't confirm. The user's instructions say if no verifiable info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But the query is factual\u2014either he said it or not. Since there's no data, maybe p3? Wait, the resolution conditions have p3 as 0.5, but the user's ancillary data says p3 is for unknown/50-50. However, the personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But how can we assume? The query is about whether he said a specific word. Without the transcript, we can't know. The instructions say if no verifiable info, answer as per the conditions. Since the interview was released but no transcript is provided in the search results, and the user can't access it, the resolution would be based on available data. Since the search results don't mention \"Japan\" in the interview, but the interview was about trade talks with Japan (as per [1], [6], etc.), it's possible he mentioned Japan. But without direct evidence, per the rules, if no verifiable info, resolve to p4? Wait, the personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But the market resolution requires the audio/video as the source. Since the provided search results don't include the transcript, and the user can't verify, the answer should be p4 (cannot resolve). But the personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, the market's resolution conditions specify that if the interview wasn't released by the deadline, resolve to No. The interview was released, so that's not the case. Since the user provided search results don't include the transcript, and we can't confirm, the correct resolution is p3 (unknown). But the resolution conditions have p3 as 0.5, which is for 50-50. However, the user's personalization says if no info, default to p4. Wait, the personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" Here, the event date is in the past (April 15-16, 2025), and the current date is April 17.

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market is relatively uncertain (YES: 0.490, NO: 0.510)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
