      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Oilers vs. Sharks game on April 16, 2025. The current date is April 17, 2025, so the game should have already happened. Let me check the search results to find the actual result.\n\nLooking at the search results, result [15] from thescore.com shows the game ended with Oilers 2 and Sharks 0 after the 2nd period. Wait, that's odd. The game was scheduled for April 16, 10:30 PM ET, which would be April 17 in UTC. The current timestamp is April 17, 4:53 AM UTC. The game might still be in progress or the data might be incomplete. But result [15] mentions \"End 2nd\" with Oilers leading 2-0. However, other sources like [2] and [15] indicate the game was on April 16, but the detailed box score in [2] shows the final score as 1-0 for Oilers, but that might be a placeholder. Wait, no, looking at [2], the CBS Sports box score shows the game as Oilers 1, Sharks 0 with periods 1, 2, 3 listed as 1-0-0 for Oilers and 0-0-0 for Sharks. But that might be a live update that wasn't completed. However, result [15] from thescore.com shows the game ended with Oilers 2-0 after two periods, but that's not possible because a game has three periods. Maybe the data is incomplete or there was an error in the feed.\n\nWait, result [15] is from thescore.com and shows the game as \"End 2nd\" with Oilers leading 2-0. But the current time is April 17, 4:53 AM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. The game should have concluded. Let me check other sources. Result [2] from CBS Sports has a box score that shows the final score as Oilers 1, Sharks 0, but the period breakdown is 1-0-0, which doesn't add up. Maybe that's a mistake. Alternatively, result [15] might have the correct final score. Wait, looking at result [15] again, it says \"End 2nd\" but the time is listed as 7:30 PM, which might be local time. The game was scheduled for 10:30 PM ET, which is 2:30 AM UTC on April 17. The current timestamp is 4:53 AM UTC, so the game should be over. However, the search results don't have a clear final score. Some sources like [2] and [15] show partial scores, but no definitive result. \n\nWait, result [2] from CBS Sports mentions the Oilers won 1-0, but the period breakdown is 1-0-0, which might be a placeholder. The detailed play-by-play in [2] doesn't show a full game report. Other sources like [7], [10], [13], [14] are predictions before the game. The only post-game source is [15], which is incomplete. \n\nGiven that the user provided a URL in the query, but the search results don't have a conclusive final score, I need to check if there's any other source. Wait, result [15] from thescore.com shows the final score as Oilers 2, Sharks 0, but it's listed as \"End 2nd\". That's confusing. Maybe the game was called off after two periods due to some issue, but that's rare. Alternatively, the data might be incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, looking at result [15], the \"Closing Odds\" section lists EDM -225, o/u 6.5, which is consistent with pre-game odds. The \"Team Stats\" show Shots on Goal as 17-12 for Oilers, but that's after two periods. Without a complete third period report, it's unclear. However, the user's current time is after the game's scheduled end, so the game should have a result. \n\nSince the search results don't provide a clear final score, but the user's personalization instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available. The Oilers were heavy favorites, and the Sharks were on a 10-game losing streak. The most probable outcome is an Oilers win. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Oilers\" (p2). However, the user's instructions also state that if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nBut wait, the search results do have some data. Result [15] shows Oilers leading 2-0 after two periods. If the game continued, the Oilers likely won. However, without a confirmed final score, it's risky. But according to the user's instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome, assume the most probable outcome. Since the Oilers were favored and the Sharks were struggling, the resolution would be p2 (Oilers). \n\nHowever, the user's personalization also mentions that if the event is scheduled for the same day but a later time, it's still future. But the current timestamp is April 17, 4:53 AM UTC, and the game was scheduled for April 16, 10:30 PM ET (which is April 17, 2:30 AM UTC). So the game should have concluded. The search results might not have updated yet. Given that, and the partial scores indicating Oilers were leading, the resolution should be Oilers win (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Where p1 corresponds to Sharks, p2 to Oilers, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744865493 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-17 04:51:33 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query.

Wait, that's odd. The game was scheduled for April 16, 10:30 PM ET, which would be April 17 in UTC. The current timestamp is April 17, 4:53 AM UTC. The game might still be in progress or the data might be incomplete. But result [15] mentions \"End 2nd\" with Oilers leading 2-0. However, other sources like [2] and [15] indicate the game was on April 16, but the detailed box score in [2] shows the final score as 1-0 for Oilers, but that might be a placeholder. Wait, no, looking at [2], the CBS Sports box score shows the game as Oilers 1, Sharks 0 with periods 1, 2, 3 listed as 1-0-0 for Oilers and 0-0-0 for Sharks. But that might be a live update that wasn't completed. However, result [15] from thescore.com shows the game ended with Oilers 2-0 after two periods, but that's not possible because a game has three periods. Maybe the data is incomplete or there was an error in the feed.\n\nWait, result [15] is from thescore.com and shows the game as \"End 2nd\" with Oilers leading 2-0. But the current time is April 17, 4:53 AM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. The game should have concluded. Let me check other sources. Result [2] from CBS Sports has a box score that shows the final score as Oilers 1, Sharks 0, but the period breakdown is 1-0-0, which doesn't add up. Maybe that's a mistake. Alternatively, result [15] might have the correct final score. Wait, looking at result [15] again, it says \"End 2nd\" but the time is listed as 7:30 PM, which might be local time. The game was scheduled for 10:30 PM ET, which is 2:30 AM UTC on April 17. The current timestamp is 4:53 AM UTC, so the game should be over. However, the search results don't have a clear final score. Some sources like [2] and [15] show partial scores, but no definitive result. \n\nWait, result [2] from CBS Sports mentions the Oilers won 1-0, but the period breakdown is 1-0-0, which might be a placeholder. The detailed play-by-play in [2] doesn't show a full game report. Other sources like [7], [10], [13], [14] are predictions before the game. The only post-game source is [15], which is incomplete. \n\nGiven that the user provided a URL in the query, but the search results don't have a conclusive final score, I need to check if there's any other source. Wait, result [15] from thescore.com shows the final score as Oilers 2, Sharks 0, but it's listed as \"End 2nd\". That's confusing. Maybe the game was called off after two periods due to some issue, but that's rare. Alternatively, the data might be incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, looking at result [15], the \"Closing Odds\" section lists EDM -225, o/u 6.5, which is consistent with pre-game odds. The \"Team Stats\" show Shots on Goal as 17-12 for Oilers, but that's after two periods. Without a complete third period report, it's unclear. However, the user's current time is after the game's scheduled end, so the game should have a result. \n\nSince the search results don't provide a clear final score, but the user's personalization instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available. The Oilers were heavy favorites, and the Sharks were on a 10-game losing streak. The most probable outcome is an Oilers win. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Oilers\" (p2). However, the user's instructions also state that if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nBut wait, the search results do have some data. Result [15] shows Oilers leading 2-0 after two periods. If the game continued, the Oilers likely won. However, without a confirmed final score, it's risky. But according to the user's instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome, assume the most probable outcome. Since the Oilers were favored and the Sharks were struggling, the resolution would be p2 (Oilers). \n\nHowever, the user's personalization also mentions that if the event is scheduled for the same day but a later time, it's still future. But the current timestamp is April 17, 4:53 AM UTC, and the game was scheduled for April 16, 10:30 PM ET (which is April 17, 2:30 AM UTC). So the game should have concluded. The search results might not have updated yet. Given that, and the partial scores indicating Oilers were leading, the resolution should be Oilers win (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Oilers, Price: 0.9995, ID: 59816747155426542617753335969320111463521652471998559887509698549179723136462, Winner: No\n- Token: Sharks, Price: 0.0005, ID: 33456658177112736491847061342610859388486070548335287042088235275635071543369, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Sharks, p2 to Oilers, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Sharks, p2 = Oilers\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Oilers outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
