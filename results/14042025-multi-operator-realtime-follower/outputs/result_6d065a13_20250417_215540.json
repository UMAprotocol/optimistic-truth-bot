      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the UEFA Europa League quarter-final between Lazio and Bod\u00f8/Glimt. The ancillary data specifies that if Bod\u00f8/Glimt advances, it's p1; if Lazio advances, p2; and if canceled/postponed beyond December 31, 2025, it's p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The timestamp given is April 17, 2025, 21:53:27 UTC. The second leg is scheduled for April 17, 2025, at 21:00 CET, which is the same day. Since the current time is 9:53 PM UTC, and CET is UTC+1, the match would have started at 20:00 UTC (9 PM CET). So the match is ongoing or just finished. But the user's current timestamp is 9:55 PM UTC, which is 10:55 PM CET. The match would have ended around 11 PM CET, so the result should be available.\n\nLooking at the search results, the first leg was Bod\u00f8/Glimt 2-0 Lazio [1][4][5][9]. The second leg is today. The user provided search results include a Sofascore live update [8] which shows the match is in progress, but the details are incomplete. However, another source [12] mentions that Brunstad Fet scored a penalty for Bod\u00f8/Glimt. Wait, but that might be from a different match or a simulation. The key is to find the final result of the second leg.\n\nSearch result [2] is a preview for the second leg, stating that Bod\u00f8/Glimt leads 2-0 and the match is on April 17. Search result [10] is a prediction from April 17, 2025, mentioning that Bod\u00f8/Glimt won the first leg 2-0 and discussing the second leg. However, there's no explicit mention of the second leg's result in the provided search results. \n\nWait, search result [12] is a live update link, but the snippet says \"Brunstad Fet scores for Bod\u00f8/Glimt from the penalty spot!\" but without the final score. Other sources like [8] (Sofascore) show aggregated scores but the data is fragmented. The ESPN result [9] is from the first leg. \n\nSince the current timestamp is after the match's scheduled time, but the provided search results don't include the second leg's outcome, I need to infer based on the rules. The user instruction says if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nBod\u00f8/Glimt had a 2-0 lead from the first leg. In the second leg, even if Lazio wins 1-0, Bod\u00f8/Glimt would advance on aggregate. However, if Lazio wins by two goals, it goes to extra time or penalties. But without the second leg result, we can't confirm. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since Bod\u00f8/Glimt has a 2-0 lead, and Lazio needs to overcome that, but there's no data on the second leg's result, the safest assumption is that Bod\u00f8/Glimt advances. However, the instructions also say if the event is on the same day but later time, it's future. Wait, the current timestamp is 9:55 PM UTC, which is 10:55 PM CET. The match started at 9 PM CET (8 PM UTC) and would have ended around 11 PM CET (10 PM UTC). Since the current time is 9:55 PM UTC, the match might still be ongoing. But the user's timestamp is 9:55 PM UTC, which is after the match's start but before the end. Wait, the match duration is 90 minutes plus added time. If it started at 8 PM UTC, it would end around 9:45 PM UTC. The current timestamp is 9:55 PM UTC, so the match has concluded. But the search results don't provide the second leg's result. Therefore, according to the rules, if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. Since Bod\u00f8/Glimt leads 2-0, and Lazio needs to win by 3 goals, which is unlikely, the probable outcome is Bod\u00f8/Glimt advances. Hence, recommend p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744926807 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-17 21:53:27 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the UEFA Europa League quarter-final between Lazio and Bod\u00f8/Glimt. The ancillary data specifies that if Bod\u00f8/Glimt advances, it's p1; if Lazio advances, p2; and if canceled/postponed beyond December 31, 2025, it's p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The timestamp given is April 17, 2025, 21:53:27 UTC. The second leg is scheduled for April 17, 2025, at 21:00 CET, which is the same day. Since the current time is 9:53 PM UTC, and CET is UTC+1, the match would have started at 20:00 UTC (9 PM CET). So the match is ongoing or just finished. But the user's current timestamp is 9:55 PM UTC, which is 10:55 PM CET. The match would have ended around 11 PM CET, so the result should be available.\n\nLooking at the search results, the first leg was Bod\u00f8/Glimt 2-0 Lazio [1][4][5][9]. The second leg is today. The user provided search results include a Sofascore live update [8] which shows the match is in progress, but the details are incomplete. However, another source [12] mentions that Brunstad Fet scored a penalty for Bod\u00f8/Glimt. Wait, but that might be from a different match or a simulation. The key is to find the final result of the second leg.\n\nSearch result [2] is a preview for the second leg, stating that Bod\u00f8/Glimt leads 2-0 and the match is on April 17. Search result [10] is a prediction from April 17, 2025, mentioning that Bod\u00f8/Glimt won the first leg 2-0 and discussing the second leg. However, there's no explicit mention of the second leg's result in the provided search results. \n\nWait, search result [12] is a live update link, but the snippet says \"Brunstad Fet scores for Bod\u00f8/Glimt from the penalty spot!\" but without the final score. Other sources like [8] (Sofascore) show aggregated scores but the data is fragmented. The ESPN result [9] is from the first leg. \n\nSince the current timestamp is after the match's scheduled time, but the provided search results don't include the second leg's outcome, I need to infer based on the rules. The user instruction says if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nBod\u00f8/Glimt had a 2-0 lead from the first leg. In the second leg, even if Lazio wins 1-0, Bod\u00f8/Glimt would advance on aggregate. However, if Lazio wins by two goals, it goes to extra time or penalties. But without the second leg result, we can't confirm. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since Bod\u00f8/Glimt has a 2-0 lead, and Lazio needs to overcome that, but there's no data on the second leg's result, the safest assumption is that Bod\u00f8/Glimt advances. However, the instructions also say if the event is on the same day but later time, it's future. Wait, the current timestamp is 9:55 PM UTC, which is 10:55 PM CET. The match started at 9 PM CET (8 PM UTC) and would have ended around 11 PM CET (10 PM UTC). Since the current time is 9:55 PM UTC, the match might still be ongoing. But the user's timestamp is 9:55 PM UTC, which is after the match's start but before the end. Wait, the match duration is 90 minutes plus added time. If it started at 8 PM UTC, it would end around 9:45 PM UTC. The current timestamp is 9:55 PM UTC, so the match has concluded. But the search results don't provide the second leg's result. Therefore, according to the rules, if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. Since Bod\u00f8/Glimt leads 2-0, and Lazio needs to win by 3 goals, which is unlikely, the probable outcome is Bod\u00f8/Glimt advances. Hence, recommend p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Lazio, Price: 0.29, ID: 2233868164359287722545038572611209631510859905351601879042781653022310192324, Winner: No\n- Token: Bod\u00f8/Glimt, Price: 0.71, ID: 13087062508515931073961711434550209843708117688406746054302387539060595833365, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Bod\u00c3\u00b8/Glimt, p2 to Lazio, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Bod\u00c3, p2 = Lazio\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Bod\u00f8/Glimt outcome (0.710 = 71.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.
