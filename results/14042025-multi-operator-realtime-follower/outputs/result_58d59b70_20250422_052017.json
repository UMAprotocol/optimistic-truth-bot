Your task is to analyze the provided query and decide which AI solver is best suited to handle it.\n\nAvailable solvers: perplexity\n\nSolver descriptions:\n- perplexity: Uses the Perplexity AI search engine to find information online to answer general questions. Best for:\n  * Historical data and events\n  * General knowledge questions requiring context\n  * Questions needing interpretation of complex information\n  * Has knowledge cutoff and may not have very recent information\n\n- code_runner: Executes code to fetch real-time data from specific APIs. Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Available Crypto Data Sources:\n    - Binance: Provides cryptocurrency price data for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies\n  * Available Sports Data Sources:\n    - Sports Data IO - MLB (baseball): MLB baseball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NBA (basketball): NBA basketball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NFL (football): NFL football scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NHL (hockey): NHL hockey scores, statistics, and game data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Avalanche vs. Stars, description: In the upcoming NHL game, scheduled for April 21 at 9:30PM ET:\nIf the Colorado Avalanche win, the market will resolve to \"Avalanche\".\nIf the Dallas Stars win, the market will resolve to \"Stars\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Stars, p2 to Avalanche, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Avalanche vs. Stars, description: In the upcoming NHL game, scheduled for April 21 at 9:30PM ET:\nIf the Colorado Avalanche win, the market will resolve to \"Avalanche\".\nIf the Dallas Stars win, the market will resolve to \"Stars\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Stars, p2 to Avalanche, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745298608 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-22 05:10:08 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport logging\n\n# Load environment variables\nload_dotenv()\nNHL_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\")\n\n# Constants\nRESOLUTION_MAP = {\n    \"COL\": \"p2\",  # Colorado Avalanche\n    \"DAL\": \"p1\",  # Dallas Stars\n    \"50-50\": \"p3\",\n    \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\",\n}\n\n# Configure logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n\n# API Endpoints\nPRIMARY_ENDPOINT = \"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nhl\"\nPROXY_ENDPOINT = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\"\n\ndef fetch_game_data(api_key, game_date, team1, team2):\n    url = f\"{PRIMARY_ENDPOINT}/scores/json/GamesByDate/{game_date}?key={api_key}\"\n    proxy_url = f\"{PROXY_ENDPOINT}/scores/json/GamesByDate/{game_date}?key={api_key}\"\n    \n    try:\n        # Try proxy endpoint first\n        response = requests.get(proxy_url, timeout=10)\n        if response.status_code != 200:\n            # Fallback to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n            response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)\n            response.raise_for_status()\n        \n        games = response.json()\n        for game in games:\n            if (game['HomeTeam'] == team1 and game['AwayTeam'] == team2) or (game['HomeTeam'] == team2 and game['AwayTeam'] == team1):\n                return game\n        return None\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        logging.error(f\"Failed to fetch game data: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef resolve_market(game):\n    if not game:\n        return \"p4\"  # No game data found, too early to resolve\n    \n    if game['Status'] == \"Final\":\n        if game['HomeTeamScore'] > game['AwayTeamScore']:\n            winner = game['HomeTeam']\n        else:\n            winner = game['AwayTeam']\n        \n        return RESOLUTION_MAP.get(winner, \"p3\")  # Default to 50-50 if winner not in map\n    elif game['Status'] == \"Canceled\":\n        return \"p3\"  # Game canceled, resolve as 50-50\n    else:\n        return \"p4\"  # Game not final or canceled, too early to resolve\n\ndef main():\n    game_date = \"2025-04-21\"\n    team1 = \"COL\"  # Colorado Avalanche\n    team2 = \"DAL\"  # Dallas Stars\n    \n    if not NHL_API_KEY:\n        logging.error(\"NHL API key is not set.

Recommendation found: p4.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p4\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Avalanche, Price: 0.515, ID: 74197206025267506498721624109999948101714053274845533466924769921928310318940, Winner: No\n- Token: Stars, Price: 0.485, ID: 38421394785792662605103901606726921216439768980727043554408339619120341291876, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Stars, p2 to Avalanche, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Stars, p2 = Avalanche\n\nInterpretation: Market slightly favors Avalanche (maps to p2 in resolution conditions), but not decisively (0.515 vs 0.485)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Avalanche vs. Stars, description: In the upcoming NHL game, scheduled for April 21 at 9:30PM ET:\nIf the Colorado Avalanche win, the market will resolve to \"Avalanche\".\nIf the Dallas Stars win, the market will resolve to \"Stars\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Stars, p2 to Avalanche, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745298608 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-22 05:10:08 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources.

Where p1 corresponds to Stars, p2 to Avalanche, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Stars, p2 = Avalanche\n\nInterpretation: Market slightly favors Avalanche (maps to p2 in resolution conditions), but not decisively (0.515 vs 0.485)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Returning results in a clear format (either JSON or plaintext with a 'recommendation: X' line)\n\nFor NHL hockey data:\n- Use Sports Data IO API with the SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY from environment variables\n- Use python-dotenv to load the API key:\n  ```python\n  from dotenv import load_dotenv\n  import os\n  \n  load_dotenv()\n  api_key = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\")\n  ```\n- Extract team names and dates from the question\n- The team abbreviations for NHL are:\n  * Seattle Kraken = SEA\n  * Vegas Golden Knights = VGK\n  * Toronto Maple Leafs = TOR\n  * Boston Bruins = BOS\n  * And other standard NHL team abbreviations\n- CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: When defining RESOLUTION_MAP, you MUST use team abbreviations (not full names) as keys:\n  ```python\n  # CORRECT - Use team abbreviations as keys\n  RESOLUTION_MAP = {\n      \"VGK\": \"p1\",  # Golden Knights\n      \"SEA\": \"p2\",  # Kraken\n      \"50-50\": \"p3\",\n      \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\",\n  }\n  \n  # WRONG - Do NOT use full team names as keys\n  # RESOLUTION_MAP = {\n  #     \"Golden Knights\": \"p1\",  # Wrong!

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Avalanche vs. Stars, description: In the upcoming NHL game, scheduled for April 21 at 9:30PM ET:\nIf the Colorado Avalanche win, the market will resolve to \"Avalanche\".\nIf the Dallas Stars win, the market will resolve to \"Stars\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Stars, p2 to Avalanche, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745298608 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-22 05:10:08 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please ensure the API data includes the latest game status and scores. Verify the game date and status directly correlate with the event in question. If the game was played and a result is available, adjust the code to correctly interpret and utilize this data for a resolution recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport logging\n\n# Load environment variables\nload_dotenv()\nNHL_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\")\n\n# Constants\nRESOLUTION_MAP = {\n    \"COL\": \"p2\",  # Colorado Avalanche\n    \"DAL\": \"p1\",  # Dallas Stars\n    \"50-50\": \"p3\",\n    \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\",\n}\n\n# Configure logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n\n# API Endpoints\nPRIMARY_ENDPOINT = \"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nhl/scores/json/GamesByDate/\"\nPROXY_ENDPOINT = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/sportsdata-io-nhl-proxy/GamesByDate/\"\n\ndef fetch_game_data(date):\n    headers = {'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': NHL_API_KEY}\n    url = f\"{PROXY_ENDPOINT}{date}\"\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        return response.json()\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException:\n        logging.warning(\"Proxy failed, trying primary endpoint\")\n        url = f\"{PRIMARY_ENDPOINT}{date}\"\n        try:\n            response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, timeout=10)\n            response.raise_for_status()\n            return response.json()\n        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n            logging.error(f\"Failed to fetch data from primary endpoint: {e}\")\n            return None\n\ndef resolve_market(games):\n    for game in games:\n        if game['HomeTeam'] == 'COL' and game['AwayTeam'] == 'DAL' or game['HomeTeam'] == 'DAL' and game['AwayTeam'] == 'COL':\n            if game['Status'] == 'Final':\n                home_score = game['HomeTeamScore']\n                away_score = game['AwayTeamScore']\n                if home_score > away_score:\n                    winner = game['HomeTeam']\n                else:\n                    winner = game['AwayTeam']\n                return f\"recommendation: {RESOLUTION_MAP[winner]}\"\n            elif game['Status'] == 'Canceled':\n                return f\"recommendation: {RESOLUTION_MAP['50-50']}\"\n            elif game['Status'] == 'Postponed':\n                return f\"recommendation: {RESOLUTION_MAP['Too early to resolve']}\"\n    return f\"recommendation: {RESOLUTION_MAP['Too early to resolve']}\"\n\ndef main():\n    game_date = \"2025-04-21\"\n    games = fetch_game_data(game_date)\n    if games:\n        result = resolve_market(games)\n    else:\n        result = f\"recommendation: {RESOLUTION_MAP['Too early to resolve']}\"\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p4\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful. Recommendation found: p4.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p4\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Avalanche, Price: 0.515, ID: 74197206025267506498721624109999948101714053274845533466924769921928310318940, Winner: No\n- Token: Stars, Price: 0.485, ID: 38421394785792662605103901606726921216439768980727043554408339619120341291876, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Stars, p2 to Avalanche, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Stars, p2 = Avalanche\n\nInterpretation: Market slightly favors Avalanche (maps to p2 in resolution conditions), but not decisively (0.515 vs 0.485)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

This is critical for reliability:\n   - Always try the proxy endpoint first\n   - If the proxy fails, fall back to the primary endpoint\n   - Use appropriate timeout values (10 seconds recommended)\n   - Include proper error handling with try/except blocks\n\nThe code should be completely self-contained and runnable with no arguments.\n\n\nHere's a complete code example that shows how to solve this type of problem:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nimport re\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport logging\n\n# Load API key from .env file\nload_dotenv()\nAPI_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\n\n# Check if API key is available\nif not API_KEY:\n    raise ValueError(\n        \"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY not found in environment variables. \"\n        \"Please add it to your .env file.\"\n    )\n\n# Constants - RESOLUTION MAPPING using internal abbreviations\nRESOLUTION_MAP = {\n    \"TOR\": \"p1\",  # Blue Jays (Home team) maps to p1\n    \"BAL\": \"p2\",  # Orioles (Away team) maps to p2\n    \"50-50\": \"p3\",  # Tie or undetermined maps to p3\n    \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\",  # Incomplete data maps to p4\n}\n\n# Sensitive data patterns to mask in logs\nSENSITIVE_PATTERNS = [\n    re.compile(r\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"Authorization\\s*:\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    # Add more patterns as needed\n]\n\nclass SensitiveDataFilter(logging.Filter):\n    def filter(self, record):\n        original_msg = record.getMessage()\n        masked_msg = original_msg\n        for pattern in SENSITIVE_PATTERNS:\n            masked_msg = pattern.sub(\"******\", masked_msg)\n        record.msg = masked_msg\n        return True\n\n# Configure logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nconsole_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\nconsole_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nconsole_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\nconsole_handler.addFilter(SensitiveDataFilter())\n\nlogger.addHandler(console_handler)\n\n\ndef get_team_abbreviation_map():\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches MLB team data and builds a mapping from full team names to API abbreviations.\n    \n    Returns:\n        Dictionary mapping full team names to API abbreviations\n    \"\"\"\n    url = f\"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json/teams?key={API_KEY}\"\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        teams = response.json()\n        # Build mapping from full team name to API abbreviation\n        return {f\"{team['City']} {team['Name']}\": team['Key'] for team in teams}\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Failed to fetch team abbreviations: {e}\")\n        return {}\n\ndef fetch_game_data(date, team1_name, team2_name, team_abbreviation_map=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches game data for the specified date and teams.\n\n    Args:\n        date: Game date in YYYY-MM-DD format\n        team1_name: First team name (full name or abbreviation)\n        team2_name: Second team name (full name or abbreviation)\n        team_abbreviation_map: Optional mapping of team names to abbreviations\n\n    Returns:\n        Game data dictionary or None if not found\n    \"\"\"\n    logger.info(f\"Fetching game data for game between {team1_name} and {team2_name} on {date}\")\n    \n    # If we don't have a team abbreviation map, try to get one\n    if team_abbreviation_map is None:\n        team_abbreviation_map = get_team_abbreviation_map()\n    \n    # Convert team names to abbreviations if needed\n    team1_api = team_abbreviation_map.get(team1_name, team1_name)\n    team2_api = team_abbreviation_map.get(team2_name, team2_name)\n    \n    logger.info(f\"Using team abbreviations: {team1_api} and {team2_api}\")\n\n    # Use the exact format from the API documentation with key as query parameter\n    url = f\"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/stats/json/BoxScoresFinal/{date}?key={API_KEY}\"\n    \n    # Mask API key in logs\n    masked_url = url.replace(API_KEY, \"******\")\n    logger.debug(f\"Using API endpoint: {masked_url}\")\n\n    try:\n        logger.debug(\"Sending API request\")\n        response = requests.get(url)\n\n        if response.status_code == 404:\n            logger.warning(\n                f\"No data found for {date}.

Making the code runnable with no arguments\n5. Handling errors gracefully\n6. Returning results in a clear format (either JSON or plaintext with a 'recommendation: X' line)\n\nFor NHL hockey data:\n- Use Sports Data IO API with the SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY from environment variables\n- Use python-dotenv to load the API key:\n  ```python\n  from dotenv import load_dotenv\n  import os\n  \n  load_dotenv()\n  api_key = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\")\n  ```\n- Extract team names and dates from the question\n- The team abbreviations for NHL are:\n  * Seattle Kraken = SEA\n  * Vegas Golden Knights = VGK\n  * Toronto Maple Leafs = TOR\n  * Boston Bruins = BOS\n  * And other standard NHL team abbreviations\n- CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: When defining RESOLUTION_MAP, you MUST use team abbreviations (not full names) as keys:\n  ```python\n  # CORRECT - Use team abbreviations as keys\n  RESOLUTION_MAP = {\n      \"VGK\": \"p1\",  # Golden Knights\n      \"SEA\": \"p2\",  # Kraken\n      \"50-50\": \"p3\",\n      \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\",\n  }\n  \n  # WRONG - Do NOT use full team names as keys\n  # RESOLUTION_MAP = {\n  #     \"Golden Knights\": \"p1\",  # Wrong!

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Avalanche vs. Stars, description: In the upcoming NHL game, scheduled for April 21 at 9:30PM ET:\nIf the Colorado Avalanche win, the market will resolve to \"Avalanche\".\nIf the Dallas Stars win, the market will resolve to \"Stars\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Stars, p2 to Avalanche, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution.

Where p1 corresponds to Stars, p2 to Avalanche, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Stars, p2 = Avalanche\n\nInterpretation: Market slightly favors Avalanche (maps to p2 in resolution conditions), but not decisively (0.515 vs 0.485)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Colorado Avalanche vs. Dallas Stars game on April 21, 2025, at 9:30 PM ET. The resolution depends on who won the game. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current timestamp is April 22, 2025, 5:10:08 UTC, which is the day after the game was scheduled. So the event date is in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome of the game using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's some conflicting information. Result [1] from ESPN shows the game ended in a 3-3 tie after overtime, with no goals scored in OT. The table indicates the final score as Avalanche 3, Stars 3, with OT summary stating \"No Goals Scored.\" However, results [2], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [13], [14] all mention the Avalanche winning Game 1 with a score of 5-1. But these references are to Game 1, which was on April 19, 2025. The user's query is about the game on April 21, which is Game 2.\n\nWait, the user's query mentions the game scheduled for April 21 at 9:30 PM ET. The ancillary data refers to this as the upcoming game. However, looking at the search results, [1] is the only one that directly references the April 21 game, showing a 3-3 tie after OT. Other results like [3] mention Game 2 on April 21 but list it as DAL leads 1-0, which might be a mistake. However, [15], [16], [17] are from 2024, so they're not relevant here.\n\nThe key here is to determine if the April 21 game (Game 2) was played and its outcome. According to [1], the game on April 21 ended in a 3-3 tie after overtime with no goals in OT. However, NHL playoff games can't end in a tie; they go into multiple overtimes until a goal is scored. But the ESPN result shows the final score as 3-3 with OT, which is confusing. Maybe it's a mistake in the source, or the game was postponed? Wait, the user's query says if the game is postponed, the market remains open. But the current date is April 22, so the game should have happened.\n\nLooking deeper into [1], the detailed play-by-play shows the game went into 1st OT but no goals were scored. However, NHL playoff rules require continuous overtime until a goal is scored. This inconsistency suggests that maybe the ESPN data is incomplete or incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the game was suspended or postponed after OT, but the search results don't mention that. \n\nOther sources like [3] list the Game 2 on April 21 as \"DAL leads 1-0,\" but that might be a typo or incorrect update. The majority of the search results focus on Game 1 (April 19), where the Avalanche won 5-1. For Game 2 on April 21, only [1] provides specific details, indicating a 3-3 tie after OT, which isn't possible in NHL playoffs. This inconsistency is problematic.\n\nGiven the conflicting information, I need to rely on the most direct source. [1] is from ESPN and specifically details the April 21 game, showing a 3-3 tie after OT. However, since NHL playoff games can't end in a tie, this must be an error. Alternatively, maybe the game was decided in a shootout, but shootouts aren't part of NHL playoff rules. Therefore, the game should have continued until a goal was scored. The absence of a result in the ESPN data might indicate that the game was postponed or suspended, but there's no mention of that in the search results.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game did go into multiple overtimes, and the ESPN data only shows the first OT period. However, without further information, it's unclear. The user's ancillary data states that if the game is postponed, the market remains open. If the game was canceled, it resolves 50-50. But according to the current timestamp, the game date has passed, so it should have been completed. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but considering that [1] is the only source directly referencing the April 21 game and shows a 3-3 tie after OT, which is not a valid playoff outcome, it's possible that the game was either ongoing beyond the first OT or there was an error in reporting. However, since the current date is April 22, the game must have concluded. If no conclusive result is found in the sources, and the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, but the ancillary data defines p2 as Avalanche win. \n\nWait, the resolution conditions are p1: Stars, p2: Avalanche, p3: 50-50. The user's query says if the Avalanche win, resolve to p2. If the Stars win, p1. If postponed, remain open. If canceled, p3. \n\nBut according to [1], the game ended 3-3 after OT, which isn't possible. Therefore, this might be a data error. Alternatively, maybe the game was decided in a shootout, but that's not part of playoffs. Therefore, the game should have a winner. Since the search results don't provide a clear winner for the April 21 game, and most sources talk about Game 1, perhaps the April 21 game (Game 2) wasn't played or the data is missing. However, the user provided search results, and [1] is the only one about the April 21 game, which shows a tie, which is invalid. \n\nIn this case, since the event date has passed and there's no verifiable outcome, but the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The ancillary data says if canceled, resolve to p3 (50-50). However, if the game was played but the result is unclear, it's ambiguous. But given that [1] shows the game as 3-3 after OT, which isn't a valid result, it's possible the game was postponed or canceled. However, the market rules say if postponed, it remains open. But the current date is after the event date, so if the game was postponed, the market should remain open, but the user's instruction says to resolve based on the current timestamp. \n\nThis is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the game was played to completion, but the search results are incomplete. Given the conflict, and the lack of clear information, the safest resolution is p3 (50-50) if the game was canceled, but the user's instruction says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable outcome based on the series (Avalanche leading 1-0) might be Avalanche winning, but that's speculative. However, the user's instruction says to resolve based on verifiable facts. Since the only verifiable info is [1] showing a tie, which is invalid, and no other sources, perhaps the game was not completed, leading to p3. \n\nBut the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The conditions in the ancillary data don't specify, but the market resolves to Avalanche if they win, Stars if they win. Since there's no verifiable info, but the game was scheduled and the date has passed, perhaps the game was played, but the result isn't captured correctly. Alternatively, the ESPN data might be incorrect. \n\nGiven the confusion, but following the user's instruction to resolve p4 if the event is in the future, but here it's in the past. The user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable outcome based on Game 1's Avalanche win might be Avalanche winning Game 2, but that's an assumption. However, the user's instruction says to use the provided search results. Since [1] is the only source on the April 21 game and it shows a tie, which is invalid, perhaps the game was canceled or postponed, leading to p3. But the market rules say if postponed, it remains open. However, the current date is after the event, so if postponed, the market remains open, but the resolution can't be p4 because the event date is in the past. \n\nThis is a tricky situation. Given the conflicting data and the instructions, the safest bet is to resolve p3 (50-50) due to the lack of verifiable outcome. However, the user's instruction says if no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without any info, it's unclear. Alternatively, maybe the game was played and the result is in [1], but it's a tie, which isn't possible, so perhaps the game was canceled. Therefore, resolve to p3. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the game went into multiple overtimes and the Avalanche won, but there's no info. Since the user's instruction says to use the provided search results, and [1] is the only one, which shows a tie, but that's invalid, perhaps the game was canceled, leading to p3. \n\nAlternatively, the ESPN data might have a mistake, and the actual result is a Stars win, as per [3] which says DAL leads 1-0, but that's from a different source. Wait, [3] is from Bleacher Report and says in the schedule: \"Game 2: Colorado Avalanche at Dallas Stars, 9:30 p.m. ET (DAL leads 1-0)\". This suggests that DAL won Game 2, making the series 1-0 for DAL. But that conflicts with [1] which shows a 3-3 tie. \n\nThis is conflicting. [3] is from April 22, 2025, and says DAL leads 1-0, implying they won Game 2. However, [1] from ESPN on April 20 (but the game was on April 21) shows a 3-3 tie. This is confusing. Maybe the ESPN data is from a different game? Wait, the URL in [1] is for gameId 401768161, which might be a specific identifier. The date on the ESPN page is April 20, but the game was on April 21. Maybe a typo? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ESPN data is incorrect. Given that [3] states DAL leads 1-0 after Game 2, that would mean DAL won Game 2. Therefore, the resolution should be p1 (Stars). However, [1] shows a tie, which is conflicting. \n\nThis is a major conflict. To resolve this, I need to check other sources. [14] from NHL.com's Avalanche page mentions Game 2 on April 21, but the content is about Game 1. [15], [16], [17] are from 2024, so irrelevant. \n\nGiven that [3] (Bleacher Report) and [1] (ESPN) conflict, but [3] is from April 22 and states DAL leads 1-0, while [1] shows a tie, it's possible that [1] is incorrect or refers to a different game. Since the user's query is about the April 21 game, and [3] mentions DAL leading 1-0 after Game 2, that suggests DAL won. Therefore, the resolution should be p1 (Stars). \n\nHowever, the ESPN data in [1] shows a tie, which is confusing. But considering that NHL playoff games can't end in a tie, and [3] is a more recent source stating DAL leads 1-0, it's more likely that the Stars won Game 2. Therefore, the resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Colorado Avalanche vs. Dallas Stars game on April 21, 2025, at 9:30 PM ET. The resolution depends on who won the game. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current timestamp is April 22, 2025, 5:10:08 UTC, which is the day after the game was scheduled. So the event date is in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome of the game using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's some conflicting information. Result [1] from ESPN shows the game ended in a 3-3 tie after overtime, with no goals scored in OT. The table indicates the final score as Avalanche 3, Stars 3, with OT summary stating \"No Goals Scored.\" However, results [2], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [13], [14] all mention the Avalanche winning Game 1 with a score of 5-1. But these references are to Game 1, which was on April 19, 2025. The user's query is about the game on April 21, which is Game 2.\n\nWait, the user's query mentions the game scheduled for April 21 at 9:30 PM ET. The ancillary data refers to this as the upcoming game. However, looking at the search results, [1] is the only one that directly references the April 21 game, showing a 3-3 tie after OT. Other results like [3] mention Game 2 on April 21 but list it as DAL leads 1-0, which might be a mistake. However, [15], [16], [17] are from 2024, so they're not relevant here.\n\nThe key here is to determine if the April 21 game (Game 2) was played and its outcome. According to [1], the game on April 21 ended in a 3-3 tie after overtime with no goals in OT. However, NHL playoff games can't end in a tie; they go into multiple overtimes until a goal is scored. But the ESPN result shows the final score as 3-3 with OT, which is confusing. Maybe it's a mistake in the source, or the game was postponed? Wait, the user's query says if the game is postponed, the market remains open. But the current date is April 22, so the game should have happened.\n\nLooking deeper into [1], the detailed play-by-play shows the game went into 1st OT but no goals were scored. However, NHL playoff rules require continuous overtime until a goal is scored. This inconsistency suggests that maybe the ESPN data is incomplete or incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the game was suspended or postponed after OT, but the search results don't mention that. \n\nOther sources like [3] list the Game 2 on April 21 as \"DAL leads 1-0,\" but that might be a typo or incorrect update. The majority of the search results focus on Game 1 (April 19), where the Avalanche won 5-1. For Game 2 on April 21, only [1] provides specific details, indicating a 3-3 tie after OT, which isn't possible in NHL playoffs. This inconsistency is problematic.\n\nGiven the conflicting information, I need to rely on the most direct source. [1] is from ESPN and specifically details the April 21 game, showing a 3-3 tie after OT. However, since NHL playoff games can't end in a tie, this must be an error. Alternatively, maybe the game was decided in a shootout, but shootouts aren't part of NHL playoff rules. Therefore, the game should have continued until a goal was scored. The absence of a result in the ESPN data might indicate that the game was postponed or suspended, but there's no mention of that in the search results.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game did go into multiple overtimes, and the ESPN data only shows the first OT period. However, without further information, it's unclear. The user's ancillary data states that if the game is postponed, the market remains open. If the game was canceled, it resolves 50-50. But according to the current timestamp, the game date has passed, so it should have been completed. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but considering that [1] is the only source directly referencing the April 21 game and shows a 3-3 tie after OT, which is not a valid playoff outcome, it's possible that the game was either ongoing beyond the first OT or there was an error in reporting. However, since the current date is April 22, the game must have concluded. If no conclusive result is found in the sources, and the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, but the ancillary data defines p2 as Avalanche win. \n\nWait, the resolution conditions are p1: Stars, p2: Avalanche, p3: 50-50. The user's query says if the Avalanche win, resolve to p2. If the Stars win, p1. If postponed, remain open. If canceled, p3. \n\nBut according to [1], the game ended 3-3 after OT, which isn't possible. Therefore, this might be a data error. Alternatively, maybe the game was decided in a shootout, but that's not part of playoffs. Therefore, the game should have a winner. Since the search results don't provide a clear winner for the April 21 game, and most sources talk about Game 1, perhaps the April 21 game (Game 2) wasn't played or the data is missing. However, the user provided search results, and [1] is the only one about the April 21 game, which shows a tie, which is invalid. \n\nIn this case, since the event date has passed and there's no verifiable outcome, but the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The ancillary data says if canceled, resolve to p3 (50-50). However, if the game was played but the result is unclear, it's ambiguous. But given that [1] shows the game as 3-3 after OT, which isn't a valid result, it's possible the game was postponed or canceled. However, the market rules say if postponed, it remains open. But the current date is after the event date, so if the game was postponed, the market should remain open, but the user's instruction says to resolve based on the current timestamp. \n\nThis is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the game was played to completion, but the search results are incomplete. Given the conflict, and the lack of clear information, the safest resolution is p3 (50-50) if the game was canceled, but the user's instruction says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable outcome based on the series (Avalanche leading 1-0) might be Avalanche winning, but that's speculative. However, the user's instruction says to resolve based on verifiable facts. Since the only verifiable info is [1] showing a tie, which is invalid, and no other sources, perhaps the game was not completed, leading to p3. \n\nBut the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The conditions in the ancillary data don't specify, but the market resolves to Avalanche if they win, Stars if they win. Since there's no verifiable info, but the game was scheduled and the date has passed, perhaps the game was played, but the result isn't captured correctly. Alternatively, the ESPN data might be incorrect. \n\nGiven the confusion, but following the user's instruction to resolve p4 if the event is in the future, but here it's in the past. The user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable outcome based on Game 1's Avalanche win might be Avalanche winning Game 2, but that's an assumption. However, the user's instruction says to use the provided search results. Since [1] is the only source on the April 21 game and it shows a tie, which is invalid, perhaps the game was canceled or postponed, leading to p3. But the market rules say if postponed, it remains open. However, the current date is after the event, so if postponed, the market remains open, but the resolution can't be p4 because the event date is in the past. \n\nThis is a tricky situation. Given the conflicting data and the instructions, the safest bet is to resolve p3 (50-50) due to the lack of verifiable outcome. However, the user's instruction says if no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without any info, it's unclear. Alternatively, maybe the game was played and the result is in [1], but it's a tie, which isn't possible, so perhaps the game was canceled. Therefore, resolve to p3. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the game went into multiple overtimes and the Avalanche won, but there's no info. Since the user's instruction says to use the provided search results, and [1] is the only one, which shows a tie, but that's invalid, perhaps the game was canceled, leading to p3. \n\nAlternatively, the ESPN data might have a mistake, and the actual result is a Stars win, as per [3] which says DAL leads 1-0, but that's from a different source. Wait, [3] is from Bleacher Report and says in the schedule: \"Game 2: Colorado Avalanche at Dallas Stars, 9:30 p.m. ET (DAL leads 1-0)\". This suggests that DAL won Game 2, making the series 1-0 for DAL. But that conflicts with [1] which shows a 3-3 tie. \n\nThis is conflicting. [3] is from April 22, 2025, and says DAL leads 1-0, implying they won Game 2. However, [1] from ESPN on April 20 (but the game was on April 21) shows a 3-3 tie. This is confusing. Maybe the ESPN data is from a different game? Wait, the URL in [1] is for gameId 401768161, which might be a specific identifier. The date on the ESPN page is April 20, but the game was on April 21. Maybe a typo? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ESPN data is incorrect. Given that [3] states DAL leads 1-0 after Game 2, that would mean DAL won Game 2. Therefore, the resolution should be p1 (Stars). However, [1] shows a tie, which is conflicting. \n\nThis is a major conflict. To resolve this, I need to check other sources. [14] from NHL.com's Avalanche page mentions Game 2 on April 21, but the content is about Game 1.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.

The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the outcome of the Avalanche vs. Stars game on April 21, 2025, at 9:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Avalanche win, it's p2; if the Stars win, p1; if postponed, the market stays open; if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is April 22, 2025, so the game in question (April 21) has already occurred. The next step is to verify the game's outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's some conflicting information. Source [1] from ESPN shows the final score as Avalanche 3, Stars 3, going into overtime with no goals scored. However, the same source also mentions \"COL leads series 1-0,\" which might be a mistake because a tied game wouldn't advance the series. \n\nSource [5] (thescore.com) lists the game on April 21 as a 3-3 tie in OT, with the series tied 0-0, which contradicts the series lead mentioned in [1]. But other sources like [3], [4], [6], [7], [8], [12], and [16] all reference Game 1 as a 5-1 Avalanche win on April 19, and Game 2 scheduled for April 21. \n\nWait, there's confusion here. The user's query is about the game on April 21, which should be Game 2. However, some sources like [1] and [5] might be mixing up the dates. Let me cross-reference. \n\nSource [1] (ESPN) has a live score page dated 2025-04-20, which seems to be for Game 1 (April 19), but the table shows a 3-3 OT result. However, other sources like [3], [4], [12] clearly state that Game 1 on April 19 was a 5-1 Avalanche victory. This discrepancy is critical. \n\nLooking deeper, source [1] might have a typo in the date. The URL says 401768161, which could be a game ID, but the content mentions \"Apr 21, 2025\" in the title, but the detailed period scores show a 3-3 tie. However, other sources like [8] (NHL.com) confirm that Game 1 was a 5-1 Avalanche win on April 19, and Game 2 was scheduled for April 21. \n\nSource [5] (thescore.com) lists the April 21 game as a 3-3 OT tie, but this conflicts with [8], which is an official NHL source. Also, source [15] (actionnetwork.com) discusses Game 2 on April 21, predicting Blackwood's saves, implying the game happened. \n\nWait, the user's query is about the April 21 game. The search results have conflicting data: some sources say Game 1 was April 19 (5-1 COL), Game 2 April 21. But ESPN's live score [1] and thescore.com [5] show a 3-3 OT game on April 21. However, the official NHL source [8] states that Game 2 was on April 21, and the Avalanche won Game 1 5-1. \n\nThis inconsistency needs resolution. The key is to determine which sources are reliable. Official team sites and NHL.com are more trustworthy. Source [8] (NHL.com) clearly states the Avalanche won Game 1 5-1. However, for Game 2 on April 21, the ESPN live score [1] and thescore.com [5] show a 3-3 tie, but that's impossible in playoffs, which don't have ties; they go to overtime until a goal is scored. \n\nWait, in the NHL playoffs, games can't end in a tie; they play multiple overtimes until there's a winner. So a 3-3 OT result with no goals (as per [1]) is incorrect. Therefore, the ESPN data might be erroneous. \n\nLooking at source [5] again, it shows the April 21 game as a 3-3 tie, but that's not possible. This suggests a data entry error. Meanwhile, source [7] (coloradohockeynow.com) mentions Game 2 on April 21, with the Avalanche looking to take control after a 5-1 Game 1 win. Source [6] (dallasexpress.com) discusses the Stars seeking a comeback in Game 2 after losing Game 1 5-1. \n\nTherefore, the April 21 game (Game 2) must have occurred, and the correct outcome needs to be determined. However, the search results don't provide a clear result for Game 2. Source [1] and [5] might be referring to a different game or have incorrect data. \n\nGiven the user's instruction to resolve based on verifiable facts and the provided sources, and considering the conflicting data, I need to check all sources again. \n\nSource [1] (ESPN) shows a 3-3 OT game, but the NHL doesn't have ties in playoffs. This could be a regular-season game, but the context is playoffs. Therefore, this might be an error. Other sources like [3], [4], [6], [7], [8], [12] all confirm Game 1 as a 5-1 Avalanche win. For Game 2, the only sources mentioning it are [1], [5], [6], [7], [8], [15], but none provide a clear result. \n\nWait, source [8] (NHL.com) mentions Game 2 on April 21 but doesn't provide the result. The user's current date is April 22, so the game on April 21 should have a result. However, the provided search results don't include a post-April 21 source that confirms the outcome. The latest sources are from April 21, discussing the upcoming Game 2. \n\nThis is a problem. Without a verified source confirming the outcome of the April 21 game, the resolution is unclear. The user's personalization instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nBut the ancillary data says if the game is canceled, resolve to 50-50 (p3). However, the game was scheduled and presumably played. If there's no data, but the event date has passed, and the user provided sources up to April 21, but no post-game reports, it's possible the game was played, but the result isn't in the provided sources. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game went into multiple overtimes and the provided sources don't cover it. However, the user's personalization says to use the provided search results. \n\nGiven the conflicting data in the sources, especially ESPN [1] showing a 3-3 tie (which can't happen in playoffs), and other sources not reporting the Game 2 result, it's challenging. However, the user's instruction says to resolve contradictions between ESPN and Bleacher Report. Wait, Bleacher Report isn't in the provided sources. The user might have intended to refer to the conflicting data between ESPN and other sources. \n\nIn the absence of clear, post-game sources, and considering the user's instruction to resolve based on provided search results, which include ESPN's live score showing a 3-3 OT game but no winner, which is impossible, it's likely an error. The most probable outcome, given the Avalanche's momentum from Game 1, would be an Avalanche win. However, without verified data, the resolution should default to p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nBut the conditions in the ancillary data say if the game is canceled, resolve to p3. If the game was played but no result is available, it's unclear. However, the user's current date is April 22, so the game should have happened. The provided sources don't include post-April 21 reports, so it's possible the data is incomplete. \n\nGiven the confusion and conflicting sources, and following the user's instruction to resolve contradictions between ESPN and other reports, the most reliable sources (NHL.com, team sites) indicate that the Avalanche won Game 1, but there's no clear data on Game 2. However, the query is about the April 21 game (Game 2). Since the provided sources don't confirm the outcome, but the event date has passed, the resolution should be p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nBut the ancillary data specifies that if the game is canceled, it's p3. If the game was played but no result is found, it's not canceled. Therefore, the resolution should be based on the most probable outcome. Given the Avalanche's performance in Game 1 and being favorites, the probable outcome is Avalanche win (p2). However, without verified data, this is speculative. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to use the provided search results. The only mention of the April 21 game's result is in [1] and [5], which show a 3-3 tie, which is impossible. Therefore, these sources might be incorrect. Since the NHL doesn't have ties in playoffs, the game must have had a winner. If the sources are conflicting, but the official NHL source [8] doesn't report the Game 2 result, and the user's provided data doesn't include it, the resolution is unclear. \n\nIn this case, the safest recommendation is p4 (cannot resolve) due to insufficient information. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Given that, and considering the Avalanche's momentum, the recommendation would be p2 (Avalanche). But this is uncertain. \n\nAlternatively, if the game on April 21 was indeed a 3-3 tie that went into multiple overtimes, but the sources don't report the final outcome, it's still unresolved. However, in reality, NHL playoff games can't end in a tie, so there must be a winner. The lack of reporting in the provided sources suggests that the data is incomplete. \n\nGiven the user's instruction to resolve based on provided sources and the contradictions, and considering the ESPN report [1] shows a 3-3 tie but no winner, which is impossible, it's likely an error. Therefore, the most probable outcome based on the Avalanche's previous win and being favorites would be p2. However, without verified data, this is a judgment call. \n\nBut the user's personalization says to resolve based on verifiable facts. Since the provided sources don't confirm the outcome, the correct recommendation is p4. However, the user's instruction also says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThis is a conflict. Given the ambiguity, but following the user's primary instruction to resolve based on verifiable facts, and the lack of clear data, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Where p1 corresponds to Stars, p2 to Avalanche, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Stars, p2 = Avalanche\n\nInterpretation: Market slightly favors Avalanche (maps to p2 in resolution conditions), but not decisively (0.515 vs 0.485)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Avalanche vs. Stars game on April 21, 2025. The key here is to determine who won that game using the provided search results.\n\nFirst, I need to check the date. The current timestamp is April 22, 2025, so the game in question (April 21) has already happened. Now, looking at the search results, there's conflicting information. Some sources like ESPN [1] mention a 3-3 tie with no overtime goals, while others like NHL.com [2][9][10][11] report a 5-1 Avalanche win in Game 1. Wait, but the game in question is Game 2 on April 21. Let me clarify.\n\nLooking at the search results, [1] is from ESPN and shows a game on April 20 with a 3-3 final score. However, the user's query is about the game on April 21. The other sources ([2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]) all discuss Game 1 on April 19 or 20, where the Avalanche won 5-1. But the user is asking about the April 21 game, which is Game 2. \n\nWait, the search results might be conflicting. Let me check each source again. \n\nLooking at [1], the URL says \"Apr 21, 2025\" but the content mentions a 3-3 tie. However, other sources like [9] (NHL.com) clearly state that Game 2 was on April 21, and the Avalanche won 5-1. Wait, no\u2014[9] is about Game 1 on April 19, and Game 2 is scheduled for April 21. But according to [9], the Avalanche won Game 1, and Game 2 is upcoming. However, the current date is April 22, so Game 2 should have happened. \n\nWait, the user's query is about the game scheduled for April 21 at 9:30 PM ET. The current timestamp is April 22, 5:10 AM UTC, which is April 22, 1:10 AM ET. So the game would have occurred on April 21 evening, which is already past. \n\nNow, looking for results about the April 21 game. The search results [1] from ESPN shows a game on April 21 with a 3-3 score, but other sources like [3], [5], [7], [9], [12] discuss Game 2 on April 21. For example, [3] says \"Game 2 goes down on Monday, April 21 at 9:30 p.m. ET.\" [5] talks about Game 2 predictions. [7] mentions the Stars seeking a comeback in Game 2 on April 21. [9] is the Avalanche's Game 2 preview, stating the game is on April 21. [12] also discusses Game 2 on April 21. \n\nHowever, the actual result of Game 2 is conflicting. The ESPN result [1] shows a 3-3 tie, but other sources like [9] (NHL.com) and [10][11] (AP News) only report on Game 1. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check if any sources mention the outcome of Game 2. \n\nLooking at [1], the ESPN page shows a live score for the April 21 game with a 3-3 final score and no overtime goals. However, other sources like [7] (Dallas Express) from April 21 discuss the upcoming Game 2, implying it hasn't happened yet. But given the current date is April 22, the game should have concluded. \n\nWait, perhaps the ESPN result [1] is incorrect or a placeholder. The other sources don't mention the Game 2 result. The NHL.com article [9] is a preview for Game 2, not a recap. Similarly, [12] (Times of India) from April 21 is a preview. The only source that mentions a result for April 21 is [1], but it's unclear if that's accurate. \n\nThe user's ancillary data specifies that if the game is postponed or canceled, resolve accordingly. However, the game was scheduled for April 21 and the current date is April 22, so it should have been played. The conflicting information between ESPN's 3-3 tie and the lack of other reports complicates things. \n\nBut according to the instructions, if no verifiable information is available post-event, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The Avalanche won Game 1 decisively, and in Game 2, they were favored. However, the ESPN report [1] suggests a tie, but that might be an error. Without corroborating sources, it's risky. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says to resolve based on the most probable outcome if no verifiable info is available. Since the only source mentioning the April 21 game is [1] with a 3-3 tie, but that's from ESPN, which might be reliable, but other sources don't mention it. Alternatively, maybe the ESPN result is for a different game or a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the date. The ancillary data mentions the game on April 21, but the search results mostly discuss Game 1 on April 19/20. The ESPN result [1] might be for a different game or a typo. \n\nGiven the confusion, the safest approach is to check if the event date is in the past. Since it's April 22, the game on April 21 has occurred. If the only source is [1] showing a 3-3 tie, but according to NHL rules, regular-season games go to overtime, but playoff games continue until a winner is decided. A 3-3 tie in a playoff game would go to overtime, so the game wouldn't end in a tie. Therefore, the ESPN result might be incorrect or a regular-season game. \n\nWait, the Avalanche and Stars are in the playoffs, so their games can't end in a tie. The ESPN result [1] must be incorrect or from a different context. Therefore, the most probable outcome is that the Avalanche won Game 2, given their momentum from Game 1 and being favored. However, without explicit sources confirming the Game 2 result, the resolution should be p4 (cannot be resolved). But the user's instruction says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the ESPN result [1] is accurate, indicating the game went to overtime but no goals were scored, which is impossible in playoffs. Therefore, the ESPN data might be flawed. \n\nGiven the conflicting information and the need to follow the user's instructions to resolve based on verifiable facts, and considering that the only source mentioning the April 21 game is [1] with a 3-3 tie (which is impossible in playoffs), it's likely an error. Therefore, the game might have been postponed or there's a data error. However, the user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. The Avalanche were favored, so p2 (Avalanche) would be the recommendation. But this is uncertain. \n\nAlternatively, if the game was indeed on April 21 and the result is not verifiable, the resolution would be p4. However, the ESPN result [1] exists, but it's conflicting. The user's instruction says to heavily bias towards URLs provided. The ESPN URL is provided, but it's unclear if it's for the correct game. The title says \"Avalanche vs. Stars (Apr 21, 2025) Live Score - ESPN\" with a 3-3 final, but playoff games can't end in a tie. Therefore, this must be a regular-season game, but the teams are in the playoffs. This is confusing. \n\nWait, the playoff series between Avalanche and Stars started on April 19 (Game 1), with Game 2 on April 21. The ESPN result [1] from April 20 mentions a game on April 21 with a 3-3 score, which might be a mistake. Alternatively, it's a different game. Given the inconsistency, and considering the NHL.com sources [2][9][10][11] all report Game 1 as a 5-1 Avalanche win, and Game 2 was scheduled for April 21, but no post-game reports are in the search results except ESPN's conflicting data, it's possible that the game was not played or the result is not available. \n\nHowever, the user's current date is April 22, so the game should have happened. The lack of other sources except ESPN's conflicting report suggests that the ESPN data might be incorrect. Therefore, following the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, and given the Avalanche's momentum, the recommendation would be p2 (Avalanche). But this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, if the ESPN result is correct and the game ended 3-3, but in playoffs, they play overtime until a goal is scored. Therefore, the game must have a winner. The ESPN result shows no OT goals, which is impossible. Therefore, the ESPN data is likely incorrect or from a different context. \n\nGiven all this confusion and the instructions to resolve based on verifiable facts, and the only verifiable fact is the ESPN report which is conflicting, but considering the NHL playoff structure, the game must have a winner. Therefore, the ESPN data is likely erroneous, and the Avalanche likely won Game 2, leading to p2. However, without clear sources, the safe answer is p4 (cannot be resolved). But the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome if no info is available. \n\nIn conclusion, despite the conflicting data, the recommendation is p2 (Avalanche) based on the most probable outcome, considering their Game 1 victory and being favored in Game 2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Some sources like ESPN [1] mention a 3-3 tie with no overtime goals, while others like NHL.com [2][9][10][11] report a 5-1 Avalanche win in Game 1. Wait, but the game in question is Game 2 on April 21. Let me clarify.\n\nLooking at the search results, [1] is from ESPN and shows a game on April 20 with a 3-3 final score. However, the user's query is about the game on April 21. The other sources ([2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]) all discuss Game 1 on April 19 or 20, where the Avalanche won 5-1. But the user is asking about the April 21 game, which is Game 2. \n\nWait, the search results might be conflicting. Let me check each source again. \n\nLooking at [1], the URL says \"Apr 21, 2025\" but the content mentions a 3-3 tie. However, other sources like [9] (NHL.com) clearly state that Game 2 was on April 21, and the Avalanche won 5-1. Wait, no\u2014[9] is about Game 1 on April 19, and Game 2 is scheduled for April 21. But according to [9], the Avalanche won Game 1, and Game 2 is upcoming. However, the current date is April 22, so Game 2 should have happened. \n\nWait, the user's query is about the game scheduled for April 21 at 9:30 PM ET. The current timestamp is April 22, 5:10 AM UTC, which is April 22, 1:10 AM ET. So the game would have occurred on April 21 evening, which is already past. \n\nNow, looking for results about the April 21 game. The search results [1] from ESPN shows a game on April 21 with a 3-3 score, but other sources like [3], [5], [7], [9], [12] discuss Game 2 on April 21. For example, [3] says \"Game 2 goes down on Monday, April 21 at 9:30 p.m. ET.\" [5] talks about Game 2 predictions. [7] mentions the Stars seeking a comeback in Game 2 on April 21. [9] is the Avalanche's Game 2 preview, stating the game is on April 21. [12] also discusses Game 2 on April 21. \n\nHowever, the actual result of Game 2 is conflicting. The ESPN result [1] shows a 3-3 tie, but other sources like [9] (NHL.com) and [10][11] (AP News) only report on Game 1. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check if any sources mention the outcome of Game 2. \n\nLooking at [1], the ESPN page shows a live score for the April 21 game with a 3-3 final score and no overtime goals. However, other sources like [7] (Dallas Express) from April 21 discuss the upcoming Game 2, implying it hasn't happened yet. But given the current date is April 22, the game should have concluded. \n\nWait, perhaps the ESPN result [1] is incorrect or a placeholder. The other sources don't mention the Game 2 result. The NHL.com article [9] is a preview for Game 2, not a recap. Similarly, [12] (Times of India) from April 21 is a preview. The only source that mentions a result for April 21 is [1], but it's unclear if that's accurate. \n\nThe user's ancillary data specifies that if the game is postponed or canceled, resolve accordingly. However, the game was scheduled for April 21 and the current date is April 22, so it should have been played. The conflicting information between ESPN's 3-3 tie and the lack of other reports complicates things. \n\nBut according to the instructions, if no verifiable information is available post-event, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The Avalanche won Game 1 decisively, and in Game 2, they were favored. However, the ESPN report [1] suggests a tie, but that might be an error. Without corroborating sources, it's risky. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says to resolve based on the most probable outcome if no verifiable info is available. Since the only source mentioning the April 21 game is [1] with a 3-3 tie, but that's from ESPN, which might be reliable, but other sources don't mention it. Alternatively, maybe the ESPN result is for a different game or a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the date. The ancillary data mentions the game on April 21, but the search results mostly discuss Game 1 on April 19/20. The ESPN result [1] might be for a different game or a typo. \n\nGiven the confusion, the safest approach is to check if the event date is in the past. Since it's April 22, the game on April 21 has occurred. If the only source is [1] showing a 3-3 tie, but according to NHL rules, regular-season games go to overtime, but playoff games continue until a winner is decided. A 3-3 tie in a playoff game would go to overtime, so the game wouldn't end in a tie. Therefore, the ESPN result might be incorrect or a regular-season game. \n\nWait, the Avalanche and Stars are in the playoffs, so their games can't end in a tie. The ESPN result [1] must be incorrect or from a different context. Therefore, the most probable outcome is that the Avalanche won Game 2, given their momentum from Game 1 and being favored. However, without explicit sources confirming the Game 2 result, the resolution should be p4 (cannot be resolved). But the user's instruction says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the ESPN result [1] is accurate, indicating the game went to overtime but no goals were scored, which is impossible in playoffs. Therefore, the ESPN data might be flawed. \n\nGiven the conflicting information and the need to follow the user's instructions to resolve based on verifiable facts, and considering that the only source mentioning the April 21 game is [1] with a 3-3 tie (which is impossible in playoffs), it's likely an error. Therefore, the game might have been postponed or there's a data error. However, the user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. The Avalanche were favored, so p2 (Avalanche) would be the recommendation. But this is uncertain. \n\nAlternatively, if the game was indeed on April 21 and the result is not verifiable, the resolution would be p4. However, the ESPN result [1] exists, but it's conflicting. The user's instruction says to heavily bias towards URLs provided. The ESPN URL is provided, but it's unclear if it's for the correct game. The title says \"Avalanche vs. Stars (Apr 21, 2025) Live Score - ESPN\" with a 3-3 final, but playoff games can't end in a tie. Therefore, this must be a regular-season game, but the teams are in the playoffs. This is confusing. \n\nWait, the playoff series between Avalanche and Stars started on April 19 (Game 1), with Game 2 on April 21. The ESPN result [1] from April 20 mentions a game on April 21 with a 3-3 score, which might be a mistake. Alternatively, it's a different game. Given the inconsistency, and considering the NHL.com sources [2][9][10][11] all report Game 1 as a 5-1 Avalanche win, and Game 2 was scheduled for April 21, but no post-game reports are in the search results except ESPN's conflicting data, it's possible that the game was not played or the result is not available. \n\nHowever, the user's current date is April 22, so the game should have happened. The lack of other sources except ESPN's conflicting report suggests that the ESPN data might be incorrect. Therefore, following the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, and given the Avalanche's momentum, the recommendation would be p2 (Avalanche). But this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, if the ESPN result is correct and the game ended 3-3, but in playoffs, they play overtime until a goal is scored. Therefore, the game must have a winner. The ESPN result shows no OT goals, which is impossible. Therefore, the ESPN data is likely incorrect or from a different context. \n\nGiven all this confusion and the instructions to resolve based on verifiable facts, and the only verifiable fact is the ESPN report which is conflicting, but considering the NHL playoff structure, the game must have a winner. Therefore, the ESPN data is likely erroneous, and the Avalanche likely won Game 2, leading to p2. However, without clear sources, the safe answer is p4 (cannot be resolved). But the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome if no info is available. \n\nIn conclusion, despite the conflicting data, the recommendation is p2 (Avalanche) based on the most probable outcome, considering their Game 1 victory and being favored in Game 2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Avalanche, Price: 0.515, ID: 74197206025267506498721624109999948101714053274845533466924769921928310318940, Winner: No\n- Token: Stars, Price: 0.485, ID: 38421394785792662605103901606726921216439768980727043554408339619120341291876, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the outcome of the Avalanche vs. Stars game on April 21, 2025. The key here is to determine the actual result of the game using the provided search results and ancillary data.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp is 2025-04-22 05:10:08 UTC, which is after the scheduled game time of April 21 at 9:30 PM ET. So the event has already occurred, and I need to verify the outcome.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's conflicting information. Source [1] from ESPN shows a live score with the game going into overtime tied 3-3, but the final outcome isn't explicitly stated. However, source [6] (thescore.com) provides a detailed line score indicating the game ended with the Avalanche at 3 and the Stars at 3, but it's noted as \"COL leads series 1-0,\" which might be a carryover from Game 1. Wait, no\u2014Game 1 was a 5-1 Avalanche win, and this Game 2 is tied 3-3 in OT according to [1]. However, the search results don't clearly state the final result of Game 2. \n\nBut wait, source [13] (nbcdfw.com) from 2024 talks about a Stars win in Game 2 of a previous playoff series, which might be a red herring. The user's query is about the 2025 game. \n\nSource [1] includes a line score that shows the game went into OT with no goals scored in OT, but the final score is listed as 3-3. However, NHL playoff games can't end in a tie; they continue until a goal is scored. This discrepancy suggests that the ESPN source might not have been updated with the final OT result. \n\nLooking further, source [6] (thescore.com) for the April 22, 2025 game lists the score as 3-3 with \"COL leads series 1-0,\" which is confusing because if Game 2 ended in a tie, that's not possible. This indicates a possible error in the data presentation. \n\nHowever, source [9] (coloradohockeynow.com) mentions that the Avalanche won Game 1 and are looking to take control in Game 2, but doesn't provide the result. Source [10] (foxsportsradiocharlotte.com) discusses betting trends and injuries but doesn't state the Game 2 outcome. \n\nThe critical point is that in NHL playoffs, games must have a winner. If the game went into overtime and no goals were scored in the OT summary as per [1], that's impossible. Therefore, there must be a missing update in the search results. However, given the provided data, the most recent information from [1] and [6] shows the game as tied 3-3 after OT, which isn't possible. This inconsistency suggests that the available sources don't conclusively confirm the outcome. \n\nAccording to the ancillary data, if no verifiable information is available post-event, we assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The user instructions also mention resolving contradictions between ESPN and Bleacher Report, but Bleacher Report data isn't provided here. \n\nGiven the confusion in the sources and the lack of a clear final result, and following the instruction to assume the most probable outcome if no verifiable info is available, I need to look for any hints. Source [1] mentions \"COL leads series 1-0,\" which would mean they won Game 1. If Game 2 is tied, the series would be 1-1, but that's not the case here. The series lead still being 1-0 suggests that Game 2 might have been postponed or the result isn't updated. However, the current date is after the game, so it should have been played. \n\nGiven the conflicting data and the requirement to resolve based on verifiable facts, and since the sources don't clearly state the Game 2 outcome, the safest recommendation is p4 (cannot resolve at this time). However, the user instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. The Avalanche were favored, but without clear data, it's uncertain. However, the ancillary data defines p2 as Avalanche win. But without confirmation, maybe p3 (50-50) is appropriate. Wait, the resolution conditions are p1: Stars, p2: Avalanche, p3: 50-50. \n\nBut the user's additional instructions say to focus on resolving contradictions between ESPN and other reports. Since ESPN's live score shows the game went to OT but no result, and other sources don't clarify, it's unclear. However, in NHL playoffs, a game can't end in a tie. The absence of a clear result in the sources might mean the game was postponed or data isn't updated. But the current timestamp is after the event, so if it was postponed, it's still future. However, the user's timestamp is 2025-04-22, and the game was scheduled for April 21. If the game was played but the result isn't clear, and the sources are conflicting, the recommendation would be p4. However, the user instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The Avalanche were leading the series and had momentum, but without confirmation, it's risky. \n\nWait, looking back, source [1] shows the game went into OT but no goals, which is impossible. This suggests that the data might be incomplete. Perhaps the game was still in progress when the source was captured. However, the current timestamp is after the game's scheduled end. Therefore, the most probable outcome based on the conditions (if no info) would be to assume the Avalanche won, as they were favored. But this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, since the user provided a URL in the ancillary data (though not in the search results), but the instructions say to heavily bias towards specified URLs. However, the user didn't provide a URL in the query, so that doesn't apply. \n\nGiven the confusion and lack of clear data, the recommendation is p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's additional instruction says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The Avalanche were favored, so p2. But without verification, this is uncertain. However, the ESPN source [1] shows the game as 3-3 after OT, which is impossible, indicating a data error. Therefore, the safest bet is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745298608 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-22 05:10:08 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please re-evaluate the available sources to provide a clear and definitive outcome based on verifiable facts.

The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the outcome of the Avalanche vs. Stars game on April 21, 2025. The key here is to determine the actual result of the game using the provided search results and ancillary data.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp is 2025-04-22 05:10:08 UTC, which is after the scheduled game time of April 21 at 9:30 PM ET. So the event has already occurred, and I need to verify the outcome.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's conflicting information. Source [1] from ESPN shows a live score with the game going into overtime tied 3-3, but the final outcome isn't explicitly stated. However, source [6] (thescore.com) provides a detailed line score indicating the game ended with the Avalanche at 3 and the Stars at 3, but it's noted as \"COL leads series 1-0,\" which might be a carryover from Game 1. Wait, no\u2014Game 1 was a 5-1 Avalanche win, and this Game 2 is tied 3-3 in OT according to [1]. However, the search results don't clearly state the final result of Game 2. \n\nBut wait, source [13] (nbcdfw.com) from 2024 talks about a Stars win in Game 2 of a previous playoff series, which might be a red herring. The user's query is about the 2025 game. \n\nSource [1] includes a line score that shows the game went into OT with no goals scored in OT, but the final score is listed as 3-3. However, NHL playoff games can't end in a tie; they continue until a goal is scored. This discrepancy suggests that the ESPN source might not have been updated with the final OT result. \n\nLooking further, source [6] (thescore.com) for the April 22, 2025 game lists the score as 3-3 with \"COL leads series 1-0,\" which is confusing because if Game 2 ended in a tie, that's not possible. This indicates a possible error in the data presentation. \n\nHowever, source [9] (coloradohockeynow.com) mentions that the Avalanche won Game 1 and are looking to take control in Game 2, but doesn't provide the result. Source [10] (foxsportsradiocharlotte.com) discusses betting trends and injuries but doesn't state the Game 2 outcome. \n\nThe critical point is that in NHL playoffs, games must have a winner. If the game went into overtime and no goals were scored in the OT summary as per [1], that's impossible. Therefore, there must be a missing update in the search results. However, given the provided data, the most recent information from [1] and [6] shows the game as tied 3-3 after OT, which isn't possible. This inconsistency suggests that the available sources don't conclusively confirm the outcome. \n\nAccording to the ancillary data, if no verifiable information is available post-event, we assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The user instructions also mention resolving contradictions between ESPN and Bleacher Report, but Bleacher Report data isn't provided here. \n\nGiven the confusion in the sources and the lack of a clear final result, and following the instruction to assume the most probable outcome if no verifiable info is available, I need to look for any hints. Source [1] mentions \"COL leads series 1-0,\" which would mean they won Game 1. If Game 2 is tied, the series would be 1-1, but that's not the case here. The series lead still being 1-0 suggests that Game 2 might have been postponed or the result isn't updated. However, the current date is after the game, so it should have been played. \n\nGiven the conflicting data and the requirement to resolve based on verifiable facts, and since the sources don't clearly state the Game 2 outcome, the safest recommendation is p4 (cannot resolve at this time). However, the user instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. The Avalanche were favored, but without clear data, it's uncertain. However, the ancillary data defines p2 as Avalanche win. But without confirmation, maybe p3 (50-50) is appropriate. Wait, the resolution conditions are p1: Stars, p2: Avalanche, p3: 50-50. \n\nBut the user's additional instructions say to focus on resolving contradictions between ESPN and other reports. Since ESPN's live score shows the game went to OT but no result, and other sources don't clarify, it's unclear. However, in NHL playoffs, a game can't end in a tie. The absence of a clear result in the sources might mean the game was postponed or data isn't updated. But the current timestamp is after the event, so if it was postponed, it's still future. However, the user's timestamp is 2025-04-22, and the game was scheduled for April 21. If the game was played but the result isn't clear, and the sources are conflicting, the recommendation would be p4. However, the user instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The Avalanche were leading the series and had momentum, but without confirmation, it's risky. \n\nWait, looking back, source [1] shows the game went into OT but no goals, which is impossible. This suggests that the data might be incomplete. Perhaps the game was still in progress when the source was captured. However, the current timestamp is after the game's scheduled end. Therefore, the most probable outcome based on the conditions (if no info) would be to assume the Avalanche won, as they were favored. But this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, since the user provided a URL in the ancillary data (though not in the search results), but the instructions say to heavily bias towards specified URLs. However, the user didn't provide a URL in the query, so that doesn't apply. \n\nGiven the confusion and lack of clear data, the recommendation is p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's additional instruction says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The Avalanche were favored, so p2. But without verification, this is uncertain. However, the ESPN source [1] shows the game as 3-3 after OT, which is impossible, indicating a data error. Therefore, the safest bet is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Avalanche, Price: 0.515, ID: 74197206025267506498721624109999948101714053274845533466924769921928310318940, Winner: No\n- Token: Stars, Price: 0.485, ID: 38421394785792662605103901606726921216439768980727043554408339619120341291876, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Stars, p2 to Avalanche, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Stars, p2 = Avalanche\n\nInterpretation: Market slightly favors Avalanche (maps to p2 in resolution conditions), but not decisively (0.515 vs 0.485)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Available Crypto Data Sources:\n    - Binance: Provides cryptocurrency price data for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies\n  * Available Sports Data Sources:\n    - Sports Data IO - MLB (baseball): MLB baseball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NBA (basketball): NBA basketball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NFL (football): NFL football scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NHL (hockey): NHL hockey scores, statistics, and game data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Avalanche vs. Stars, description: In the upcoming NHL game, scheduled for April 21 at 9:30PM ET:\nIf the Colorado Avalanche win, the market will resolve to \"Avalanche\".\nIf the Dallas Stars win, the market will resolve to \"Stars\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Stars, p2 to Avalanche, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745298608 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-22 05:10:08 UTC",
