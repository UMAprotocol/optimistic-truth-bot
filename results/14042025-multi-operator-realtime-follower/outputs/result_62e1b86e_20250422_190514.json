      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"Million,\" \"Billion,\" or \"Trillion\" 10 or more times during her next White House press briefing. The resolution depends on the actual count of those terms in the briefing. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp is April 22, 2025, 6:58 PM UTC. The next press briefing is scheduled for April 22 at 1:00 PM ET, which is 5:00 PM UTC. Wait, but the current time is already past that. The user's current time is 6:59 PM UTC on April 22, so the briefing mentioned in search result [8] from YouTube, which was scheduled for 1:00 PM ET on April 22, should have already occurred. However, the search results don't include a transcript of that specific briefing yet. The latest available transcripts are up to April 1, 2025.\n\nSince the user is asking about the next briefing, which is today, but there's no transcript available yet, I need to rely on past behavior. Looking at previous briefings, Leavitt frequently discusses economic policies, tariffs, investments, and government spending, which often involve large numbers. For example, in the March 11 briefing [6], she mentioned \"trillions of dollars of investments\" and \"180 billion.\" On April 1 [16], she discussed tariffs and economic figures, using \"trillion\" and \"billion.\" \n\nIn the March 17 briefing [3], she talked about economic transitions and mentioned specific percentages and figures, though not the exact terms. However, in the February 25 briefing [7], she mentioned \"$500 billion\" and \"20,000 new workers,\" showing a pattern of using \"billion.\" The April 1 briefing [10] also had mentions of \"trillion\" in the context of investments. \n\nConsidering her role as press secretary, economic topics are a staple, and given the administration's focus on tariffs, tax cuts, and energy policies, it's likely she'll reference large figures. Past briefings show she uses \"billion\" and \"trillion\" multiple times. For instance, in the April 1 transcript [16], she used \"trillion\" at least once and \"billion\" a few times. However, reaching 10+ instances would require consistent usage. \n\nWithout the actual transcript of today's briefing, I have to infer based on historical data. If the briefing followed the usual pattern, she might have used the terms several times, but hitting 10 is uncertain. However, given the emphasis on economic achievements and investments in recent briefings, there's a reasonable chance she exceeded 10 mentions. But since the exact count isn't available yet, and the user's timestamp is after the briefing, the resolution would depend on verifying the video. Since the user's current time is after the briefing but no transcript is provided, and the market resolution is based on the video evidence, if the briefing occurred and she used the terms 10+ times, it's \"Yes.\" If not, \"No.\" However, without the transcript, it's safer to check if the briefing happened.

The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"Million,\" \"Billion,\" or \"Trillion\" 10 or more times during her next White House press briefing. The resolution depends on the actual count of those terms in the briefing. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp is April 22, 2025, 6:58 PM UTC. The next press briefing is scheduled for April 22 at 1:00 PM ET, which is 5:00 PM UTC. Wait, but the current time is already past that. The user's current time is 6:59 PM UTC on April 22, so the briefing mentioned in search result [8] from YouTube, which was scheduled for 1:00 PM ET on April 22, should have already occurred. However, the search results don't include a transcript of that specific briefing yet. The latest available transcripts are up to April 1, 2025.\n\nSince the user is asking about the next briefing, which is today, but there's no transcript available yet, I need to rely on past behavior. Looking at previous briefings, Leavitt frequently discusses economic policies, tariffs, investments, and government spending, which often involve large numbers. For example, in the March 11 briefing [6], she mentioned \"trillions of dollars of investments\" and \"180 billion.\" On April 1 [16], she discussed tariffs and economic figures, using \"trillion\" and \"billion.\" \n\nIn the March 17 briefing [3], she talked about economic transitions and mentioned specific percentages and figures, though not the exact terms. However, in the February 25 briefing [7], she mentioned \"$500 billion\" and \"20,000 new workers,\" showing a pattern of using \"billion.\" The April 1 briefing [10] also had mentions of \"trillion\" in the context of investments. \n\nConsidering her role as press secretary, economic topics are a staple, and given the administration's focus on tariffs, tax cuts, and energy policies, it's likely she'll reference large figures. Past briefings show she uses \"billion\" and \"trillion\" multiple times. For instance, in the April 1 transcript [16], she used \"trillion\" at least once and \"billion\" a few times. However, reaching 10+ instances would require consistent usage. \n\nWithout the actual transcript of today's briefing, I have to infer based on historical data. If the briefing followed the usual pattern, she might have used the terms several times, but hitting 10 is uncertain. However, given the emphasis on economic achievements and investments in recent briefings, there's a reasonable chance she exceeded 10 mentions. But since the exact count isn't available yet, and the user's timestamp is after the briefing, the resolution would depend on verifying the video. Since the user's current time is after the briefing but no transcript is provided, and the market resolution is based on the video evidence, if the briefing occurred and she used the terms 10+ times, it's \"Yes.\" If not, \"No.\" However, without the transcript, it's safer to check if the briefing happened. The search result [8] confirms the briefing was scheduled, but there's no indication it was canceled. Assuming it proceeded, and given her past frequency, it's possible she met the threshold. But without concrete evidence, the recommendation would be p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's personalization instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. Given her history, it's probable she used the terms enough times. Therefore, recommend p2 (Yes).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.9655, ID: 103237391174457113486980473819968500484186660344007160316866577206570335260668, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.0345, ID: 99234786528653331258659076148370310031416626697607697029630013983430315138602, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"Million,\" \"Billion,\" or \"Trillion\" at least 10 times during her next White House press briefing. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if she does, \"No\" (p1) if not. The current date is April 22, 2025, and there's a press briefing scheduled for today, April 22, 2025, at 1 PM ET. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already happened. The search results include several YouTube links from April 22, 2025, indicating that the briefing has taken place. For example, result [8] is a CNBC video titled \"White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt holds a briefing with reporters \u2014 4/22/2025.\" Similarly, results [9], [10], [11], [12], [14], and [15] all reference the April 22 briefing. Since the current timestamp is April 22, 2025, 7:02 PM UTC (which is 3:02 PM ET), the briefing at 1 PM ET would have already occurred.\n\nNext, I need to determine if Leavitt used the terms \"Million,\" \"Billion,\" or \"Trillion\" 10+ times during this briefing. The search results provided include transcripts and mentions of her past briefings. For instance, in result [3], from April 3, 2025, she mentions \"trillion\" in the context of a trade deficit. In result [4], from April 1, 2025, she discusses \"billions of dollars in private investments.\" Result [5] from March 11, 2025, includes mentions of \"trillion\" in investments. Result [7] from February 20, 2025, mentions \"trillion dollars over 10 years.\" Result [16] from April 3, 2025, again references a \"$1.2 trillion trade deficit.\" Result [17] from April 8, 2025, mentions \"trillions of dollars in revenue.\" Result [18] from March 18, 2025, discusses her use of the term \"tariffs\" and fact-checking related to economic claims, though not directly the terms in question.\n\nHowever, none of the provided search results include the transcript for the April 22 briefing. The YouTube links (results [8]-[15]) are videos of the briefing, but the transcripts aren't available in the provided data. Without access to the actual video or transcript, I can't count the exact number of times she used the terms. The user specified that the resolution source is the video of the briefing, which isn't accessible here. \n\nGiven the ancillary data, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable information is available, we should assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. Leavitt's past behavior shows frequent use of these terms, especially in economic contexts (e.g., discussing tariffs, investments, deficits). For example, in previous briefings, she's used \"trillion\" multiple times. If today's briefing followed similar themes, it's plausible she reached the 10+ threshold. However, without concrete evidence, there's uncertainty. \n\nThe user's previous response was p2 (Yes), but they asked to check alternative sources. Since the search results don't include the April 22 transcript, and considering the lack of direct evidence, the safest recommendation is p4 (Cannot resolve at this time). However, the user's instruction says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. Given her history, it's likely she met the threshold. But since the exact count isn't verified, maybe p3 (50-50)? Wait, the resolution conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 0.5. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since the event happened today and we can't verify, but her past behavior suggests high usage, maybe p2 is still correct. However, the user's previous p2 was rejected, so perhaps the actual count was under 10. Alternatively, maybe the terms weren't used enough. Without the transcript, it's a guess. But the instructions say if no verifiable info, assume most probable. Given her frequent use in past briefings, it's probable she said them 10+ times. So, despite lack of direct evidence, recommend p2 again, but the user wants a different approach. Alternatively, check if any sources mention the terms in today's briefing. The search results for April 22 don't have transcripts, but the video titles don't indicate any mention. Since the user's previous p2 was rejected, maybe the correct answer is p1. But without data, it's unclear. The safe recommendation is p4, but the instructions say if the event date is past and no info, assume most probable. Given her history, p2 is likely. But the user wants a different approach. Maybe check if she's still press secretary. Result [19] says she became press secretary on Jan 20, 2025, and there's no info she ceased, so the market isn't resolved to No for that. The event happened, so it's not resolved to No. Therefore, based on probable usage, recommend p2 again.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The search results provided include transcripts and mentions of her past briefings. For instance, in result [3], from April 3, 2025, she mentions \"trillion\" in the context of a trade deficit. In result [4], from April 1, 2025, she discusses \"billions of dollars in private investments.\" Result [5] from March 11, 2025, includes mentions of \"trillion\" in investments. Result [7] from February 20, 2025, mentions \"trillion dollars over 10 years.\" Result [16] from April 3, 2025, again references a \"$1.2 trillion trade deficit.\" Result [17] from April 8, 2025, mentions \"trillions of dollars in revenue.\" Result [18] from March 18, 2025, discusses her use of the term \"tariffs\" and fact-checking related to economic claims, though not directly the terms in question.\n\nHowever, none of the provided search results include the transcript for the April 22 briefing. The YouTube links (results [8]-[15]) are videos of the briefing, but the transcripts aren't available in the provided data. Without access to the actual video or transcript, I can't count the exact number of times she used the terms. The user specified that the resolution source is the video of the briefing, which isn't accessible here. \n\nGiven the ancillary data, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable information is available, we should assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. Leavitt's past behavior shows frequent use of these terms, especially in economic contexts (e.g., discussing tariffs, investments, deficits). For example, in previous briefings, she's used \"trillion\" multiple times. If today's briefing followed similar themes, it's plausible she reached the 10+ threshold. However, without concrete evidence, there's uncertainty. \n\nThe user's previous response was p2 (Yes), but they asked to check alternative sources. Since the search results don't include the April 22 transcript, and considering the lack of direct evidence, the safest recommendation is p4 (Cannot resolve at this time). However, the user's instruction says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. Given her history, it's likely she met the threshold. But since the exact count isn't verified, maybe p3 (50-50)? Wait, the resolution conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 0.5. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since the event happened today and we can't verify, but her past behavior suggests high usage, maybe p2 is still correct. However, the user's previous p2 was rejected, so perhaps the actual count was under 10. Alternatively, maybe the terms weren't used enough. Without the transcript, it's a guess. But the instructions say if no verifiable info, assume most probable. Given her frequent use in past briefings, it's probable she said them 10+ times. So, despite lack of direct evidence, recommend p2 again, but the user wants a different approach. Alternatively, check if any sources mention the terms in today's briefing. The search results for April 22 don't have transcripts, but the video titles don't indicate any mention. Since the user's previous p2 was rejected, maybe the correct answer is p1. But without data, it's unclear. The safe recommendation is p4, but the instructions say if the event date is past and no info, assume most probable. Given her history, p2 is likely. But the user wants a different approach. Maybe check if she's still press secretary. Result [19] says she became press secretary on Jan 20, 2025, and there's no info she ceased, so the market isn't resolved to No for that. The event happened, so it's not resolved to No. Therefore, based on probable usage, recommend p2 again.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.9655, ID: 103237391174457113486980473819968500484186660344007160316866577206570335260668, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.0345, ID: 99234786528653331258659076148370310031416626697607697029630013983430315138602, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.966 = 96.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

Hence, p4 is appropriate.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.9655, ID: 103237391174457113486980473819968500484186660344007160316866577206570335260668, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.0345, ID: 99234786528653331258659076148370310031416626697607697029630013983430315138602, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.966 = 96.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
