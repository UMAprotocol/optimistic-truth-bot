      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"Fentanyl\" during her next White House press briefing. The resolution conditions are p2 for Yes, p1 for No, and p3 for uncertain. The current date is April 16, 2025, and the next briefing is likely soon, maybe even today.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a scheduled press briefing after the current timestamp. The search results mention a briefing on April 15, 2025, which is the day before the current date. The user's current time is April 16, 6:51 PM UTC. If the next briefing is on April 16, it would have already happened, but the search results don't show any transcripts or videos from April 16 yet. However, there are multiple YouTube links scheduled for April 15, which might be the most recent ones available.\n\nLooking at the provided search results, especially the transcripts from previous briefings, Leavitt frequently discusses fentanyl in the context of tariffs and border security. For example, in the March 5 briefing [1][4], she mentioned fentanyl multiple times when defending tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Similarly, on January 31 [14][15][16][17], she tied fentanyl to the implementation of tariffs. Her pattern shows that fentanyl is a common topic in her briefings, especially when discussing border security and trade policies.\n\nThe user's query specifies that any usage of \"Fentanyl\" in any form (including plural or possessive) counts. Given Leavitt's history, it's highly probable she'll mention it again, especially if the briefing covers tariffs, border issues, or drug policy. However, if the next briefing focuses on other topics like the economy or foreign policy without touching on drugs, she might not mention it.\n\nBut considering the recent briefings on April 15 [2][8][9][11][12], the topics included tariffs and the economy. Since tariffs are directly linked to fentanyl in her previous explanations, there's a strong chance she'll bring it up again. Additionally, the March 26 briefing [5] also involved discussions where fentanyl could be relevant, though the transcript provided doesn't show it. However, the pattern is consistent enough to assume that fentanyl remains a key point in her rhetoric.\n\nMoreover, the ancillary data states that if Leavitt ceases to be press secretary before the end of 2025, the market resolves to No. There's no indication in the search results that she has left her position; in fact, the April 15 briefings are still listed with her as the speaker.\n\nGiven all this, the most probable outcome is that she will mention \"Fentanyl\" in the next briefing, especially if it's scheduled soon after April 15. However, without explicit confirmation from the April 16 briefing (which might not be available yet), there's a slight uncertainty. But based on historical data and her consistent focus on the topic, the recommendation leans towards Yes.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"Fentanyl\" during her next White House press briefing. The resolution conditions are p2 for Yes, p1 for No, and p3 for uncertain. The current date is April 16, 2025, and the next briefing is likely soon, maybe even today.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a scheduled press briefing after the current timestamp. The search results mention a briefing on April 15, 2025, which is the day before the current date. The user's current time is April 16, 6:51 PM UTC. If the next briefing is on April 16, it would have already happened, but the search results don't show any transcripts or videos from April 16 yet. However, there are multiple YouTube links scheduled for April 15, which might be the most recent ones available.\n\nLooking at the provided search results, especially the transcripts from previous briefings, Leavitt frequently discusses fentanyl in the context of tariffs and border security. For example, in the March 5 briefing [1][4], she mentioned fentanyl multiple times when defending tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Similarly, on January 31 [14][15][16][17], she tied fentanyl to the implementation of tariffs. Her pattern shows that fentanyl is a common topic in her briefings, especially when discussing border security and trade policies.\n\nThe user's query specifies that any usage of \"Fentanyl\" in any form (including plural or possessive) counts. Given Leavitt's history, it's highly probable she'll mention it again, especially if the briefing covers tariffs, border issues, or drug policy. However, if the next briefing focuses on other topics like the economy or foreign policy without touching on drugs, she might not mention it.\n\nBut considering the recent briefings on April 15 [2][8][9][11][12], the topics included tariffs and the economy. Since tariffs are directly linked to fentanyl in her previous explanations, there's a strong chance she'll bring it up again. Additionally, the March 26 briefing [5] also involved discussions where fentanyl could be relevant, though the transcript provided doesn't show it. However, the pattern is consistent enough to assume that fentanyl remains a key point in her rhetoric.\n\nMoreover, the ancillary data states that if Leavitt ceases to be press secretary before the end of 2025, the market resolves to No. There's no indication in the search results that she has left her position; in fact, the April 15 briefings are still listed with her as the speaker.\n\nGiven all this, the most probable outcome is that she will mention \"Fentanyl\" in the next briefing, especially if it's scheduled soon after April 15. However, without explicit confirmation from the April 16 briefing (which might not be available yet), there's a slight uncertainty. But based on historical data and her consistent focus on the topic, the recommendation leans towards Yes.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.485, ID: 93178023182441177448296368144493873859872400392155282458105980465406899302479, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.515, ID: 25715461830361504776455442250334088944131371699086399665709259654903777356427, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market is relatively uncertain (YES: 0.485, NO: 0.515)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The current date is April 16, 2025, and the next briefing after this date is what we need to check. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm when the next briefing is. Looking at the search results, there's a mention of a briefing on April 15, 2025, and another upcoming event on April 16, 2025, at 6:00 pm ET, which is an Easter Prayer Service. The user specified that briefings are typically between 12 PM and 3 PM ET on weekdays. Since April 16 is a Wednesday, but the next event is in the evening, it's possible there was no briefing scheduled for the afternoon of April 16. \n\nNext, I check the latest briefings. Search result [13] mentions a briefing on April 15, 2025, where Leavitt discussed various topics but there's no mention of Fentanyl in the transcript snippet provided. However, in previous briefings, like on March 5, 2025 (search result [4] and [12]), she did mention Fentanyl multiple times in the context of tariffs and border security. \n\nThe user's additional instruction emphasizes that evidence must come from the specific briefing scheduled after April 16, 2025. Since the current date is April 16, 2025, and the next briefing hasn't occurred yet, there's no available data. The latest available briefing is from April 15, which doesn't include Fentanyl mentions based on the provided transcripts. \n\nHowever, the user's query is about the \"next\" briefing after April 16. Since that hasn't happened yet, and the resolution conditions state that if no briefing happens by December 31, 2025, it resolves to \"No\". But the user's personalization instructs to avoid speculation and rely on concrete evidence. Since the next briefing after April 16 hasn't taken place, there's no verifiable information. \n\nWait, the current timestamp is April 16, 2025, 6:49 PM UTC. The next briefing would be on the next weekday, which is April 17. However, the search results don't mention any briefings after April 15. The user's query specifies that if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, resolve to p4. But the market's resolution conditions say to resolve to \"No\" if no briefing happens by December 31. However, the user's personalization says if the event is scheduled for a future date, return p4. \n\nBut the query is about whether she says \"Fentanyl\" in the next briefing she participates in. Since the next briefing hasn't occurred yet, and the current date is April 16, the event is in the future. Therefore, per the instructions, we should return p4. However, the market's own resolution conditions say if no briefing happens by December 31, resolve to \"No\". But the user's personalization takes precedence, instructing to return p4 if the event is in the future. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" The current timestamp is April 16, 2025, 6:49 PM UTC. The next briefing would typically be the next weekday, which is April 17. Since the query is about the \"next\" briefing after April 16, which is in the future, we should return p4. However, the market's resolution conditions have a deadline of December 31, 2025. But the user's instruction says to follow the personalization, which takes precedence. \n\nBut wait, the user's query is asking about the next briefing she participates in. If there's no briefing scheduled yet, but the market allows until December 31, but the event (the next briefing) is in the future, then per the personalization, we should return p4. However, the market's own rules say if no briefing happens by December 31, resolve to \"No\". But the user's personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. \n\nThis is conflicting. The user's personalization says to follow the instructions in <personalization>, which include returning p4 for future events. However, the market's resolution conditions have a deadline. But since the event (the next briefing) is in the future, and we don't have information on whether it will occur, per the user's instruction, we should return p4. \n\nBut looking at the search results, there's a briefing on April 15, 2025 (search result [13]), and the next one would be after April 16. Since the current date is April 16, and the next briefing hasn't happened, the event is in the future. Therefore, per the user's personalization, the recommendation is p4. \n\nHowever, the user's query might be considering the briefing on April 16 itself. The search result [9] mentions an upcoming event at 6:00 pm ET on April 16, which is a prayer service, not a press briefing. The latest briefing mentioned is on April 15. Therefore, the next briefing after April 16 would be on a subsequent date, which is in the future. Hence, p4 is the correct recommendation.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"Fentanyl\" during her next White House press briefing. The current date is April 16, 2025, and the next briefing after this date is what we need to check. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm when the next briefing is. Looking at the search results, there's a mention of a briefing on April 15, 2025, and another upcoming event on April 16, 2025, at 6:00 pm ET, which is an Easter Prayer Service. The user specified that briefings are typically between 12 PM and 3 PM ET on weekdays. Since April 16 is a Wednesday, but the next event is in the evening, it's possible there was no briefing scheduled for the afternoon of April 16. \n\nNext, I check the latest briefings. Search result [13] mentions a briefing on April 15, 2025, where Leavitt discussed various topics but there's no mention of Fentanyl in the transcript snippet provided. However, in previous briefings, like on March 5, 2025 (search result [4] and [12]), she did mention Fentanyl multiple times in the context of tariffs and border security. \n\nThe user's additional instruction emphasizes that evidence must come from the specific briefing scheduled after April 16, 2025. Since the current date is April 16, 2025, and the next briefing hasn't occurred yet, there's no available data. The latest available briefing is from April 15, which doesn't include Fentanyl mentions based on the provided transcripts. \n\nHowever, the user's query is about the \"next\" briefing after April 16. Since that hasn't happened yet, and the resolution conditions state that if no briefing happens by December 31, 2025, it resolves to \"No\". But the user's personalization instructs to avoid speculation and rely on concrete evidence. Since the next briefing after April 16 hasn't taken place, there's no verifiable information. \n\nWait, the current timestamp is April 16, 2025, 6:49 PM UTC. The next briefing would be on the next weekday, which is April 17. However, the search results don't mention any briefings after April 15. The user's query specifies that if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, resolve to p4. But the market's resolution conditions say to resolve to \"No\" if no briefing happens by December 31. However, the user's personalization says if the event is scheduled for a future date, return p4. \n\nBut the query is about whether she says \"Fentanyl\" in the next briefing she participates in. Since the next briefing hasn't occurred yet, and the current date is April 16, the event is in the future. Therefore, per the instructions, we should return p4. However, the market's own resolution conditions say if no briefing happens by December 31, resolve to \"No\". But the user's personalization takes precedence, instructing to return p4 if the event is in the future. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" The current timestamp is April 16, 2025, 6:49 PM UTC. The next briefing would typically be the next weekday, which is April 17. Since the query is about the \"next\" briefing after April 16, which is in the future, we should return p4. However, the market's resolution conditions have a deadline of December 31, 2025. But the user's instruction says to follow the personalization, which takes precedence. \n\nBut wait, the user's query is asking about the next briefing she participates in. If there's no briefing scheduled yet, but the market allows until December 31, but the event (the next briefing) is in the future, then per the personalization, we should return p4. However, the market's own rules say if no briefing happens by December 31, resolve to \"No\". But the user's personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. \n\nThis is conflicting. The user's personalization says to follow the instructions in <personalization>, which include returning p4 for future events. However, the market's resolution conditions have a deadline. But since the event (the next briefing) is in the future, and we don't have information on whether it will occur, per the user's instruction, we should return p4. \n\nBut looking at the search results, there's a briefing on April 15, 2025 (search result [13]), and the next one would be after April 16. Since the current date is April 16, and the next briefing hasn't happened, the event is in the future. Therefore, per the user's personalization, the recommendation is p4. \n\nHowever, the user's query might be considering the briefing on April 16 itself. The search result [9] mentions an upcoming event at 6:00 pm ET on April 16, which is a prayer service, not a press briefing. The latest briefing mentioned is on April 15. Therefore, the next briefing after April 16 would be on a subsequent date, which is in the future. Hence, p4 is the correct recommendation.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.485, ID: 93178023182441177448296368144493873859872400392155282458105980465406899302479, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.515, ID: 25715461830361504776455442250334088944131371699086399665709259654903777356427, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
