      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Carlos Alcaraz vs. Arthur Fils semifinal match at the 2025 Barcelona Open. The resolution depends on who advances to the final. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Fils, p2 is Alcaraz, and p3 is 50-50 if the match is tied, canceled, or delayed beyond May 28, 2025. The primary source is the Monte-Carlo Masters website, but credible reporting can also be used.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already occurred. The current timestamp is April 19, 2025, 15:28:23 UTC, and the match was scheduled for April 19 at 10:00 AM ET, which is 14:00 UTC. So the match should have already taken place. However, the search results don't provide any direct information about the match outcome. All the sources are from before the match, with predictions and previews.\n\nLooking at the search results, most of them are previews and predictions. For example, sources [1], [3], [7], and [14] predict Alcaraz to win, citing his form and past performance. Source [2] mentions Alcaraz's complaints about the court conditions but still shows he's performing well. Source [5] states that Fils advanced to the semifinals after Tsitsipas retired, but that's about the quarterfinals. Source [13] from ESPN confirms that Alcaraz beat de Minaur and was set to face Fils, but doesn't provide the semifinal result.\n\nSince there's no post-match report in the provided sources, I need to check if the event was delayed or canceled. The user mentioned that if the match is delayed beyond May 28, it resolves to p3. However, the match was supposed to happen on April 19, and there's no indication of a delay in the search results. All sources up to [14] (dated April 18) discuss the upcoming match, and none mention a postponement.\n\nGiven the lack of post-match data, but considering the match date has passed, I should infer the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The ancillary data says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. All predictions heavily favor Alcaraz, and he's the two-time champion with a 13-match winning streak in Barcelona. There's no evidence of the match being canceled or delayed. Therefore, the resolution should be p2 (Alcaraz).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745076503 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-19 15:28:23 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Carlos Alcaraz vs. Arthur Fils semifinal match at the 2025 Barcelona Open. The resolution depends on who advances to the final. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Fils, p2 is Alcaraz, and p3 is 50-50 if the match is tied, canceled, or delayed beyond May 28, 2025. The primary source is the Monte-Carlo Masters website, but credible reporting can also be used.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already occurred. The current timestamp is April 19, 2025, 15:28:23 UTC, and the match was scheduled for April 19 at 10:00 AM ET, which is 14:00 UTC. So the match should have already taken place. However, the search results don't provide any direct information about the match outcome. All the sources are from before the match, with predictions and previews.\n\nLooking at the search results, most of them are previews and predictions. For example, sources [1], [3], [7], and [14] predict Alcaraz to win, citing his form and past performance. Source [2] mentions Alcaraz's complaints about the court conditions but still shows he's performing well. Source [5] states that Fils advanced to the semifinals after Tsitsipas retired, but that's about the quarterfinals. Source [13] from ESPN confirms that Alcaraz beat de Minaur and was set to face Fils, but doesn't provide the semifinal result.\n\nSince there's no post-match report in the provided sources, I need to check if the event was delayed or canceled. The user mentioned that if the match is delayed beyond May 28, it resolves to p3. However, the match was supposed to happen on April 19, and there's no indication of a delay in the search results. All sources up to [14] (dated April 18) discuss the upcoming match, and none mention a postponement.\n\nGiven the lack of post-match data, but considering the match date has passed, I should infer the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The ancillary data says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. All predictions heavily favor Alcaraz, and he's the two-time champion with a 13-match winning streak in Barcelona. There's no evidence of the match being canceled or delayed. Therefore, the resolution should be p2 (Alcaraz).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Alcaraz , Price: 0.9895, ID: 2830595151498489674363939973500823911510021919376047405063272442361772323015, Winner: No\n- Token: Fils, Price: 0.0105, ID: 112678457239782629450022685534902473318793612908138861519919572218348639661700, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Fils, p2 to Alcaraz , p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Fils, p2 = Alcaraz\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Alcaraz  outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.990 = 99.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
