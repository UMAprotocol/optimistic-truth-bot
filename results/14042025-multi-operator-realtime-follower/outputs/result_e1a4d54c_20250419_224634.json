Your task is to analyze the provided query and decide which AI solver is best suited to handle it.\n\nAvailable solvers: perplexity\n\nSolver descriptions:\n- perplexity: Uses the Perplexity AI search engine to find information online to answer general questions. Best for:\n  * Historical data and events\n  * General knowledge questions requiring context\n  * Questions needing interpretation of complex information\n  * Has knowledge cutoff and may not have very recent information\n\n- code_runner: Executes code to fetch real-time data from specific APIs. Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Available Crypto Data Sources:\n    - Binance: Provides cryptocurrency price data for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies\n  * Available Sports Data Sources:\n    - Sports Data IO - MLB (baseball): MLB baseball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NBA (basketball): NBA basketball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NFL (football): NFL football scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NHL (hockey): NHL hockey scores, statistics, and game data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Cleveland Guardians vs. Pittsburgh Pirates, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for April 19 at 4:05PM ET:\nIf the Cleveland Guardians win, the market will resolve to \"Cleveland Guardians\".\nIf the Pittsburgh Pirates win, the market will resolve to \"Pittsburgh Pirates\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Pittsburgh Pirates, p2 to Cleveland Guardians, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Cleveland Guardians vs. Pittsburgh Pirates, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for April 19 at 4:05PM ET:\nIf the Cleveland Guardians win, the market will resolve to \"Cleveland Guardians\".\nIf the Pittsburgh Pirates win, the market will resolve to \"Pittsburgh Pirates\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Pittsburgh Pirates, p2 to Cleveland Guardians, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745102512 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-19 22:41:52 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport logging\n\n# Load API key from .env file\nload_dotenv()\nMLB_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\n\n# Constants for resolution mapping\nRESOLUTION_MAP = {\n    \"Cleveland Guardians\": \"p2\",\n    \"Pittsburgh Pirates\": \"p1\",\n    \"50-50\": \"p3\",\n    \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\",\n}\n\n# Configure logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.INFO)\nhandler = logging.StreamHandler()\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nhandler.setFormatter(formatter)\nlogger.addHandler(handler)\n\ndef fetch_game_data():\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches game data for the specified date and teams.\n    \"\"\"\n    date = \"2025-04-19\"\n    team1 = \"Cleveland Guardians\"\n    team2 = \"Pittsburgh Pirates\"\n    url = f\"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json/GamesByDate/{date}?key={MLB_API_KEY}\"\n\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        games = response.json()\n\n        for game in games:\n            if (game['HomeTeam'] == team1 and game['AwayTeam'] == team2) or (game['HomeTeam'] == team2 and game['AwayTeam'] == team1):\n                return game\n        return None\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        logger.error(f\"API request failed: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef determine_resolution(game):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the resolution based on the game's status and outcome.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not game:\n        return \"p4\"  # Too early to resolve\n\n    if game['Status'] == \"Final\":\n        if game['HomeTeamRuns'] > game['AwayTeamRuns']:\n            winner = game['HomeTeam']\n        else:\n            winner = game['AwayTeam']\n\n        if winner == \"Cleveland Guardians\":\n            return \"p2\"\n        elif winner == \"Pittsburgh Pirates\":\n            return \"p1\"\n    elif game['Status'] == \"Canceled\":\n        return \"p3\"\n    elif game['Status'] == \"Postponed\":\n        return \"p4\"\n\n    return \"p4\"\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to determine the resolution of the MLB game.\n    \"\"\"\n    game_data = fetch_game_data()\n    resolution = determine_resolution(game_data)\n    print(f\"recommendation: {resolution}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p4\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful. Recommendation found: p4.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p4\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Cleveland Guardians, Price: 0.5, ID: 43592722581747356287280027341934700332834170539594663800596244337959912825004, Winner: No\n- Token: Pittsburgh Pirates, Price: 0.5, ID: 89857509861552858515434723056334628177689860575173603679062808786411655683581, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Pittsburgh Pirates, p2 to Cleveland Guardians, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Pittsburgh Pirates, p2 = Cleveland Guardians\n\nInterpretation: Market slightly favors Cleveland Guardians (maps to p2 in resolution conditions), but not decisively (0.500 vs 0.500)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Cleveland Guardians vs. Pittsburgh Pirates, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for April 19 at 4:05PM ET:\nIf the Cleveland Guardians win, the market will resolve to \"Cleveland Guardians\".\nIf the Pittsburgh Pirates win, the market will resolve to \"Pittsburgh Pirates\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Pittsburgh Pirates, p2 to Cleveland Guardians, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745102512 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-19 22:41:52 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources.

If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Cleveland Guardians vs. Pittsburgh Pirates, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for April 19 at 4:05PM ET:\nIf the Cleveland Guardians win, the market will resolve to \"Cleveland Guardians\".\nIf the Pittsburgh Pirates win, the market will resolve to \"Pittsburgh Pirates\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Pittsburgh Pirates, p2 to Cleveland Guardians, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745102512 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-19 22:41:52 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please ensure the code checks the exact date and time of the game, including time zone considerations, to accurately determine if the game has occurred. Additionally, verify if the game status corresponds to the actual event outcome on the specified date.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport logging\n\n# Load API key from .env file\nload_dotenv()\nMLB_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\n\n# Constants - RESOLUTION MAPPING using team names\nRESOLUTION_MAP = {\n    \"CLE\": \"p2\",  # Cleveland Guardians win maps to p2\n    \"PIT\": \"p1\",  # Pittsburgh Pirates win maps to p1\n    \"50-50\": \"p3\",  # Canceled or no make-up game maps to p3\n    \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\",  # Incomplete data maps to p4\n}\n\n# Configure logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\nhandler = logging.StreamHandler()\nhandler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nhandler.setFormatter(formatter)\nlogger.addHandler(handler)\n\ndef fetch_game_data():\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches game data for the specified date and teams.\n    \"\"\"\n    date = \"2025-04-19\"\n    team1 = \"CLE\"\n    team2 = \"PIT\"\n    url = f\"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json/GamesByDate/{date}?key={MLB_API_KEY}\"\n\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        games = response.json()\n\n        for game in games:\n            if game['HomeTeam'] == team1 and game['AwayTeam'] == team2 or game['HomeTeam'] == team2 and game['AwayTeam'] == team1:\n                return game\n        return None\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        logger.error(f\"API request failed: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef determine_resolution(game):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the resolution based on the game's status and outcome.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not game:\n        return \"p4\"  # No game data available\n\n    if game['Status'] == \"Final\":\n        if game['HomeTeamRuns'] > game['AwayTeamRuns']:\n            winner = game['HomeTeam']\n        else:\n            winner = game['AwayTeam']\n        return RESOLUTION_MAP.get(winner, \"p4\")\n    elif game['Status'] == \"Canceled\":\n        return \"p3\"\n    elif game['Status'] == \"Postponed\":\n        return \"p4\"\n    else:\n        return \"p4\"\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to query MLB game data and determine the resolution.\n    \"\"\"\n    game = fetch_game_data()\n    resolution = determine_resolution(game)\n    print(f\"recommendation: {resolution}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p4\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Where p1 corresponds to Pittsburgh Pirates, p2 to Cleveland Guardians, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Pittsburgh Pirates, p2 = Cleveland Guardians\n\nInterpretation: Market slightly favors Cleveland Guardians (maps to p2 in resolution conditions), but not decisively (0.500 vs 0.500)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Cleveland Guardians vs. Pittsburgh Pirates, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for April 19 at 4:05PM ET:\nIf the Cleveland Guardians win, the market will resolve to \"Cleveland Guardians\".\nIf the Pittsburgh Pirates win, the market will resolve to \"Pittsburgh Pirates\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Pittsburgh Pirates, p2 to Cleveland Guardians, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745102512 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-19 22:41:52 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please ensure the code checks the exact date and time of the game, including time zone considerations, to accurately determine if the game has occurred. Additionally, verify if the game status corresponds to the actual event outcome on the specified date.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please ensure the code checks the exact time of the game against the current timestamp to confirm if the game has already occurred. Additionally, verify the game status more robustly to determine if it was played, postponed, or canceled.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nimport pytz\nimport logging\n\n# Load environment variables\nload_dotenv()\nMLB_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\n\n# Constants\nRESOLUTION_MAP = {\n    \"CLE\": \"p2\",  # Cleveland Guardians win\n    \"PIT\": \"p1\",  # Pittsburgh Pirates win\n    \"50-50\": \"p3\",  # Game canceled or postponed without resolution\n    \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\"  # Game has not occurred yet or no data available\n}\nGAME_DATE = \"2025-04-19\"\nGAME_TIME = \"16:05:00\"\nTEAM1 = \"Cleveland Guardians\"\nTEAM2 = \"Pittsburgh Pirates\"\nTIMEZONE = \"America/New_York\"\n\n# Configure logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n\ndef fetch_game_data():\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches game data for the specified date and teams from the SportsDataIO MLB API.\n    \"\"\"\n    date = datetime.strptime(f\"{GAME_DATE} {GAME_TIME}\", \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n    date = pytz.timezone(TIMEZONE).localize(date)\n    current_time = datetime.now(pytz.timezone(TIMEZONE))\n\n    if current_time < date:\n        logging.info(\"Game has not started yet.\")\n        return \"Too early to resolve\"\n\n    url = f\"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json/GamesByDate/{GAME_DATE}?key={MLB_API_KEY}\"\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        games = response.json()\n\n        for game in games:\n            if game['HomeTeam'] == 'CLE' and game['AwayTeam'] == 'PIT' or game['HomeTeam'] == 'PIT' and game['AwayTeam'] == 'CLE':\n                if game['Status'] == \"Final\":\n                    home_score = game['HomeTeamRuns']\n                    away_score = game['AwayTeamRuns']\n                    if home_score > away_score:\n                        return RESOLUTION_MAP[game['HomeTeam']]\n                    else:\n                        return RESOLUTION_MAP[game['AwayTeam']]\n                elif game['Status'] in [\"Canceled\", \"Postponed\"]:\n                    return \"50-50\"\n                else:\n                    return \"Too early to resolve\"\n    except requests.RequestException as e:\n        logging.error(f\"Error fetching game data: {e}\")\n        return \"Too early to resolve\"\n\n    return \"Too early to resolve\"\n\ndef main():\n    resolution = fetch_game_data()\n    print(f\"recommendation: {RESOLUTION_MAP.get(resolution, 'p4')}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p4\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Cleveland Guardians vs. Pittsburgh Pirates game on April 19, 2025, at 4:05 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Pirates win, p2 for Guardians win, p3 if canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is April 19, 2025, 10:44 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. So the event date is in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, most sources (1, 2, 6, 9, 11, 12) report that the Guardians won the game 10-7 on April 18. Wait, the game in question is April 19, but these results are about the April 18 game. The user's query is about the April 19 game. There's a mix-up here. Let me check the dates again.\n\nWait, the search results include articles from April 19 discussing the upcoming game on April 19 (sources 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10). For example, source 3 is a prediction for the April 19 game, and source 4 has the date as April 19, 2025, with the Pirates vs. Guardians matchup. Source 5 also mentions the April 19 game. However, the actual game results provided are from April 18 (sources 1, 2, 6, 9, 11, 12). \n\nThe user's query is about the game on April 19. The search results don't include any reports of the April 19 game's outcome. All the game recaps are from April 18. The current timestamp is April 19, 10:44 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time (4:05 PM ET, which is 8:05 PM UTC). So the game should have concluded, but there's no result reported in the provided sources. \n\nWait, source 7 is an ESPN preview for the April 19 game, but it doesn't have the result. Sources 3, 4, 5, 8, 10 are predictions or odds for the April 19 game. The actual game might not have been played yet, or the results aren't in the provided search context. However, the current date is April 19, 2025, 10:44 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. If the game was played, the results should be available. But the provided search results don't include any post-game articles for April 19. \n\nThis creates a problem. The user's ancillary data specifies that if the game is postponed or canceled, it resolves accordingly. But without any sources confirming the outcome, I can't verify if the game was played, postponed, or canceled. The search results only have pre-game info and the previous day's game. \n\nAccording to the personalization instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The ancillary data says if the game is canceled, resolve p3. But without any info, maybe the game was played, and we need to infer. However, the user's instructions say to rely strictly on provided sources. Since there's no post-game data for April 19, and the sources only have pre-game info, it's possible the game was postponed or not reported. But the user's current timestamp is after the game, so if it was played, the results should be there. \n\nWait, maybe there's confusion in the dates. The user's query mentions the game on April 19, but the search results have a game on April 18 where Guardians won. The April 19 game is a different matchup. Since the provided sources don't include the April 19 game's result, and the current date is after the scheduled time, but no sources confirm the outcome, I have to check if the event was postponed or canceled. \n\nHowever, the personalization instructions state that if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The ancillary data for the market resolution has p2 as Guardians win. But without any data, it's risky. However, the user might have provided the wrong date, but the query is clear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the date, and the game in question is April 18, which the Guardians won. But the query explicitly states April 19. Given that, and the lack of post-game sources for April 19, I have to conclude that the game might have been postponed or the results aren't available. However, the personalization instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data's resolution conditions don't have a p4, but the initial instructions mention p4 for unresolved. Wait, the resolution_conditions in the user's query are p1, p2, p3. The personalization instructions say to end with recommendation p1-p4. The user's ancillary_data has p3 as 0.5 for canceled. \n\nBut according to the personalization rules: if the event is in the past and no verifiable info, and not postponed/canceled, resolve based on most probable outcome. However, without any data, it's impossible. Since the provided sources don't include the April 19 game's result, and the current date is after the event, but the sources only have pre-game info, I have to assume the game was either not played or the result isn't available. Therefore, the resolution would be p3 (canceled) or p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's resolution_conditions don't include p4. Wait, the user's ancillary_data says p3 is 0.5 for canceled. The personalization instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, and not postponed/canceled, resolve based on most probable outcome. But if the event was scheduled for the same day but later time, it's future. Wait, the current timestamp is 2025-04-19 22:41:52 UTC, and the game was at 4:05 PM ET, which is 20:05 UTC. So the game was scheduled for 8:05 PM UTC on April 19, and the current time is 10:44 PM UTC, which is after. So the game should have happened. But the search results don't include any post-game info for April 19. \n\nThis is conflicting. The user provided search results up to April 19, but the game on April 19 isn't covered in the results. The only results are for April 18 and predictions for April 19. Therefore, according to the instructions, if no verifiable information is available, and the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data's resolution_conditions have p2 as Cleveland Guardians win. But without any data, how to determine? Alternatively, maybe the game was played, and the result isn't in the provided sources. In that case, the instructions say to answer as well as possible with existing knowledge. But I can't use external knowledge. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended the April 18 game, but the query is about April 19. This is a problem. Given the confusion, and following the instructions strictly, since the provided search results don't include the outcome of the April 19 game, and the event date is in the past, but no sources confirm the result, I have to resolve as p4 (cannot be resolved). However, the user's resolution_conditions don't include p4, only p1, p2, p3. Wait, the personalization instructions say to end with recommendation p1-p4. The user's ancillary_data has p3 as 50-50 if canceled. But if the game was played and no result is found, perhaps it's p4. However, the instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume most probable outcome. But without any data, it's impossible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game was played, and the result is not in the provided sources. In that case, I have to answer based on existing knowledge, but the instructions say to use only provided sources. Therefore, since there's no information on the April 19 game's outcome in the provided sources, and the event date is in the past, the resolution would be p4. However, the user's resolution_conditions don't have p4. This is conflicting. \n\nWait, the user's ancillary_data says resolution_conditions: p1: Pirates, p2: Guardians, p3: 50-50. The personalization instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, resolve based on most probable outcome. But without any sources, I can't determine. Therefore, according to the instructions, if no verifiable info, and the event date is in the past, resolve p4. But the user's resolution_conditions don't have p4. This is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the date, and the game in question is April 18, which the Guardians won. But the query explicitly states April 19. Given that, and the lack of data, I have to conclude that the market cannot be resolved (p4). However, the user's resolution_conditions don't include p4. This is a conflict. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game was postponed. The ancillary_data says if postponed, the market remains open. But the current date is after the scheduled time, so if postponed, it's still open. However, without any sources indicating postponement, I can't confirm. \n\nThis is a tricky situation. The correct approach, following the instructions, is: if the event date is in the past, and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. But without any data, it's impossible. Therefore, the recommendation would be p4. However, the user's resolution_conditions don't have p4. Alternatively, if the event was not played, resolve p3. But without info on cancellation, I can't confirm. \n\nGiven the strict instructions and the provided sources, which don't include the April 19 game's result, the only conclusion is that there's no verifiable information, so the recommendation is p4. But the user's ancillary_data doesn't have p4. This suggests a possible error in the setup. However, according to the personalization instructions, the final recommendation must be p1-p4. Therefore, despite the user's resolution_conditions not including p4, the correct recommendation based on lack of information is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

The current date is April 19, 2025, 10:44 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. So the event date is in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, most sources (1, 2, 6, 9, 11, 12) report that the Guardians won the game 10-7 on April 18. Wait, the game in question is April 19, but these results are about the April 18 game. The user's query is about the April 19 game. There's a mix-up here. Let me check the dates again.\n\nWait, the search results include articles from April 19 discussing the upcoming game on April 19 (sources 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10). For example, source 3 is a prediction for the April 19 game, and source 4 has the date as April 19, 2025, with the Pirates vs. Guardians matchup. Source 5 also mentions the April 19 game. However, the actual game results provided are from April 18 (sources 1, 2, 6, 9, 11, 12). \n\nThe user's query is about the game on April 19. The search results don't include any reports of the April 19 game's outcome. All the game recaps are from April 18. The current timestamp is April 19, 10:44 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time (4:05 PM ET, which is 8:05 PM UTC). So the game should have concluded, but there's no result reported in the provided sources. \n\nWait, source 7 is an ESPN preview for the April 19 game, but it doesn't have the result. Sources 3, 4, 5, 8, 10 are predictions or odds for the April 19 game. The actual game might not have been played yet, or the results aren't in the provided search context. However, the current date is April 19, 2025, 10:44 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. If the game was played, the results should be available. But the provided search results don't include any post-game articles for April 19. \n\nThis creates a problem. The user's ancillary data specifies that if the game is postponed or canceled, it resolves accordingly. But without any sources confirming the outcome, I can't verify if the game was played, postponed, or canceled. The search results only have pre-game info and the previous day's game. \n\nAccording to the personalization instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The ancillary data says if the game is canceled, resolve p3. But without any info, maybe the game was played, and we need to infer. However, the user's instructions say to rely strictly on provided sources. Since there's no post-game data for April 19, and the sources only have pre-game info, it's possible the game was postponed or not reported. But the user's current timestamp is after the game, so if it was played, the results should be there. \n\nWait, maybe there's confusion in the dates. The user's query mentions the game on April 19, but the search results have a game on April 18 where Guardians won. The April 19 game is a different matchup. Since the provided sources don't include the April 19 game's result, and the current date is after the scheduled time, but no sources confirm the outcome, I have to check if the event was postponed or canceled. \n\nHowever, the personalization instructions state that if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The ancillary data for the market resolution has p2 as Guardians win. But without any data, it's risky. However, the user might have provided the wrong date, but the query is clear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the date, and the game in question is April 18, which the Guardians won. But the query explicitly states April 19. Given that, and the lack of post-game sources for April 19, I have to conclude that the game might have been postponed or the results aren't available. However, the personalization instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data's resolution conditions don't have a p4, but the initial instructions mention p4 for unresolved. Wait, the resolution_conditions in the user's query are p1, p2, p3. The personalization instructions say to end with recommendation p1-p4. The user's ancillary_data has p3 as 0.5 for canceled. \n\nBut according to the personalization rules: if the event is in the past and no verifiable info, and not postponed/canceled, resolve based on most probable outcome. However, without any data, it's impossible. Since the provided sources don't include the April 19 game's result, and the current date is after the event, but the sources only have pre-game info, I have to assume the game was either not played or the result isn't available. Therefore, the resolution would be p3 (canceled) or p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's resolution_conditions don't include p4. Wait, the user's ancillary_data says p3 is 0.5 for canceled. The personalization instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, and not postponed/canceled, resolve based on most probable outcome. But if the event was scheduled for the same day but later time, it's future. Wait, the current timestamp is 2025-04-19 22:41:52 UTC, and the game was at 4:05 PM ET, which is 20:05 UTC. So the game was scheduled for 8:05 PM UTC on April 19, and the current time is 10:44 PM UTC, which is after. So the game should have happened. But the search results don't include any post-game info for April 19. \n\nThis is conflicting. The user provided search results up to April 19, but the game on April 19 isn't covered in the results. The only results are for April 18 and predictions for April 19. Therefore, according to the instructions, if no verifiable information is available, and the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data's resolution_conditions have p2 as Cleveland Guardians win. But without any data, how to determine? Alternatively, maybe the game was played, and the result isn't in the provided sources. In that case, the instructions say to answer as well as possible with existing knowledge. But I can't use external knowledge. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended the April 18 game, but the query is about April 19. This is a problem. Given the confusion, and following the instructions strictly, since the provided search results don't include the outcome of the April 19 game, and the event date is in the past, but no sources confirm the result, I have to resolve as p4 (cannot be resolved). However, the user's resolution_conditions don't include p4, only p1, p2, p3. Wait, the personalization instructions say to end with recommendation p1-p4. The user's ancillary_data has p3 as 50-50 if canceled. But if the game was played and no result is found, perhaps it's p4. However, the instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume most probable outcome. But without any data, it's impossible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game was played, and the result is not in the provided sources. In that case, I have to answer based on existing knowledge, but the instructions say to use only provided sources. Therefore, since there's no information on the April 19 game's outcome in the provided sources, and the event date is in the past, the resolution would be p4. However, the user's resolution_conditions don't have p4. This is conflicting. \n\nWait, the user's ancillary_data says resolution_conditions: p1: Pirates, p2: Guardians, p3: 50-50. The personalization instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, resolve based on most probable outcome. But without any sources, I can't determine. Therefore, according to the instructions, if no verifiable info, and the event date is in the past, resolve p4. But the user's resolution_conditions don't have p4. This is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the date, and the game in question is April 18, which the Guardians won. But the query explicitly states April 19. Given that, and the lack of data, I have to conclude that the market cannot be resolved (p4). However, the user's resolution_conditions don't include p4. This is a conflict. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game was postponed. The ancillary_data says if postponed, the market remains open. But the current date is after the scheduled time, so if postponed, it's still open. However, without any sources indicating postponement, I can't confirm. \n\nThis is a tricky situation. The correct approach, following the instructions, is: if the event date is in the past, and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. But without any data, it's impossible. Therefore, the recommendation would be p4. However, the user's resolution_conditions don't have p4. Alternatively, if the event was not played, resolve p3. But without info on cancellation, I can't confirm. \n\nGiven the strict instructions and the provided sources, which don't include the April 19 game's result, the only conclusion is that there's no verifiable information, so the recommendation is p4. But the user's ancillary_data doesn't have p4. This suggests a possible error in the setup. However, according to the personalization instructions, the final recommendation must be p1-p4. Therefore, despite the user's resolution_conditions not including p4, the correct recommendation based on lack of information is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Cleveland Guardians, Price: 0.5, ID: 43592722581747356287280027341934700332834170539594663800596244337959912825004, Winner: No\n- Token: Pittsburgh Pirates, Price: 0.5, ID: 89857509861552858515434723056334628177689860575173603679062808786411655683581, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Pittsburgh Pirates, p2 to Cleveland Guardians, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Pittsburgh Pirates, p2 = Cleveland Guardians\n\nInterpretation: Market slightly favors Cleveland Guardians (maps to p2 in resolution conditions), but not decisively (0.500 vs 0.500)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Cleveland Guardians vs. Pittsburgh Pirates game scheduled for April 19, 2025, at 4:05 PM ET. The key here is to determine if the game was played as scheduled, postponed, or canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp is April 19, 2025, 10:41 PM UTC, which is after the scheduled game time. So the game should have already happened. Now, looking at the search results provided, most of them are about the game on April 18, where the Guardians won 10-7. But the query is about the April 19 game. \n\nWait, the user's ancillary data mentions the game on April 19 at 4:05 PM ET. The search results include a preview for the April 19 game, like the CBS Sports link [4] and others [3][7][8], which discuss the upcoming matchup between Ben Lively and Paul Skenes. However, the actual results from April 19 aren't present in the provided search results. All the game highlights and recaps are from April 18. \n\nThis is confusing. The user might have mixed up the dates. The query is about the April 19 game, but the search results don't show any post-game data for that date. The current date is April 19, 2025, in the evening, so the game should have concluded. However, the available sources only cover the April 18 game. There's no information indicating that the April 19 game was postponed or canceled. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that if the game is postponed, the market remains open, and if canceled, it resolves 50-50. Since there's no evidence of postponement or cancellation in the search results, but also no confirmation that the game was played, I need to infer. The lack of results might mean the game wasn't played, but that's speculative. Alternatively, maybe the sources haven't been updated yet. \n\nHowever, the user's additional instruction says to focus on verifying if the game was canceled or postponed. Since the search results don't mention any changes to the April 19 game schedule, and the previews from [3][7][8] discuss the April 19 game as upcoming, but there's no follow-up, it's possible the game proceeded as planned. But without post-game data, I can't confirm the outcome. \n\nWait, the current timestamp is April 19, 10:45 PM UTC, which is 6:45 PM ET. The game was scheduled for 4:05 PM ET, so it should have ended by now. But the search results don't include any post-game information for April 19. This could mean the game was postponed or the results aren't in the provided sources. However, the absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence. \n\nAccording to the instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome exists, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data says p3 is 0.5 if canceled. Since there's no info on cancellation or postponement, but the game date has passed, and no outcome is reported, the market should resolve to p3. But wait, the user's additional instruction says to focus on verifying cancellation or postponement. Since the sources don't mention it, and the game was scheduled, perhaps it was played. But without results, we can't confirm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the April 19 game is the one mentioned in the previews, and the user provided the wrong date. But the query clearly states April 19. Given the confusion and lack of post-game data, and following the instruction to resolve p3 if no verifiable info, the recommendation would be p3. However, the ancillary data says p3 is for canceled games. If the game was played but the outcome isn't known, it's not covered. The instructions say if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without any data, it's unclear. \n\nWait, looking at source [4], the end mentions the next game on April 19 with Ben Lively vs. Paul Skenes. But there's no result. The current date is April 19, so if the game happened, but there's no report here, maybe it was postponed. But without any sources stating that, I can't confirm. The safe resolution is p3, as the outcome can't be verified from the provided sources.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3",

Focus on verifying whether the game was canceled or postponed, as this directly impacts the resolution condition p3.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Cleveland Guardians vs. Pittsburgh Pirates game scheduled for April 19, 2025, at 4:05 PM ET. The key here is to determine if the game was played as scheduled, postponed, or canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp is April 19, 2025, 10:41 PM UTC, which is after the scheduled game time. So the game should have already happened. Now, looking at the search results provided, most of them are about the game on April 18, where the Guardians won 10-7. But the query is about the April 19 game. \n\nWait, the user's ancillary data mentions the game on April 19 at 4:05 PM ET. The search results include a preview for the April 19 game, like the CBS Sports link [4] and others [3][7][8], which discuss the upcoming matchup between Ben Lively and Paul Skenes. However, the actual results from April 19 aren't present in the provided search results. All the game highlights and recaps are from April 18. \n\nThis is confusing. The user might have mixed up the dates. The query is about the April 19 game, but the search results don't show any post-game data for that date. The current date is April 19, 2025, in the evening, so the game should have concluded. However, the available sources only cover the April 18 game. There's no information indicating that the April 19 game was postponed or canceled. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that if the game is postponed, the market remains open, and if canceled, it resolves 50-50. Since there's no evidence of postponement or cancellation in the search results, but also no confirmation that the game was played, I need to infer. The lack of results might mean the game wasn't played, but that's speculative. Alternatively, maybe the sources haven't been updated yet. \n\nHowever, the user's additional instruction says to focus on verifying if the game was canceled or postponed. Since the search results don't mention any changes to the April 19 game schedule, and the previews from [3][7][8] discuss the April 19 game as upcoming, but there's no follow-up, it's possible the game proceeded as planned. But without post-game data, I can't confirm the outcome. \n\nWait, the current timestamp is April 19, 10:45 PM UTC, which is 6:45 PM ET. The game was scheduled for 4:05 PM ET, so it should have ended by now. But the search results don't include any post-game information for April 19. This could mean the game was postponed or the results aren't in the provided sources. However, the absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence. \n\nAccording to the instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome exists, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data says p3 is 0.5 if canceled. Since there's no info on cancellation or postponement, but the game date has passed, and no outcome is reported, the market should resolve to p3. But wait, the user's additional instruction says to focus on verifying cancellation or postponement. Since the sources don't mention it, and the game was scheduled, perhaps it was played. But without results, we can't confirm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the April 19 game is the one mentioned in the previews, and the user provided the wrong date. But the query clearly states April 19. Given the confusion and lack of post-game data, and following the instruction to resolve p3 if no verifiable info, the recommendation would be p3. However, the ancillary data says p3 is for canceled games. If the game was played but the outcome isn't known, it's not covered. The instructions say if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without any data, it's unclear. \n\nWait, looking at source [4], the end mentions the next game on April 19 with Ben Lively vs. Paul Skenes. But there's no result. The current date is April 19, so if the game happened, but there's no report here, maybe it was postponed. But without any sources stating that, I can't confirm. The safe resolution is p3, as the outcome can't be verified from the provided sources.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Cleveland Guardians, Price: 0.5, ID: 43592722581747356287280027341934700332834170539594663800596244337959912825004, Winner: No\n- Token: Pittsburgh Pirates, Price: 0.5, ID: 89857509861552858515434723056334628177689860575173603679062808786411655683581, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Pittsburgh Pirates, p2 to Cleveland Guardians, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Pittsburgh Pirates, p2 = Cleveland Guardians\n\nInterpretation: Market slightly favors Cleveland Guardians (maps to p2 in resolution conditions), but not decisively (0.500 vs 0.500)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Cleveland Guardians vs. Pittsburgh Pirates game scheduled for April 19, 2025, at 4:05 PM ET. The key here is to determine if the game happened as planned, was postponed, or canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. Looking at the sources, most of them reference the game on April 18, 2025. For example, sources [1], [2], [4], [5], [6], and [7] all discuss the game from April 18 where the Guardians won 10-7. However, the query is about the game on April 19. \n\nSource [3] mentions a game on April 19, 2025, between the Pirates and Guardians, with details like the starting pitchers and odds. Source [8] also talks about a prediction for the April 19 game, giving odds and a score prediction. But there's no actual report of the game's outcome on April 19 in the provided search results. \n\nThe current timestamp given is April 19, 2025, at 10:46 PM UTC, which is after the scheduled game time (4:05 PM ET, which is 8:05 PM UTC). Since the game was supposed to have already occurred, but there's no mention of it being played, postponed, or canceled in the search results, I need to infer. \n\nThe ancillary data states that if the game is postponed, the market remains open. If canceled, it resolves to 50-50 (p3). However, the search results don't provide any information about the April 19 game's status. The absence of reports suggesting a postponement or cancellation might imply the game was played, but without confirmation, it's risky to assume. \n\nBut wait, the user's personalization instructions say that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, we should assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The conditions here are the resolution rules. Since there's no info, and the game date has passed, but no sources confirm the outcome, the safest resolution is p3 (50-50) because we can't verify the result. However, the user also mentioned that if the event is in the past and no info is available, but the user prompt doesn't mention postponement or cancellation, resolve based on the most probable outcome. \n\nBut the problem is the search results don't mention the April 19 game at all, except for previews and predictions. The actual game in the sources is April 18. This could mean that the April 19 game hasn't been reported yet in the provided sources, or maybe it was postponed. However, the current timestamp is April 19 at 10:46 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. If the game had happened, there should be some mention, but there isn't. \n\nGiven the strict instructions to rely only on provided sources and not external knowledge, and since the sources don't report the April 19 game's outcome, the resolution should be p3 (50-50) because the outcome isn't verifiable from the given data. However, the user's personalization also says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without any data, how can we assume? The ancillary data's p3 is for canceled or unresolved, so in this case, since there's no info, p3 is appropriate.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3",

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745102512 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-19 22:41:52 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please provide a more concise analysis directly addressing the resolution conditions specified in the query. Focus on verifying whether the game was canceled or postponed, as this directly impacts the resolution condition p3.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please provide a more focused analysis on verifying the occurrence of the game on April 19, 2025, and whether it was played, postponed, or canceled based on reliable sources. Avoid speculative conclusions and ensure the recommendation aligns with verified event outcomes.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Cleveland Guardians vs. Pittsburgh Pirates game scheduled for April 19, 2025, at 4:05 PM ET. The key here is to determine if the game happened as planned, was postponed, or canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. Looking at the sources, most of them reference the game on April 18, 2025. For example, sources [1], [2], [4], [5], [6], and [7] all discuss the game from April 18 where the Guardians won 10-7. However, the query is about the game on April 19. \n\nSource [3] mentions a game on April 19, 2025, between the Pirates and Guardians, with details like the starting pitchers and odds. Source [8] also talks about a prediction for the April 19 game, giving odds and a score prediction. But there's no actual report of the game's outcome on April 19 in the provided search results. \n\nThe current timestamp given is April 19, 2025, at 10:46 PM UTC, which is after the scheduled game time (4:05 PM ET, which is 8:05 PM UTC). Since the game was supposed to have already occurred, but there's no mention of it being played, postponed, or canceled in the search results, I need to infer. \n\nThe ancillary data states that if the game is postponed, the market remains open. If canceled, it resolves to 50-50 (p3). However, the search results don't provide any information about the April 19 game's status. The absence of reports suggesting a postponement or cancellation might imply the game was played, but without confirmation, it's risky to assume. \n\nBut wait, the user's personalization instructions say that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, we should assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The conditions here are the resolution rules. Since there's no info, and the game date has passed, but no sources confirm the outcome, the safest resolution is p3 (50-50) because we can't verify the result. However, the user also mentioned that if the event is in the past and no info is available, but the user prompt doesn't mention postponement or cancellation, resolve based on the most probable outcome. \n\nBut the problem is the search results don't mention the April 19 game at all, except for previews and predictions. The actual game in the sources is April 18. This could mean that the April 19 game hasn't been reported yet in the provided sources, or maybe it was postponed. However, the current timestamp is April 19 at 10:46 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. If the game had happened, there should be some mention, but there isn't. \n\nGiven the strict instructions to rely only on provided sources and not external knowledge, and since the sources don't report the April 19 game's outcome, the resolution should be p3 (50-50) because the outcome isn't verifiable from the given data. However, the user's personalization also says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without any data, how can we assume? The ancillary data's p3 is for canceled or unresolved, so in this case, since there's no info, p3 is appropriate.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Cleveland Guardians, Price: 0.5, ID: 43592722581747356287280027341934700332834170539594663800596244337959912825004, Winner: No\n- Token: Pittsburgh Pirates, Price: 0.5, ID: 89857509861552858515434723056334628177689860575173603679062808786411655683581, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Pittsburgh Pirates, p2 to Cleveland Guardians, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Pittsburgh Pirates, p2 = Cleveland Guardians\n\nInterpretation: Market slightly favors Cleveland Guardians (maps to p2 in resolution conditions), but not decisively (0.500 vs 0.500)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745102512 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-19 22:41:52 UTC",
