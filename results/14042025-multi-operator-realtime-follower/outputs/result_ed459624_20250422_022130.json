Your task is to analyze the provided query and decide which AI solver is best suited to handle it.\n\nAvailable solvers: perplexity\n\nSolver descriptions:\n- perplexity: Uses the Perplexity AI search engine to find information online to answer general questions. Best for:\n  * Historical data and events\n  * General knowledge questions requiring context\n  * Questions needing interpretation of complex information\n  * Has knowledge cutoff and may not have very recent information\n\n- code_runner: Executes code to fetch real-time data from specific APIs. Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Available Crypto Data Sources:\n    - Binance: Provides cryptocurrency price data for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies\n  * Available Sports Data Sources:\n    - Sports Data IO - MLB (baseball): MLB baseball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NBA (basketball): NBA basketball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NFL (football): NFL football scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NHL (hockey): NHL hockey scores, statistics, and game data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Pistons vs. Knicks, description: In the upcoming NBA game, scheduled for April 21 at 7:30PM ET:\nIf the Detroit Pistons win, the market will resolve to \"Pistons\".\nIf the New York Knicks win, the market will resolve to \"Knicks\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Knicks, p2 to Pistons, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",

Making the code runnable with no arguments\n5. Handling errors gracefully\n6. Returning results in a clear format (either JSON or plaintext with a 'recommendation: X' line)\n\nFor NHL hockey data:\n- Use Sports Data IO API with the SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY from environment variables\n- Use python-dotenv to load the API key:\n  ```python\n  from dotenv import load_dotenv\n  import os\n  \n  load_dotenv()\n  api_key = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\")\n  ```\n- Extract team names and dates from the question\n- The team abbreviations for NHL are:\n  * Seattle Kraken = SEA\n  * Vegas Golden Knights = VGK\n  * Toronto Maple Leafs = TOR\n  * Boston Bruins = BOS\n  * And other standard NHL team abbreviations\n- CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: When defining RESOLUTION_MAP, you MUST use team abbreviations (not full names) as keys:\n  ```python\n  # CORRECT - Use team abbreviations as keys\n  RESOLUTION_MAP = {\n      \"VGK\": \"p1\",  # Golden Knights\n      \"SEA\": \"p2\",  # Kraken\n      \"50-50\": \"p3\",\n      \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\",\n  }\n  \n  # WRONG - Do NOT use full team names as keys\n  # RESOLUTION_MAP = {\n  #     \"Golden Knights\": \"p1\",  # Wrong!

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Pistons vs. Knicks, description: In the upcoming NBA game, scheduled for April 21 at 7:30PM ET:\nIf the Detroit Pistons win, the market will resolve to \"Pistons\".\nIf the New York Knicks win, the market will resolve to \"Knicks\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Knicks, p2 to Pistons, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745288200 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-22 02:16:40 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport logging\n\n# Load environment variables\nload_dotenv()\nNBA_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_NBA_API_KEY\")\n\n# Constants\nRESOLUTION_MAP = {\n    \"DET\": \"p2\",  # Detroit Pistons\n    \"NYK\": \"p1\",  # New York Knicks\n    \"50-50\": \"p3\",\n    \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\",\n}\n\n# Configure logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\nhandler = logging.StreamHandler()\nhandler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nhandler.setFormatter(formatter)\nlogger.addHandler(handler)\n\ndef fetch_nba_game_data():\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches NBA game data for the Pistons vs. Knicks game on the specified date.\n    \"\"\"\n    date = \"2025-04-21\"\n    url = f\"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nba/scores/json/GamesByDate/{date}?key={NBA_API_KEY}\"\n    \n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        games = response.json()\n        \n        for game in games:\n            if game['HomeTeam'] == \"DET\" and game['AwayTeam'] == \"NYK\" or game['HomeTeam'] == \"NYK\" and game['AwayTeam'] == \"DET\":\n                logger.info(f\"Game found: {game['GameId']}\")\n                return game\n        logger.warning(\"No matching game found.\")\n        return None\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Failed to fetch NBA game data: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef determine_resolution(game):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the resolution based on the game's status and outcome.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not game:\n        return \"p4\"  # Too early to resolve\n\n    if game['Status'] == \"Final\":\n        if game['HomeTeam'] == \"DET\" and game['HomeTeamScore'] > game['AwayTeamScore']:\n            return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"DET\"]\n        elif game['AwayTeam'] == \"NYK\" and game['AwayTeamScore'] > game['HomeTeamScore']:\n            return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"NYK\"]\n        else:\n            return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"50-50\"]\n    elif game['Status'] == \"Canceled\":\n        return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"50-50\"]\n    elif game['Status'] == \"Postponed\":\n        return \"p4\"  # Market remains open\n    else:\n        return \"p4\"  # Too early to resolve\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to determine the resolution of the Pistons vs. Knicks game.\n    \"\"\"\n    game_data = fetch_nba_game_data()\n    resolution = determine_resolution(game_data)\n    print(f\"recommendation: {resolution}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p4\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful. Recommendation found: p4.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p4\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Pistons, Price: 0.9995, ID: 20914326476810085365500008253166359748613739610829547613136596895439279020448, Winner: No\n- Token: Knicks, Price: 0.0005, ID: 87959459282671158762245262259135281630810879806900117865287236951099991145772, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Knicks, p2 to Pistons, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Knicks, p2 = Pistons\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Pistons outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Pistons vs. Knicks, description: In the upcoming NBA game, scheduled for April 21 at 7:30PM ET:\nIf the Detroit Pistons win, the market will resolve to \"Pistons\".\nIf the New York Knicks win, the market will resolve to \"Knicks\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Knicks, p2 to Pistons, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745288200 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-22 02:16:40 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport logging\n\n# Load environment variables\nload_dotenv()\nAPI_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_NBA_API_KEY\")\n\n# Constants for resolution mapping\nRESOLUTION_MAP = {\n    \"DET\": \"p2\",  # Detroit Pistons win maps to p2\n    \"NYK\": \"p1\",  # New York Knicks win maps to p1\n    \"50-50\": \"p3\",  # Game canceled or unresolved maps to p3\n    \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\",  # Incomplete data maps to p4\n}\n\n# Configure logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n\ndef fetch_game_result():\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches the result of the NBA game between the Detroit Pistons and the New York Knicks.\n    \"\"\"\n    date = \"2025-04-21\"\n    url = f\"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nba/scores/json/GamesByDate/{date}?key={API_KEY}\"\n    \n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        games = response.json()\n        \n        for game in games:\n            if game['HomeTeam'] == \"DET\" and game['AwayTeam'] == \"NYK\" or game['HomeTeam'] == \"NYK\" and game['AwayTeam'] == \"DET\":\n                if game['Status'] == \"Final\":\n                    home_score = game['HomeTeamScore']\n                    away_score = game['AwayTeamScore']\n                    if home_score > away_score:\n                        winner = game['HomeTeam']\n                    else:\n                        winner = game['AwayTeam']\n                    \n                    return RESOLUTION_MAP.get(winner, \"p4\")\n                elif game['Status'] == \"Canceled\":\n                    return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"50-50\"]\n                elif game['Status'] in [\"Scheduled\", \"InProgress\", \"Delayed\", \"Postponed\"]:\n                    return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"Too early to resolve\"]\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        logging.error(f\"Failed to fetch game data: {e}\")\n        return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"Too early to resolve\"]\n\n    return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"Too early to resolve\"]\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to determine the resolution of the NBA game market.\n    \"\"\"\n    resolution = fetch_game_result()\n    print(f\"recommendation: {resolution}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p4\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745288200 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-22 02:16:40 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4.

Where p1 corresponds to Knicks, p2 to Pistons, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Knicks, p2 = Pistons\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Pistons outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The key here is to determine who won that game using the provided search results.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The system says it's April 22, 2025, so the game in question was yesterday. That means the event has already occurred, and I need to find the result.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the game. Result [3] is an article titled \"Knicks use a 21-0 run in the 4th quarter to beat the Pistons 123-112 in Game 1\" from April 21, 2025. That's a clear indication the Knicks won Game 1. But wait, the user's query is about the game on April 21 at 7:30 PM ET. Wait, Game 1 was on April 19, according to result [1], which is an ESPN page from April 19, 2025, covering the Pistons vs. Knicks game. Then result [3] and [4] talk about Game 1 on April 19, where the Knicks won 123-112.\n\nBut the user is asking about the game on April 21. Let me check the other results. Result [2] is a YouTube video titled \"New York Knicks vs. Detroit Pistons GAME 2 Full Highlights 2nd Qtr | Apr 21 | 2025...\" uploaded on April 22, 2025. The description mentions it's Game 2. Similarly, result [5] is another YouTube video for Game 2 highlights on April 21. Result [9] is a prediction for Game 2 on April 21, 2025, and result [10] is a prediction for the same date. Result [12] mentions the Knicks won Game 1 123-114 (slight discrepancy in score) and discusses Game 2 on April 21. Result [14] is an injury report for the April 21 game, and result [15] is a prediction for Game 2.\n\nWait, there's confusion here. The user's query mentions the game scheduled for April 21 at 7:30 PM ET. But some sources refer to Game 1 on April 19, and others to Game 2 on April 21. The ancillary data in the query refers to the upcoming game on April 21, which would be Game 2 of the series. However, the search results include both Game 1 and Game 2. \n\nLooking deeper, result [11] is a matchup page on thescore.com for the Pistons vs. Knicks game on April 21, 2025, stating that the Knicks lead the series 1-0. Result [12] from NBC Sports mentions that the Knicks won Game 1 and discusses Game 2 on April 21. Result [13] is a prediction for Game 2 on April 21. Result [14] talks about Game 2 and the Pistons' need to bounce back after losing Game 1. Result [15] also discusses Game 2 predictions.\n\nBut where is the actual result of the April 21 game? The search results include YouTube highlights for Game 2. Result [2] and [5] are highlights from the second quarter of Game 2. The transcripts mention specific players and actions during the game. For example, result [2] describes the Pistons having a 10-point lead in the second quarter, but the Knicks making a comeback. However, without the final score in these highlights, it's challenging to determine the outcome.\n\nResult [10] is a prediction article from April 21, 2025, which mentions the previous game (Game 1) and anticipates Game 2. Similarly, result [9] is a prediction for Game 2, not the result. Result [14] is an injury report for Game 2 but doesn't provide the score.\n\nWait, result [1] is an ESPN live score page for the Pistons vs. Knicks game on April 21, 2025. The URL is from April 19, but the page title says \"Pistons vs. Knicks (Apr 21, 2025) Live Score - ESPN\". The content shows the Knicks with 94 points and the Pistons with 8.0, but that seems incomplete. The tables list player stats, but the final score isn't clearly stated. The live score might have been captured during the game, not the final result.\n\nLooking at result [2] and [5], which are YouTube highlights, the transcripts describe the second quarter of Game 2. For example, in result [2], the Pistons had a 10-point lead, but the Knicks were making a comeback. The video's upload date is April 22, 2025, which is after the game. However, without the final score in the transcript, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, result [10] is a prediction article from April 21, 2025, which states that the Knicks won Game 1 and are leading the series. It doesn't mention Game 2's result. Similarly, result [12] from NBC Sports, dated April 21, discusses Game 2 but doesn't provide the score. The same with result [13] and [15], which are predictions.\n\nThe key here is that the user's query is about the game on April 21, which is Game 2. The search results include highlights and discussions about Game 2 but don't explicitly state the final score. However, the YouTube videos (results [2] and [5]) are titled as Game 2 highlights, uploaded on April 22, indicating the game occurred. The absence of a clear final score in the provided search results is a problem.\n\nBut wait, the user's personalization instructions say that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable information is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. However, the instructions also state that if the event is in the past and no info is found, default to p4. But in this case, there are search results about the game, but they don't clearly state the outcome.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Knicks won Game 2 as well. But without explicit confirmation, it's risky. However, looking at result [2], the transcript mentions the Knicks making a comeback in the second quarter. If the game was on April 21 and the current date is April 22, the system should have access to the result. However, the provided search results don't include a post-game article with the final score.\n\nGiven the ancillary data, the resolution is p1 for Knicks, p2 for Pistons. If the game was played and the Knicks won, it's p1. If the Pistons won, p2. If no info, p4. But the user's instructions say that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The conditions in the ancillary data say if the game is canceled, resolve to p3 (50-50), but the game wasn't canceled.\n\nGiven that the Knicks were the higher seed and won Game 1, and the search results mention their strong performance, it's possible they won Game 2. However, without explicit confirmation, this is speculative. However, the YouTube highlights (results [2] and [5]) might imply the game was played, but the outcome isn't clear.\n\nWait, result [10] is a prediction for Game 2 on April 21, which says the Knicks are favored. But predictions aren't results. The user's instructions state to rely on verified facts. Since the search results don't provide a clear final score for the April 21 game, despite multiple sources discussing it, perhaps the information is missing. In that case, according to the personalization instructions, if no verifiable info is available and the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The Knicks were the higher seed and won Game 1, so it's probable they won Game 2 as well. Therefore, the resolution would be p1 (Knicks). However, this is an assumption, which might not be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game was postponed or canceled. But the search results don't mention that. The ancillary data says if postponed, the market remains open, but the current date is after the event, so it should have been played. Therefore, the most probable outcome is Knicks win, hence p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Where p1 corresponds to Knicks, p2 to Pistons, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Knicks, p2 = Pistons\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Pistons outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3.

The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the outcome of the Pistons vs. Knicks game on April 21, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Knicks win, it's p1 (Knicks), Pistons win p2 (Pistons), postponed remains open, and canceled resolves to 50-50 (p3). The current timestamp is April 22, 2025, 2:16:40 UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as planned. The search results include several sources. Let's look at the ESPN score (result 9) which shows the final score as Pistons 97, Knicks 94. That's a Pistons win. However, the user mentioned that a previous response returned p1 (Knicks), so they want a recheck. \n\nWait, there's a discrepancy here. The initial game on April 19 was a Knicks win (123-112, results 1,3,5,6). The game on April 21 is Game 2. The query is about the April 21 game. Let me confirm the dates. The user's query mentions the game scheduled for April 21 at 7:30 PM ET. The current date is April 22, so the game has already taken place.\n\nLooking at result 9 (ESPN), the live score shows Pistons 97, Knicks 94. That's a Pistons victory. Result 10 is a YouTube live stream mentioning the Knicks taking a 1-0 series lead, but that's about Game 1. Result 11 (Predictem) discusses Game 2, noting the Pistons lost Game 1 and the analysis for Game 2. Result 12 (Times of India) states the Pistons are looking to bounce back in Game 2, and result 14 (theScore) shows the final score of Game 2 as Pistons 97, Knicks 94. \n\nAdditionally, result 15 (Finger Lakes) confirms the Game 2 date and time, and result 10's YouTube description mentions the Knicks leading the series 1-0 before Game 2. The ESPN score (result 9) is the most direct evidence of the Game 2 outcome: Pistons won 97-94. \n\nTherefore, despite the initial response being p1 (Knicks win in Game 1), the correct resolution for the April 21 game is p2 (Pistons). The user's ancillary data maps Pistons win to p2. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, so the resolution is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Where p1 corresponds to Knicks, p2 to Pistons, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745288200 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-22 02:16:40 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p1. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query.

The user's ancillary data maps Pistons win to p2. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, so the resolution is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Pistons, Price: 0.9995, ID: 20914326476810085365500008253166359748613739610829547613136596895439279020448, Winner: No\n- Token: Knicks, Price: 0.0005, ID: 87959459282671158762245262259135281630810879806900117865287236951099991145772, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Knicks, p2 to Pistons, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Knicks, p2 = Pistons\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Pistons outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.
