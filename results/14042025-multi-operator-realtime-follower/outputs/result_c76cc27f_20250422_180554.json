      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say the word \"egg\" during her next White House press briefing. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if she does, \"No\" (p1) if she doesn't, and \"p3\" if it's uncertain. The key here is to check if the press briefing scheduled for April 22, 2025, at 1 PM ET has already happened and whether she used the word \"egg\" during it.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the current date and time. The user provided the current Unix timestamp as 1745344910, which converts to April 22, 2025, 18:01:50 UTC. The press briefing was scheduled for 1 PM ET on April 22, which is 17:00 UTC. So, the briefing occurred about an hour before the current time. That means the event has already taken place.\n\nNext, I need to check the search results for any transcripts or mentions of the April 22 briefing. The search results include several live streams and news articles about the briefing, but the actual content of the briefing isn't detailed in the provided context. However, looking at the search results, there's a mention of a press briefing on April 22, 2025, by Karoline Leavitt, but no direct quotes or transcripts from that specific event. \n\nThe user's ancillary data specifies that any usage of \"egg\" in any context counts, including plural or possessive forms. Past briefings (like on January 28, March 11, and April 8, 2025) show that Leavitt frequently discussed egg prices and shortages, often blaming the Biden administration. For example, in the March 11 briefing, she mentioned egg prices and a plan to address the supply. On April 8, she noted that egg prices were down. Given her history of discussing egg-related issues, it's plausible she mentioned \"egg\" again in the April 22 briefing.\n\nHowever, without the actual transcript or video of the April 22 briefing, I can't confirm definitively. The search results include a scheduled briefing (result 15 and 16) but no content. The user's personalization instructions say to resolve based on verifiable facts. Since the event has occurred but there's no available evidence from the provided sources that she said \"egg,\" the safest resolution is p1 (No) due to lack of confirmation. But considering her pattern, there's a chance she did mention it. However, per the rules, without explicit evidence, I should default to p4 if uncertain. Wait, the resolution conditions here are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 50-50. The user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. Given her history, it's probable she mentioned \"egg,\" but without proof, the correct resolution is p4? Wait, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, resolve based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions. The ancillary data says if no briefing happens by Dec 31, resolve to No. The briefing did happen, so that's not the case. Since the event occurred, but no sources confirm \"egg\" was said, but given her history, it's likely. However, the user's instructions say to resolve based on verifiable sources. Since none of the provided search results from the April 22 briefing include the word \"egg,\" I have to go with the available info. Therefore, the resolution should be p1 (No) because there's no evidence she said it, despite her past mentions. But wait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable based on her history is that she did mention \"egg,\" but without explicit evidence, the rules say to default to p4? Wait, the resolution conditions don't include p4. The ancillary data has p1, p2, p3. The user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. So if I can infer from past behavior that she likely mentioned \"egg,\" then p2 (Yes). But the user's instructions also say to use the provided sources. The provided sources don't have the transcript from April 22, so I can't confirm. Therefore, under the rules, if no verifiable info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. Given her frequent discussion of eggs, it's probable she mentioned it. But the user's instructions say to answer based on the provided search results. Since the search results don't include the April 22 transcript, I can't confirm. Therefore, the answer should be p1 (No) because there's no evidence in the provided sources. Alternatively, if the user's personalization allows assuming based on past behavior, then p2. But the strict rule is to use only provided sources. Since the April 22 briefing isn't covered in the sources, I have to resolve as p1. Wait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable here, given her history, is that she mentioned \"egg.\" Therefore, the resolution should be p2 (Yes). But I need to check the exact instructions again. The personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" So, since the event happened, and there's no info, but her past behavior shows she often discusses eggs, the most probable outcome is Yes (p2). Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745344910 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-22 18:01:50 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say the word \"egg\" during her next White House press briefing. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if she does, \"No\" (p1) if she doesn't, and \"p3\" if it's uncertain. The key here is to check if the press briefing scheduled for April 22, 2025, at 1 PM ET has already happened and whether she used the word \"egg\" during it.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the current date and time. The user provided the current Unix timestamp as 1745344910, which converts to April 22, 2025, 18:01:50 UTC. The press briefing was scheduled for 1 PM ET on April 22, which is 17:00 UTC. So, the briefing occurred about an hour before the current time. That means the event has already taken place.\n\nNext, I need to check the search results for any transcripts or mentions of the April 22 briefing. The search results include several live streams and news articles about the briefing, but the actual content of the briefing isn't detailed in the provided context. However, looking at the search results, there's a mention of a press briefing on April 22, 2025, by Karoline Leavitt, but no direct quotes or transcripts from that specific event. \n\nThe user's ancillary data specifies that any usage of \"egg\" in any context counts, including plural or possessive forms. Past briefings (like on January 28, March 11, and April 8, 2025) show that Leavitt frequently discussed egg prices and shortages, often blaming the Biden administration. For example, in the March 11 briefing, she mentioned egg prices and a plan to address the supply. On April 8, she noted that egg prices were down. Given her history of discussing egg-related issues, it's plausible she mentioned \"egg\" again in the April 22 briefing.\n\nHowever, without the actual transcript or video of the April 22 briefing, I can't confirm definitively. The search results include a scheduled briefing (result 15 and 16) but no content. The user's personalization instructions say to resolve based on verifiable facts. Since the event has occurred but there's no available evidence from the provided sources that she said \"egg,\" the safest resolution is p1 (No) due to lack of confirmation. But considering her pattern, there's a chance she did mention it. However, per the rules, without explicit evidence, I should default to p4 if uncertain. Wait, the resolution conditions here are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 50-50. The user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. Given her history, it's probable she mentioned \"egg,\" but without proof, the correct resolution is p4? Wait, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, resolve based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions. The ancillary data says if no briefing happens by Dec 31, resolve to No. The briefing did happen, so that's not the case. Since the event occurred, but no sources confirm \"egg\" was said, but given her history, it's likely. However, the user's instructions say to resolve based on verifiable sources. Since none of the provided search results from the April 22 briefing include the word \"egg,\" I have to go with the available info. Therefore, the resolution should be p1 (No) because there's no evidence she said it, despite her past mentions. But wait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable based on her history is that she did mention \"egg,\" but without explicit evidence, the rules say to default to p4? Wait, the resolution conditions don't include p4. The ancillary data has p1, p2, p3. The user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. So if I can infer from past behavior that she likely mentioned \"egg,\" then p2 (Yes). But the user's instructions also say to use the provided sources. The provided sources don't have the transcript from April 22, so I can't confirm. Therefore, under the rules, if no verifiable info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. Given her frequent discussion of eggs, it's probable she mentioned it. But the user's instructions say to answer based on the provided search results. Since the search results don't include the April 22 transcript, I can't confirm. Therefore, the answer should be p1 (No) because there's no evidence in the provided sources. Alternatively, if the user's personalization allows assuming based on past behavior, then p2. But the strict rule is to use only provided sources. Since the April 22 briefing isn't covered in the sources, I have to resolve as p1. Wait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable here, given her history, is that she mentioned \"egg.\" Therefore, the resolution should be p2 (Yes). But I need to check the exact instructions again. The personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" So, since the event happened, and there's no info, but her past behavior shows she often discusses eggs, the most probable outcome is Yes (p2). Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.275, ID: 44704680499883053181082731575665992355589608288961655627142096492888702970984, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.725, ID: 105769312626701618518175943448608548769471802069081118860336301897994133817551, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say the word \"egg\" during her next White House press briefing. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for unknown. The current date is April 22, 2025, and the briefing in question is today's, which has already taken place based on the search results.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there was a press briefing today. The search results [1], [2], [3], [4], and [8] all mention that Karoline Leavitt held a press briefing on April 22, 2025. So the event has occurred.\n\nNext, I need to verify if she said \"egg\" during this briefing. The search results provided include transcripts and articles from previous briefings where egg prices were a topic, such as [10], [11], [13], [15], and [16]. However, the specific briefing on April 22 isn't fully transcribed in the provided data. \n\nLooking at the available information, the most recent briefings mentioned are from March and January 2025, where egg prices were discussed. For example, in the March 5 briefing [16], Leavitt addressed the egg crisis and mentioned efforts to increase supply. However, today's briefing might have covered different topics. \n\nThe search result [4] from PBS mentions that during the April 22 briefing, Hegseth's use of Signal chats was discussed, but there's no mention of eggs. Similarly, [8] includes a partial transcript where trade negotiations and other topics were discussed, but no direct mention of \"egg.\" \n\nSince the user requires the term \"egg\" to be spoken by Leavitt, and the available transcripts from today's briefing don't include that word, it's likely she didn't say it. However, without the full transcript or video, there's some uncertainty. But according to the user's instructions, if no verifiable evidence exists, we should recommend p4 (unknown). However, the resolution conditions here are p1, p2, p3. Wait, the ancillary data says p3 is 0.5, but the user's personalization says to recommend p4 if unknown. Wait, the personalization says to end with recommendation: p1, p2, p3, or p4. But the resolution_conditions in the query have p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 50-50. However, the user's additional instruction says if no verifiable evidence exists, recommend p4. But the market resolution conditions don't include p4. Wait, the query's resolution_conditions are p1:0, p2:1, p3:0.5. The user's personalization says to recommend p4 if unknown. But the market's resolution doesn't have p4. This is conflicting. Wait, looking back, the user's query includes resolution_conditions where p3 is 0.5 (unknown/50-50). However, the personalization says to recommend p4 if no evidence. But the market's resolution options are p1, p2, p3. So perhaps the user made a mistake, but according to the instructions, if no verifiable evidence, recommend p4. But the market doesn't have p4.

Therefore, if there's no evidence, the answer should be p3. But the personalization says to recommend p4 if no evidence. But the market doesn't have p4. This is a conflict. However, the user's personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome... resolve the query based on the most probable outcome... otherwise default to p4.\" But the market's options are p1, p2, p3. Therefore, perhaps p3 is the correct choice here. However, since the event has occurred, and the available data doesn't show her saying \"egg,\" but we don't have the full transcript, it's possible she didn't. However, without the full video, we can't be certain. Therefore, the recommendation would be p3 (unknown) if we can't verify, but the user's instruction says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable outcome, given that previous briefings discussed eggs but today's didn't (based on available info), is that she didn't say it. Therefore, recommend p1 (No). But need to check again. The search results for today's briefing don't mention eggs. The partial transcript in [8] talks about trade deals, not eggs. Therefore, it's likely she didn't say \"egg.\" So the answer is p1 (No).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say the word \"egg\" during her next White House press briefing. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for unknown. The current date is April 22, 2025, and the briefing in question is today's, which has already taken place based on the search results.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there was a press briefing today. The search results [1], [2], [3], [4], and [8] all mention that Karoline Leavitt held a press briefing on April 22, 2025. So the event has occurred.\n\nNext, I need to verify if she said \"egg\" during this briefing. The search results provided include transcripts and articles from previous briefings where egg prices were a topic, such as [10], [11], [13], [15], and [16]. However, the specific briefing on April 22 isn't fully transcribed in the provided data. \n\nLooking at the available information, the most recent briefings mentioned are from March and January 2025, where egg prices were discussed. For example, in the March 5 briefing [16], Leavitt addressed the egg crisis and mentioned efforts to increase supply. However, today's briefing might have covered different topics. \n\nThe search result [4] from PBS mentions that during the April 22 briefing, Hegseth's use of Signal chats was discussed, but there's no mention of eggs. Similarly, [8] includes a partial transcript where trade negotiations and other topics were discussed, but no direct mention of \"egg.\" \n\nSince the user requires the term \"egg\" to be spoken by Leavitt, and the available transcripts from today's briefing don't include that word, it's likely she didn't say it. However, without the full transcript or video, there's some uncertainty. But according to the user's instructions, if no verifiable evidence exists, we should recommend p4 (unknown). However, the resolution conditions here are p1, p2, p3. Wait, the ancillary data says p3 is 0.5, but the user's personalization says to recommend p4 if unknown. Wait, the personalization says to end with recommendation: p1, p2, p3, or p4. But the resolution_conditions in the query have p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 50-50. However, the user's additional instruction says if no verifiable evidence exists, recommend p4. But the market resolution conditions don't include p4. Wait, the query's resolution_conditions are p1:0, p2:1, p3:0.5. The user's personalization says to recommend p4 if unknown. But the market's resolution doesn't have p4. This is conflicting. Wait, looking back, the user's query includes resolution_conditions where p3 is 0.5 (unknown/50-50). However, the personalization says to recommend p4 if no evidence. But the market's resolution options are p1, p2, p3. So perhaps the user made a mistake, but according to the instructions, if no verifiable evidence, recommend p4. But the market doesn't have p4. This is confusing. Wait, the user's query says: \"resolution_conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\" So p3 is the unknown option. Therefore, if there's no evidence, the answer should be p3. But the personalization says to recommend p4 if no evidence. But the market doesn't have p4. This is a conflict. However, the user's personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome... resolve the query based on the most probable outcome... otherwise default to p4.\" But the market's options are p1, p2, p3. Therefore, perhaps p3 is the correct choice here. However, since the event has occurred, and the available data doesn't show her saying \"egg,\" but we don't have the full transcript, it's possible she didn't. However, without the full video, we can't be certain. Therefore, the recommendation would be p3 (unknown) if we can't verify, but the user's instruction says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable outcome, given that previous briefings discussed eggs but today's didn't (based on available info), is that she didn't say it. Therefore, recommend p1 (No). But need to check again. The search results for today's briefing don't mention eggs. The partial transcript in [8] talks about trade deals, not eggs. Therefore, it's likely she didn't say \"egg.\" So the answer is p1 (No).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.275, ID: 44704680499883053181082731575665992355589608288961655627142096492888702970984, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.725, ID: 105769312626701618518175943448608548769471802069081118860336301897994133817551, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors NO outcome (0.725 = 72.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
