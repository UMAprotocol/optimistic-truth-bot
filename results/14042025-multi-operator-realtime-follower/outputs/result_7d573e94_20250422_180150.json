      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"President\" 70 or more times during her next White House press briefing. The resolution conditions are p2 for Yes, p1 for No, and p3 if it's uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check if there's an upcoming press briefing scheduled before December 31, 2025. The current date is April 22, 2025. The user mentioned that if no briefing happens by the end of 2025, it resolves to No. But since we're in April, there's still time for briefings to occur. However, the next briefing isn't specified in the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, the latest briefing mentioned is from March 26, 2025 [13]. There's no information about future briefings. The user's query is about the \"next\" briefing, which hasn't happened yet. Since the current date is April 22, 2025, and the next briefing's date isn't provided, we can't analyze it directly. \n\nThe user also specified that if Leavitt ceases to be Press Secretary before the deadline, it resolves to No. The search results indicate she's the current Press Secretary as of January 2025 [1][2][4][6][9][11][14][15], with no mention of her leaving the position. So, she's still in office as of the current date.\n\nNow, to determine the likelihood of her saying \"President\" 70+ times. Looking at past briefings, in her January 29, 2025 briefing [4], she referred to Trump as \"President Trump\" multiple times. For example, she said, \"thanks to President Trump\" and \"the president is confident\" [4]. In the March 26 briefing transcript [13], she uses \"President\" several times, like \"the President's view\" and \"the president has ensured\" [13]. However, counting exact instances isn't possible without full transcripts, but the usage seems frequent but not excessively so.\n\nIn her CPAC speech [12], she frequently mentions \"President Trump,\" but that's a different context. Press briefings might have a different pattern. The February 20 briefing [6] also shows her referring to the president, but again, exact counts aren't available. \n\nConsidering her role, she's likely to mention \"President\" often when discussing Trump's policies and actions. However, reaching 70 instances in a single briefing seems high. Typical briefings might have a few dozen mentions, but 70 is quite a lot. Without evidence of her hitting that number in past briefings, it's speculative. \n\nAdditionally, the user's condition includes any form of the term, including possessive and plural, but not other forms. If the briefing is lengthy, maybe, but 70 is a high threshold. Since there's no data confirming she's reached that count before, and the next briefing's content is unknown, it's uncertain. However, the market resolves to No if the event doesn't occur by the deadline. Since the next briefing hasn't happened yet and we can't predict her exact wording, the safest resolution is p4 (cannot resolve now) if the event is in the future. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the future, return p4. Wait, the current timestamp is April 22, 2025. The next briefing is after this date, so it's a future event. Therefore, per the instructions, if the event is scheduled for a future date, resolve to p4.

The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"President\" 70 or more times during her next White House press briefing. The resolution conditions are p2 for Yes, p1 for No, and p3 if it's uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check if there's an upcoming press briefing scheduled before December 31, 2025. The current date is April 22, 2025. The user mentioned that if no briefing happens by the end of 2025, it resolves to No. But since we're in April, there's still time for briefings to occur. However, the next briefing isn't specified in the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, the latest briefing mentioned is from March 26, 2025 [13]. There's no information about future briefings. The user's query is about the \"next\" briefing, which hasn't happened yet. Since the current date is April 22, 2025, and the next briefing's date isn't provided, we can't analyze it directly. \n\nThe user also specified that if Leavitt ceases to be Press Secretary before the deadline, it resolves to No. The search results indicate she's the current Press Secretary as of January 2025 [1][2][4][6][9][11][14][15], with no mention of her leaving the position. So, she's still in office as of the current date.\n\nNow, to determine the likelihood of her saying \"President\" 70+ times. Looking at past briefings, in her January 29, 2025 briefing [4], she referred to Trump as \"President Trump\" multiple times. For example, she said, \"thanks to President Trump\" and \"the president is confident\" [4]. In the March 26 briefing transcript [13], she uses \"President\" several times, like \"the President's view\" and \"the president has ensured\" [13]. However, counting exact instances isn't possible without full transcripts, but the usage seems frequent but not excessively so.\n\nIn her CPAC speech [12], she frequently mentions \"President Trump,\" but that's a different context. Press briefings might have a different pattern. The February 20 briefing [6] also shows her referring to the president, but again, exact counts aren't available. \n\nConsidering her role, she's likely to mention \"President\" often when discussing Trump's policies and actions. However, reaching 70 instances in a single briefing seems high. Typical briefings might have a few dozen mentions, but 70 is quite a lot. Without evidence of her hitting that number in past briefings, it's speculative. \n\nAdditionally, the user's condition includes any form of the term, including possessive and plural, but not other forms. If the briefing is lengthy, maybe, but 70 is a high threshold. Since there's no data confirming she's reached that count before, and the next briefing's content is unknown, it's uncertain. However, the market resolves to No if the event doesn't occur by the deadline. Since the next briefing hasn't happened yet and we can't predict her exact wording, the safest resolution is p4 (cannot resolve now) if the event is in the future. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the future, return p4. Wait, the current timestamp is April 22, 2025. The next briefing is after this date, so it's a future event. Therefore, per the instructions, if the event is scheduled for a future date, resolve to p4. But the user's query says if the event hasn't happened by Dec 31, 2025, resolve to No. However, the event is the next briefing, which is in the future relative to now. Since we don't know when the next briefing is, but it's possible it could happen before the deadline, but as of now, it's a future event. Therefore, according to the personalization rules, if the event is in the future, return p4. But the user's ancillary data says if no briefing happens by Dec 31, resolve to No. But since the event is the next briefing, which is a future event, and we can't confirm it yet, the correct resolution is p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the future, return p4. So the answer should be p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.67, ID: 33880922183106126965816933892129427946403550866741169220092254277490414183855, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.33, ID: 58550631692230744194606806372326423205137969276482760105140784163690795844993, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 if it's uncertain. The current date is April 22, 2025, and the briefing in question is the next one she participates in. If she doesn't hold a briefing by December 31, 2025, or if she's no longer Press Secretary by then, it resolves to No.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's any information about upcoming briefings. The search results mention a briefing on April 22, 2025, which is today. The video from Sky News [8] covers a briefing held today. The transcript isn't provided, but the video is the resolution source. Since the user provided a transcript of a previous briefing on February 5, 2025 [15], but the latest is today's, I need to focus on that.\n\nLooking at past briefings, Leavitt often refers to \"President Trump\" frequently. For example, in the January 28, 2025 briefing [3], she mentions \"President Trump\" multiple times. In the February 20 briefing [6], she uses \"President Trump\" repeatedly. The transcript from CPAC [12] shows her using \"President\" often when discussing Trump's policies. \n\nTo estimate if she hits 70 mentions, I can look at previous briefings. The January 28 transcript [3] has her saying \"President Trump\" about 10 times in the provided excerpt. The February 20 briefing [6] has her mentioning \"President\" over 20 times in the transcript snippet. If a full briefing is longer, say 30-60 minutes, the count could be higher. However, reaching 70 instances seems high unless she's using the term in every other sentence.\n\nAnother angle: the structure of her briefings. She often starts with President Trump's achievements, mentions his actions, and answers questions about his policies. Each time she refers to him, it's likely \"President Trump.\" In a 60-minute briefing with 30 questions, if each answer includes \"President\" 2-3 times, that could add up. But 70 is 1.16 times per minute, which is possible but depends on the briefing's length and content.\n\nThe April 22 briefing [8] is the key here. Without the transcript, I have to rely on the video. Since the user's resolution source is the video, and the market resolves based on that, I need to check if the video shows her saying \"President\" 70+ times. However, the provided search results don't include the transcript for April 22. The Sky News link [8] is a video, which I can't access directly. \n\nGiven the user's instructions, if the event date (April 22) is in the past and no verifiable outcome is provided, I should assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. Since Leavitt's pattern shows frequent use of \"President,\" but 70 is a high threshold, it's possible but uncertain. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. Since the event happened today and there's no transcript, but her historical data doesn't reach 70, it's more likely under 70. But without concrete evidence, it's a close call. However, the user's instruction says if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. Given that, and considering the high number 70, I'd lean towards No (p1). But wait, the user's personalization also says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. Since the event occurred today, and there's no data, but her past briefings didn't hit 70, it's safer to resolve to No. However, if the briefing was particularly long or focused on the President's actions, maybe she did. But without evidence, the default is No. So recommendation: p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745344193 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-22 17:49:53 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745344193 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-22 17:49:53 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please ensure access to the video or transcript from the April 22 briefing to verify the exact number of times 'President' was mentioned. This direct evidence is crucial for an accurate resolution.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"President\" 70 or more times during her next White House press briefing. The resolution depends on counting each instance of the term \"President\" (including plural and possessive forms) during the briefing. If she doesn't hold a briefing by the end of 2025 or leaves her position, it resolves to \"No\". \n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a scheduled press briefing. The current date is April 22, 2025. The user mentioned that briefings are typically on weekdays between 12 PM and 3 PM ET. Since today is a Tuesday, and the time is 6:01 PM UTC (which is 2:01 PM ET), the briefing for today would have already occurred if it was scheduled. \n\nLooking at the search results, the latest briefing transcript provided is from April 16, 2025 [13], and there's no mention of a briefing on April 22.

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors YES outcome (0.670 = 67.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

The response also correctly navigates through the complexities of the query's conditions and the ancillary data provided.",
