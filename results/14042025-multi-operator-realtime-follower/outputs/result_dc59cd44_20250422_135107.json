Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",

DO NOT use command-line arguments. Extract all necessary information from the question itself.\n2. Load environment variables from .env files using the python-dotenv package.\n3. For API keys, use the following environment variables:\n   - BINANCE_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_NBA_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_NFL_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\n\n4. Available Data Sources Information:\n   ALL AVAILABLE API CONFIGURATIONS:\n   - Binance (Category: crypto):\n     * API Key: BINANCE_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.binance.com/api/v3\n     * proxy endpoint: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\n   - Sports Data IO - MLB (Category: sports, Subcategory: baseball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb\n   - Sports Data IO - NBA (Category: sports, Subcategory: basketball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NBA_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nba\n   - Sports Data IO - NFL (Category: sports, Subcategory: football):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NFL_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nfl\n   - Sports Data IO - NHL (Category: sports, Subcategory: hockey):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nhl\n\n5. Query Type Specific Information:\n\n   Cryptocurrency Data Sources:\n   - Binance:\n     * primary: https://api.binance.com/api/v3\n     * proxy: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\n     * RECOMMENDED: Use this proxy endpoint first for better reliability\n     * Example: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy?symbol=BTCUSDT&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime=TIMESTAMP&endTime=TIMESTAMP\n\n     * CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Since a proxy endpoint is provided, you MUST implement a fallback mechanism:\n       1. Try the proxy endpoint first (better reliability)\n       2. If proxy fails (timeout, error response, etc.), automatically fall back to the primary endpoint\n       3. Your code MUST handle this gracefully with try/except blocks\n\n     Example fallback code structure:\n     ```python\n     def get_data(symbol, start_time, end_time):\n         try:\n             # First try the proxy endpoint\n             response = requests.get(f\"{proxy_url}?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n         except Exception as e:\n             print(f\"Proxy endpoint failed: {str(e)}, falling back to primary endpoint\")\n             # Fall back to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n             response = requests.get(f\"{primary_url}/klines?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n     ```\n     \n6. NEVER include actual API key values in the code, always load them from environment variables.\n\n7. IMPORTANT FOR ALL DATA SOURCES: If a proxy endpoint is provided alongside a primary endpoint, you MUST implement the fallback mechanism described above. This is critical for reliability:\n   - Always try the proxy endpoint first\n   - If the proxy fails, fall back to the primary endpoint\n   - Use appropriate timeout values (10 seconds recommended)\n   - Include proper error handling with try/except blocks\n\nThe code should be completely self-contained and runnable with no arguments.\n\n\nHere's a complete code example that shows how to solve this type of problem:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Note: Binance public API doesn't require an API key for basic price queries\n# However, if we need rate limits increased or private endpoints, we would use these:\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\nBINANCE_API_SECRET = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\")\n\n# Sensitive data patterns to mask in logs\nSENSITIVE_PATTERNS = [\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_KEY\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    #

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Will Bitcoin reach $90k in April?, description: This market will immediately resolve to \"Yes\" if any Binance 1 minute candle for Bitcoin (BTCUSDT) between April 1, 2025, 00:00 and April 30, 2025, 23:59 in the ET timezone has a final \"High\" price of $90,000 or higher. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No.\"\n\nThe resolution source for this market is Binance, specifically the BTCUSDT \"High\" prices available at https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT, with the chart settings on \"1m\" for one-minute candles selected on the top bar.\n\nPlease note that the outcome of this market depends solely on the price data from the Binance BTCUSDT trading pair. Prices from other exchanges, different trading pairs, or spot markets will not be considered for the resolution of this market.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745329377 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-22 13:42:57 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport os\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# API keys loaded from environment variables\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\n\n# API endpoints\nPRIMARY_API_URL = \"https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines\"\nPROXY_API_URL = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\"\n\ndef fetch_data_from_binance(symbol, interval, start_time, end_time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches data from Binance API with a fallback to a proxy server if the primary fails.\n    \"\"\"\n    params = {\n        \"symbol\": symbol,\n        \"interval\": interval,\n        \"startTime\": start_time,\n        \"endTime\": end_time,\n        \"limit\": 1000  # Adjust based on the maximum expected data points\n    }\n\n    try:\n        # Try fetching data from the proxy endpoint first\n        response = requests.get(PROXY_API_URL, params=params, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n        if data:\n            return data\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Proxy endpoint failed: {str(e)}, falling back to primary endpoint\")\n        # Fall back to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n        try:\n            response = requests.get(PRIMARY_API_URL, params=params, timeout=10)\n            response.raise_for_status()\n            data = response.json()\n            if data:\n                return data\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"Primary endpoint also failed: {str(e)}\")\n            return None\n\ndef check_bitcoin_price_threshold(start_date, end_date, threshold):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if Bitcoin price reached a certain threshold within a given date range.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert dates to timestamps\n    tz = pytz.timezone(\"US/Eastern\")\n    start_dt = tz.localize(datetime.strptime(start_date, \"%Y-%m-%d\"))\n    end_dt = tz.localize(datetime.strptime(end_date, \"%Y-%m-%d\") + timedelta(days=1))\n\n    start_ts = int(start_dt.timestamp() * 1000)\n    end_ts = int(end_dt.timestamp() * 1000)\n\n    # Fetch data\n    data = fetch_data_from_binance(\"BTCUSDT\", \"1m\", start_ts, end_ts)\n\n    if data:\n        for candle in data:\n            high_price = float(candle[2])  # High price is the third element in the list\n            if high_price >= threshold:\n                return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    # Define the date range and price threshold\n    start_date = \"2025-04-01\"\n    end_date = \"2025-04-30\"\n    price_threshold = 90000\n\n    # Check if the price threshold was reached\n    result = check_bitcoin_price_threshold(start_date, end_date, price_threshold)\n\n    # Print the result based on the outcome\n    if result:\n        print(\"recommendation: p2\")  # Yes, Bitcoin reached $90k\n    else:\n        print(\"recommendation: p1\")  # No, Bitcoin did not reach $90k\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p1\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.950 = 95.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

For API keys, use the following environment variables:\n   - BINANCE_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_NBA_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_NFL_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\n\n4. Available Data Sources Information:\n   ALL AVAILABLE API CONFIGURATIONS:\n   - Binance (Category: crypto):\n     * API Key: BINANCE_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.binance.com/api/v3\n     * proxy endpoint: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\n   - Sports Data IO - MLB (Category: sports, Subcategory: baseball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb\n   - Sports Data IO - NBA (Category: sports, Subcategory: basketball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NBA_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nba\n   - Sports Data IO - NFL (Category: sports, Subcategory: football):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NFL_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nfl\n   - Sports Data IO - NHL (Category: sports, Subcategory: hockey):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nhl\n\n5. Query Type Specific Information:\n\n   Cryptocurrency Data Sources:\n   - Binance:\n     * primary: https://api.binance.com/api/v3\n     * proxy: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\n     * RECOMMENDED: Use this proxy endpoint first for better reliability\n     * Example: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy?symbol=BTCUSDT&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime=TIMESTAMP&endTime=TIMESTAMP\n\n     * CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Since a proxy endpoint is provided, you MUST implement a fallback mechanism:\n       1. Try the proxy endpoint first (better reliability)\n       2. If proxy fails (timeout, error response, etc.), automatically fall back to the primary endpoint\n       3. Your code MUST handle this gracefully with try/except blocks\n\n     Example fallback code structure:\n     ```python\n     def get_data(symbol, start_time, end_time):\n         try:\n             # First try the proxy endpoint\n             response = requests.get(f\"{proxy_url}?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n         except Exception as e:\n             print(f\"Proxy endpoint failed: {str(e)}, falling back to primary endpoint\")\n             # Fall back to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n             response = requests.get(f\"{primary_url}/klines?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n     ```\n     \n6. NEVER include actual API key values in the code, always load them from environment variables.\n\n7. IMPORTANT FOR ALL DATA SOURCES: If a proxy endpoint is provided alongside a primary endpoint, you MUST implement the fallback mechanism described above. This is critical for reliability:\n   - Always try the proxy endpoint first\n   - If the proxy fails, fall back to the primary endpoint\n   - Use appropriate timeout values (10 seconds recommended)\n   - Include proper error handling with try/except blocks\n\nThe code should be completely self-contained and runnable with no arguments.\n\n\nHere's a complete code example that shows how to solve this type of problem:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Note: Binance public API doesn't require an API key for basic price queries\n# However, if we need rate limits increased or private endpoints, we would use these:\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\nBINANCE_API_SECRET = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\")\n\n# Sensitive data patterns to mask in logs\nSENSITIVE_PATTERNS = [\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_KEY\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    #

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Will Bitcoin reach $90k in April?, description: This market will immediately resolve to \"Yes\" if any Binance 1 minute candle for Bitcoin (BTCUSDT) between April 1, 2025, 00:00 and April 30, 2025, 23:59 in the ET timezone has a final \"High\" price of $90,000 or higher. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No.\"\n\nThe resolution source for this market is Binance, specifically the BTCUSDT \"High\" prices available at https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT, with the chart settings on \"1m\" for one-minute candles selected on the top bar.\n\nPlease note that the outcome of this market depends solely on the price data from the Binance BTCUSDT trading pair. Prices from other exchanges, different trading pairs, or spot markets will not be considered for the resolution of this market.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality.

Recommendation found: p1.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p1\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.95, ID: 107781574233715121923716753060733593557784238806659435422878841227899308845079, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.05, ID: 20506045937918217025865257873797843323032020594282910234400200695646887456893, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.950 = 95.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

DO NOT use command-line arguments. Extract all necessary information from the question itself.\n2. Load environment variables from .env files using the python-dotenv package.\n3. For API keys, use the following environment variables:\n   - BINANCE_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_NBA_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_NFL_API_KEY\n   - SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\n\n4. Available Data Sources Information:\n   ALL AVAILABLE API CONFIGURATIONS:\n   - Binance (Category: crypto):\n     * API Key: BINANCE_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.binance.com/api/v3\n     * proxy endpoint: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\n   - Sports Data IO - MLB (Category: sports, Subcategory: baseball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb\n   - Sports Data IO - NBA (Category: sports, Subcategory: basketball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NBA_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nba\n   - Sports Data IO - NFL (Category: sports, Subcategory: football):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NFL_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nfl\n   - Sports Data IO - NHL (Category: sports, Subcategory: hockey):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nhl\n\n5. Query Type Specific Information:\n\n   Cryptocurrency Data Sources:\n   - Binance:\n     * primary: https://api.binance.com/api/v3\n     * proxy: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\n     * RECOMMENDED: Use this proxy endpoint first for better reliability\n     * Example: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy?symbol=BTCUSDT&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime=TIMESTAMP&endTime=TIMESTAMP\n\n     * CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Since a proxy endpoint is provided, you MUST implement a fallback mechanism:\n       1. Try the proxy endpoint first (better reliability)\n       2. If proxy fails (timeout, error response, etc.), automatically fall back to the primary endpoint\n       3. Your code MUST handle this gracefully with try/except blocks\n\n     Example fallback code structure:\n     ```python\n     def get_data(symbol, start_time, end_time):\n         try:\n             # First try the proxy endpoint\n             response = requests.get(f\"{proxy_url}?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n         except Exception as e:\n             print(f\"Proxy endpoint failed: {str(e)}, falling back to primary endpoint\")\n             # Fall back to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n             response = requests.get(f\"{primary_url}/klines?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n     ```\n     \n6. NEVER include actual API key values in the code, always load them from environment variables.\n\n7. IMPORTANT FOR ALL DATA SOURCES: If a proxy endpoint is provided alongside a primary endpoint, you MUST implement the fallback mechanism described above.

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Will Bitcoin reach $90k in April?, description: This market will immediately resolve to \"Yes\" if any Binance 1 minute candle for Bitcoin (BTCUSDT) between April 1, 2025, 00:00 and April 30, 2025, 23:59 in the ET timezone has a final \"High\" price of $90,000 or higher. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No.\"\n\nThe resolution source for this market is Binance, specifically the BTCUSDT \"High\" prices available at https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT, with the chart settings on \"1m\" for one-minute candles selected on the top bar.\n\nPlease note that the outcome of this market depends solely on the price data from the Binance BTCUSDT trading pair.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745329377 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-22 13:42:57 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p1. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Consider verifying the accuracy and completeness of the fetched data or explore alternative data sources or methods to ensure alignment with market sentiment.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# API keys loaded from environment variables\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\n\n# API endpoints\nPRIMARY_API_URL = \"https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines\"\nPROXY_API_URL = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\"\n\ndef fetch_data_from_binance(symbol, interval, start_time, end_time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches data from Binance API with a fallback to a proxy server if the primary fails.\n    \"\"\"\n    params = {\n        \"symbol\": symbol,\n        \"interval\": interval,\n        \"limit\": 1000,  # Adjust based on the maximum allowed by the API\n        \"startTime\": start_time,\n        \"endTime\": end_time\n    }\n    \n    try:\n        # Try fetching data from the proxy endpoint first\n        response = requests.get(PROXY_API_URL, params=params, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n        if data:\n            return data\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Proxy failed with error: {e}, trying primary endpoint.\")\n        # If proxy fails, fallback to the primary endpoint\n        try:\n            response = requests.get(PRIMARY_API_URL, params=params, timeout=10)\n            response.raise_for_status()\n            data = response.json()\n            return data\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"Primary endpoint also failed with error: {e}\")\n            return None\n\ndef check_btc_price_threshold(start_date, end_date, threshold):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if the Bitcoin price reached a certain threshold within a given date range.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert dates to timestamps\n    tz = pytz.timezone(\"US/Eastern\")\n    start_dt = tz.localize(datetime.strptime(start_date, \"%Y-%m-%d\"))\n    end_dt = tz.localize(datetime.strptime(end_date, \"%Y-%m-%d\") + timedelta(days=1))\n    \n    start_ts = int(start_dt.timestamp() * 1000)\n    end_ts = int(end_dt.timestamp() * 1000)\n    \n    # Fetch data\n    data = fetch_data_from_binance(\"BTCUSDT\", \"1m\", start_ts, end_ts)\n    \n    if data:\n        # Check if any candle high price meets or exceeds the threshold\n        for candle in data:\n            high_price = float(candle[2])  # High price is the third element in each candle\n            if high_price >= threshold:\n                return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    # Define the date range and price threshold\n    start_date = \"2025-04-01\"\n    end_date = \"2025-04-30\"\n    price_threshold = 90000\n    \n    # Check if the price threshold was met\n    result = check_btc_price_threshold(start_date, end_date, price_threshold)\n    \n    # Print the result based on the outcome\n    if result:\n        print(\"recommendation: p2\")  # Yes, price reached $90k\n    else:\n        print(\"recommendation: p1\")  # No, price did not reach $90k\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p1\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.950 = 95.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Bitcoin will reach $90k in April 2025 based on Binance's BTCUSDT 1-minute candles. The resolution depends on whether any of those candles hit $90k or higher between April 1 and April 30, 2025, ET.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The timestamp given is April 22, 2025, so the month isn't over yet. That means there's still time for Bitcoin to reach $90k before April 30. But I need to look at the provided search results to see if there's any mention of Bitcoin hitting $90k already in April.\n\nLooking at the search results:\n\n- Result [1] from April 21 mentions Bitcoin surging nearly 5% towards $90k. It says experts are eyeing $150k, but the price was pushing toward $90k. However, it doesn't explicitly state that it reached $90k.\n\n- Result [5] from April 21 talks about a potential surge to $90k by the end of the day. The analysis mentions a high of $89,950 but doesn't confirm hitting $90k.\n\n- Result [8] from April 20 states Bitcoin rebounded to $87k and targets $90k next. It mentions testing key resistance at $88,500 but again no $90k.\n\n- Result [15] from April 21 claims Bitcoin reached a peak of $90k within 24 hours. This is crucial. If this is accurate, then the answer is yes. But I need to verify if this source is reliable and if the data aligns with Binance's BTCUSDT pair.\n\nWait, result [15] is from blockchain.news, which reports that on April 21 at 10:37 AM UTC, Bitcoin hit $90k. However, the user's resolution source is Binance's BTCUSDT pair. The search result [15] mentions Binance's trading data, so if their report is correct, then yes, it did hit $90k. But I need to cross-check with other sources.\n\nLooking at result [6], which is a live price chart from Coinalyze as of April 22, the 24-hour high is listed as $88,877.00. That's below $90k. However, this data is from April 22, and the reported peak in [15] is on April 21. There might be a discrepancy here. Maybe the live data in [6] is as of the current timestamp (April 22), so if the peak was on April 21, it might not show here anymore.\n\nResult [16] from April 12 discusses a potential breakout above $90k, but it's a prediction, not a confirmed event.\n\nResult [15] seems to be the only source claiming Bitcoin hit $90k on April 21. However, I need to check if this is from the Binance BTCUSDT pair. The user's resolution depends solely on Binance's data. The analysis in [15] cites CoinMarketCap, CryptoCompare, Binance, and Glassnode. If Binance's data showed a high of $90k on a 1-minute candle, then the answer is yes. But the live data in [6] as of April 22 shows a 24-hour high of $88,877, which is below $90k. This could mean that the $90k peak reported in [15] was either a brief spike that's not reflected in the 24-hour high on [6], or there might be conflicting information.\n\nAnother angle: the user's query specifies that the resolution is based on Binance's BTCUSDT 1-minute candles. So even if other sources report a different price, only Binance's data matters. The search result [15] mentions Binance's trading data, so if they reported a high of $90k, that's the key. However, the live data in [6] (from Coinalyze) for Binance's BTCUSDT pair shows a 24-hour high of $88,877 as of April 22. This suggests that up to April 22, the price hasn't reached $90k yet. But result [15] claims it did on April 21. There's a conflict here.\n\nI need to resolve this discrepancy. Which source is more reliable? The user's resolution source is Binance's own data. The search result [15] is from blockchain.news, which might be citing Binance's data. If their report is accurate, then the answer is yes. However, the live data in [6] (as of April 22) doesn't show a 24-hour high above $90k. This could mean that the $90k peak was either a brief spike that's not captured in the 24-hour window or that the report in [15] is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the $90k mentioned in [15] is from a different exchange or pair. But the user specified Binance's BTCUSDT. The analysis in [15] explicitly mentions Binance's trading data, so if that's correct, then the answer is yes. However, without direct access to Binance's historical 1-minute candles, I have to rely on the provided search results.\n\nGiven that result [15] states Bitcoin reached $90k on April 21 according to Binance's data, and considering the user's resolution conditions, the answer should be yes (p2). However, the live data in [6] as of April 22 shows a lower high, which might indicate that the $90k was not sustained or perhaps a data error. But according to the user's instructions, if the event date is in the past (April 21 is before April 22), and the source (result [15]) claims it happened, then the resolution should be yes.\n\nBut wait, the current timestamp is April 22, 2025. The query is about whether Bitcoin will reach $90k in April, which includes dates up to April 30. However, the user is asking for resolution based on data up to the current date. Wait, no\u2014the resolution conditions are based on the entire month of April. Since it's only April 22, the month isn't over yet. Therefore, even if it hasn't hit $90k yet, there's still time. But the user's personalization instructions say that if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, return p4. However, the event here is whether Bitcoin reaches $90k at any point in April, which includes dates both before and after the current date.\n\nWait, the current date is April 22, 2025. The query is about whether Bitcoin will reach $90k in April 2025, with the resolution depending on any 1-minute candle on Binance between April 1 and April 30. Since today is April 22, the period from April 22 to April 30 is still in the future. Therefore, the event is partially in the future. However, the user's personalization says that if the event is scheduled for a future date or has not occurred yet, return p4. But in this case, part of the event period (April 1 to April 22) has already passed, and part (April 23 to 30) is future. The resolution condition is whether it happened at any time in April, including both past and future dates. Since the future part is still pending, the event is not fully resolved yet. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, if the event date is in the future relative to the current timestamp, return p4. But the event's outcome could still change because there are future dates left in April. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4 because the event period isn't over yet, and it's still possible for Bitcoin to reach $90k in the remaining days of April.\n\nWait, but the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" However, the event date here is the entire month of April, which includes both past and future dates relative to April 22. Since the event's outcome could still be influenced by future dates, the resolution can't be determined yet. Therefore, the recommendation should be p4.\n\nBut wait, the user's query is to resolve whether Bitcoin reached $90k in April, and the resolution is based on any 1-minute candle in April. Since the current date is April 22, the period from April 1 to April 22 is in the past, and April 23-30 is future. The resolution should consider whether it has already happened in the past dates. If it has, then the answer is yes (p2), regardless of future dates. If it hasn't happened yet, but there's still time, then it's unresolved (p4). So the key is whether in the period from April 1 to April 22, Bitcoin reached $90k on Binance's BTCUSDT.\n\nLooking back at the search results, result [15] claims that on April 21, Bitcoin hit $90k. If that's accurate and based on Binance's data, then the answer is yes (p2). However, result [6] as of April 22 shows a 24-hour high of $88,877, which is below $90k. But the 24-hour high in [6] is for the past 24 hours from April 22, not the entire month. So the 24-hour high on April 22 doesn't negate a higher high on April 21.\n\nTherefore, if result [15] is correct and Bitcoin did hit $90k on April 21 on Binance's BTCUSDT, then the answer is yes (p2). However, if that report is incorrect or refers to a different exchange, then it's still possible that it hasn't happened yet.\n\nGiven that the user's resolution source is Binance, and result [15] cites Binance's trading data, I have to take that into account. Therefore, the recommendation would be p2 (Yes). However, there's a conflicting data point in result [6], but that's the live data as of April 22, which might not include the April 21 peak.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided search results, especially result [15], which states Bitcoin reached $90k on April 21 according to Binance's data, the recommendation should be p2 (Yes). However, I need to ensure that this is indeed from the Binance BTCUSDT pair. The analysis in [15] mentions Binance's trading data, so it's likely accurate. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745329377 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-22 13:42:57 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Bitcoin will reach $90k in April 2025 based on Binance's BTCUSDT 1-minute candles. The resolution depends on whether any of those candles hit $90k or higher between April 1 and April 30, 2025, ET.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The timestamp given is April 22, 2025, so the month isn't over yet. That means there's still time for Bitcoin to reach $90k before April 30. But I need to look at the provided search results to see if there's any mention of Bitcoin hitting $90k already in April.\n\nLooking at the search results:\n\n- Result [1] from April 21 mentions Bitcoin surging nearly 5% towards $90k. It says experts are eyeing $150k, but the price was pushing toward $90k. However, it doesn't explicitly state that it reached $90k.\n\n- Result [5] from April 21 talks about a potential surge to $90k by the end of the day. The analysis mentions a high of $89,950 but doesn't confirm hitting $90k.\n\n- Result [8] from April 20 states Bitcoin rebounded to $87k and targets $90k next. It mentions testing key resistance at $88,500 but again no $90k.\n\n- Result [15] from April 21 claims Bitcoin reached a peak of $90k within 24 hours. This is crucial. If this is accurate, then the answer is yes. But I need to verify if this source is reliable and if the data aligns with Binance's BTCUSDT pair.\n\nWait, result [15] is from blockchain.news, which reports that on April 21 at 10:37 AM UTC, Bitcoin hit $90k. However, the user's resolution source is Binance's BTCUSDT pair. The search result [15] mentions Binance's trading data, so if their report is correct, then yes, it did hit $90k. But I need to cross-check with other sources.\n\nLooking at result [6], which is a live price chart from Coinalyze as of April 22, the 24-hour high is listed as $88,877.00. That's below $90k. However, this data is from April 22, and the reported peak in [15] is on April 21. There might be a discrepancy here. Maybe the live data in [6] is as of the current timestamp (April 22), so if the peak was on April 21, it might not show here anymore.\n\nResult [16] from April 12 discusses a potential breakout above $90k, but it's a prediction, not a confirmed event.\n\nResult [15] seems to be the only source claiming Bitcoin hit $90k on April 21. However, I need to check if this is from the Binance BTCUSDT pair. The user's resolution depends solely on Binance's data. The analysis in [15] cites CoinMarketCap, CryptoCompare, Binance, and Glassnode. If Binance's data showed a high of $90k on a 1-minute candle, then the answer is yes. But the live data in [6] as of April 22 shows a 24-hour high of $88,877, which is below $90k. This could mean that the $90k peak reported in [15] was either a brief spike that's not reflected in the 24-hour high on [6], or there might be conflicting information.\n\nAnother angle: the user's query specifies that the resolution is based on Binance's BTCUSDT 1-minute candles. So even if other sources report a different price, only Binance's data matters. The search result [15] mentions Binance's trading data, so if they reported a high of $90k, that's the key. However, the live data in [6] (from Coinalyze) for Binance's BTCUSDT pair shows a 24-hour high of $88,877 as of April 22. This suggests that up to April 22, the price hasn't reached $90k yet. But result [15] claims it did on April 21. There's a conflict here.\n\nI need to resolve this discrepancy. Which source is more reliable? The user's resolution source is Binance's own data. The search result [15] is from blockchain.news, which might be citing Binance's data. If their report is accurate, then the answer is yes. However, the live data in [6] (as of April 22) doesn't show a 24-hour high above $90k. This could mean that the $90k peak was either a brief spike that's not captured in the 24-hour window or that the report in [15] is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the $90k mentioned in [15] is from a different exchange or pair. But the user specified Binance's BTCUSDT. The analysis in [15] explicitly mentions Binance's trading data, so if that's correct, then the answer is yes. However, without direct access to Binance's historical 1-minute candles, I have to rely on the provided search results.\n\nGiven that result [15] states Bitcoin reached $90k on April 21 according to Binance's data, and considering the user's resolution conditions, the answer should be yes (p2). However, the live data in [6] as of April 22 shows a lower high, which might indicate that the $90k was not sustained or perhaps a data error. But according to the user's instructions, if the event date is in the past (April 21 is before April 22), and the source (result [15]) claims it happened, then the resolution should be yes.\n\nBut wait, the current timestamp is April 22, 2025. The query is about whether Bitcoin will reach $90k in April, which includes dates up to April 30. However, the user is asking for resolution based on data up to the current date. Wait, no\u2014the resolution conditions are based on the entire month of April. Since it's only April 22, the month isn't over yet. Therefore, even if it hasn't hit $90k yet, there's still time. But the user's personalization instructions say that if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, return p4. However, the event here is whether Bitcoin reaches $90k at any point in April, which includes dates both before and after the current date.\n\nWait, the current date is April 22, 2025.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Bitcoin will reach $90k in April 2025 based on the Binance BTCUSDT 1-minute candle high prices. The resolution depends on whether any 1-minute candle's high on Binance hits or exceeds $90k between April 1 and April 30, 2025.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current timestamp is April 22, 2025. So the event period is from April 1 to April 30, and we're currently on April 22. The user is asking if Bitcoin has already hit $90k in any 1-minute candle up to now, or if it's likely to do so by the end of April.\n\nLooking at the provided search results, several sources mention Bitcoin's price movements around the $90k mark. For example, result [2] from April 21, 2025, states that Bitcoin surged 3.5% overnight and was trading around $87,500, aiming for a $90k retest. Result [13] from April 22 mentions Bitcoin extending gains above $88k and potentially targeting $90k. Result [15] shows real-time trading data with a high of $89,900 on April 22, which is very close to $90k but doesn't quite reach it. \n\nHowever, none of the sources explicitly confirm that a 1-minute candle on Binance reached $90k. The closest is result [15] with a high of $89,900, which is just $100 short. There's also a prediction market in result [9] that's still open, indicating uncertainty as of April 22. \n\nThe user's previous response was p2 (Yes), but they want a recheck. Since the current data up to April 22 doesn't show a confirmed $90k high on Binance, and the remaining days in April could still see price movements, the outcome isn't certain. However, the ancillary data says to assume the most probable outcome if the event date is in the past. Since we're still within April, the event hasn't concluded. But the user's instructions say if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp (which it isn't; it's ongoing), return p4. However, since the event is ongoing and hasn't concluded, but the user's previous answer was p2, maybe there's conflicting info.\n\nWait, the current date is April 22, and the event runs until April 30. Since the event is still ongoing, and the user is asking now, we have to check if it has happened up to now. If not, but there's a possibility it could happen in the remaining days, but the user's instructions say if the event is in the future, return p4. But the event is current, not future. However, the resolution conditions require the event to have occurred by April 30. Since we're on April 22, the event is still ongoing. The user's personalization says if the event is scheduled for a future date or hasn't occurred yet, return p4. But the event is ongoing, so we need to check if it has already happened. \n\nLooking at the sources, result [15] shows a high of $89,900 on April 22, which is close but not $90k. Other sources like [13] mention Bitcoin trading above $88k and targeting $90k, but no confirmation. Therefore, as of April 22, the $90k hasn't been reached yet. However, the event is still ongoing until April 30. The user's instructions say if the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome. But since the event is ongoing, and the current date is within the event period, we can't assume it's concluded. However, the user's query is about whether it will reach $90k in April, and the resolution is based on whether it has happened by now or will happen by April 30. \n\nBut according to the user's personalization instructions: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" Since the event is ongoing (April 1-30, current date April 22), it's not entirely in the past. However, the user's ancillary data says to resolve based on whether it has happened by the end of April. Since we're in the middle, but the user is asking now, we have to determine based on available data up to now and the likelihood of it happening in the remaining days.\n\nThe search results indicate strong bullish momentum, with Bitcoin approaching $90k but not yet reaching it. Technical analyses suggest potential resistance around $88k-$90k [3][6][8]. However, some sources predict a possible breakout to $90k [2][13]. Given the mixed signals and the current price near $89k but not yet hitting $90k, and considering the user's previous p2 response, perhaps the initial assessment was premature. Since the price hasn't reached $90k yet as of April 22, but the event is still ongoing, the correct resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve yet) if the event is still pending. However, the user's instructions say if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, return p4. Since the event period includes the current date and future dates up to April 30, but the user is asking now, the resolution should be based on whether it has already occurred. If it hasn't occurred yet, but the event is still ongoing, the answer would be p4. However, the user's ancillary data says to assume the most probable outcome if the event date is in the past. Since the event is ongoing, this is a bit conflicting. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome... If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp... return p4.\" Since the event runs until April 30, which is in the future from April 22, but part of the event period (April 1-22) is in the past. However, the resolution condition is whether any 1-minute candle in the entire April period hits $90k. Since the event is not fully in the past (still 8 days left), but the user is asking now, the correct approach is to check if it has happened up to now. If not, but there's a possibility in the remaining days, but the user's instructions say to return p4 only if the event is scheduled for the future. Since part of the event is in the past and part is in the future, but the resolution depends on the entire period, which is not yet concluded, the answer should be p4. However, the user's previous response was p2, which might have been incorrect. \n\nBut looking at the search results, there's no confirmation of $90k being hit yet. The highest mentioned is $89,900 in result [15]. Therefore, as of April 22, it hasn't happened. However, the event is still ongoing, so the resolution can't be determined yet. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the future, return p4. Since the event is ongoing (part past, part future), but the resolution depends on the entire period, which isn't over, the answer should be p4. However, the user's ancillary data says to assume the most probable outcome if the event date is in the past. But since the event isn't fully in the past, this is tricky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's query is to resolve based on data up to the current date, not the entire April. But the query's description says the resolution is based on the entire April period. Since we're on April 22, the event isn't over, so the resolution can't be determined yet. Therefore, the correct answer is p4. However, the user's previous response was p2, so perhaps there was a mistake. \n\nGiven the current data, since Bitcoin hasn't hit $90k yet as of April 22, but the event is still ongoing, the recommendation should be p4. However, the user's personalization says to consider the market conditions in the prompt. The ancillary data defines p2 as Yes (if it happens anytime in April). Since the event isn't over, but the user is asking now, perhaps the correct answer is p4. But the user's instructions say if the event is in the future, return p4. Since part of the event is in the future (April 23-30), the answer is p4. However, if the event is considered ongoing (current date within the event period), then it's not future, but the outcome is still undetermined. \n\nThis is a bit confusing, but based on the strictest interpretation, since the event period includes dates after the current timestamp (April 22), the event is not entirely in the past. Therefore, the resolution cannot be determined yet, and the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745329377 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-22 13:42:57 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p2. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Bitcoin will reach $90k in April 2025 based on the Binance BTCUSDT 1-minute candle high prices. The resolution depends on whether any 1-minute candle's high on Binance hits or exceeds $90k between April 1 and April 30, 2025.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current timestamp is April 22, 2025. So the event period is from April 1 to April 30, and we're currently on April 22. The user is asking if Bitcoin has already hit $90k in any 1-minute candle up to now, or if it's likely to do so by the end of April.\n\nLooking at the provided search results, several sources mention Bitcoin's price movements around the $90k mark. For example, result [2] from April 21, 2025, states that Bitcoin surged 3.5% overnight and was trading around $87,500, aiming for a $90k retest. Result [13] from April 22 mentions Bitcoin extending gains above $88k and potentially targeting $90k. Result [15] shows real-time trading data with a high of $89,900 on April 22, which is very close to $90k but doesn't quite reach it. \n\nHowever, none of the sources explicitly confirm that a 1-minute candle on Binance reached $90k. The closest is result [15] with a high of $89,900, which is just $100 short. There's also a prediction market in result [9] that's still open, indicating uncertainty as of April 22. \n\nThe user's previous response was p2 (Yes), but they want a recheck. Since the current data up to April 22 doesn't show a confirmed $90k high on Binance, and the remaining days in April could still see price movements, the outcome isn't certain. However, the ancillary data says to assume the most probable outcome if the event date is in the past. Since we're still within April, the event hasn't concluded. But the user's instructions say if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp (which it isn't; it's ongoing), return p4. However, since the event is ongoing and hasn't concluded, but the user's previous answer was p2, maybe there's conflicting info.\n\nWait, the current date is April 22, and the event runs until April 30. Since the event is still ongoing, and the user is asking now, we have to check if it has happened up to now. If not, but there's a possibility it could happen in the remaining days, but the user's instructions say if the event is in the future, return p4. But the event is current, not future. However, the resolution conditions require the event to have occurred by April 30. Since we're on April 22, the event is still ongoing.

But in the same result [5], there's a post where someone mentions BTC surging beyond $88k. Then, in result [14], the live price chart shows a 24-hour high of 89,900.00 as of April 22. That's very close but not reaching 90k. \n\nWait, the user's query is about any 1-minute candle high reaching $90k in April. The current date is April 22, so there's still time until April 30. However, the provided search results only go up to April 22. The latest data points are from April 22, and none of them show Bitcoin actually hitting $90k. The closest is 89,900 in result [14], which is still $100 short. \n\nBut the user's personalization says to consider the market conditions and any updates. The ancillary data specifies that the resolution depends solely on Binance's BTCUSDT 1-minute candles. The search results don't show any instance where the high reached $90k. Therefore, as of April 22, the answer would be No (p1). However, the market is still open until April 30. But the user is asking for the current resolution based on available data. Since the data provided doesn't include any 1-minute candle reaching $90k, the answer should be p1 (No). But the user's previous response was p4, which might be an error. Following the instructions, if the event hasn't occurred yet (since it's still April 22 and the period is until April 30), but the current timestamp is April 22, and the event is ongoing, the correct response would be p4 if the event hasn't happened yet. Wait, the personalization says if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, return p4. But the event period includes dates up to April 30, which is in the future from April 22. However, the query is whether it happened in April, and part of April is still future. But the resolution conditions are such that if by April 30 it happens, it's Yes. Since the current date is April 22, and the event is ongoing, but the user is asking now, the correct response would be p4 because the event hasn't concluded yet. However, the personalization says if the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome. But the event period is from April 1 to April 30, which is partially in the future. Therefore, since the event is not fully in the past, the resolution should be p4. But the user's previous response was p4, and they want a different approach. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\"\n\nSo, the previous answer was p4, but the user wants a re-evaluation. Let me check the data again. The search results include up to April 22, and none show a 1-minute candle high of $90k. However, result [4] from April 21 mentions Bitcoin nearing $90k with a price of $89,500. Result [14] on April 22 shows a 24-hour high of $89,900.00, which is very close but not reaching $90k. Since the query requires the high of any 1-minute candle to reach $90k, and the data up to April 22 doesn't show that, the answer as of now would be No (p1). However, the event is still ongoing until April 30. But according to the instructions, if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, return p4. Since the event period includes future dates (April 23-30), the resolution should be p4. But the user's ancillary data says to resolve based on whether it has happened by now. Wait, the query is whether it will happen in April, but the resolution is immediate if it has happened by any time in April. Since the current date is April 22, and the event period is until April 30, but the user is asking now, the correct response would be p4 because the event hasn't concluded. However, the personalization says if the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. But the event is ongoing, so it's not entirely in the past. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4. But the user wants a different approach. Maybe the user is considering that even though the event is ongoing, the data up to now doesn't show it hitting $90k, so the answer is p1 (No) as of now, but the market is still open. However, according to the rules, if the event is still ongoing (i.e., the end date hasn't passed), it's p4. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4. But the user's previous response was p4, and they want a re-evaluation. Maybe the user is confused. Alternatively, perhaps the event's end date is April 30, but the current date is April 22, so the event is still ongoing. Therefore, the resolution can't be determined yet, hence p4. But the user's personalization says to consider the market conditions. The market conditions in the ancillary data say p2 is Yes if it happened anytime in April. Since the event is ongoing, and the data up to now doesn't show it, but there's still time, the answer is p4. However, the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. But the event is not entirely in the past. Therefore, the correct answer is p4. But the user wants a different approach. Maybe the user is considering that the event hasn't happened yet, but the data suggests it's possible. However, according to the rules, until the event period concludes, it's p4. Therefore, the recommendation remains p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1745329377 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-22 13:42:57 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p2.

The user wants to know if Bitcoin reached $90k in April 2025 based on the 1-minute candles on Binance's BTCUSDT pair. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. It's April 22, 2025. The market is still ongoing until April 30, so there's time left. But the user's previous response was p4, which I think is a mistake here. Wait, the personalization mentions previous responses returning p2 and p4, but the current query's resolution conditions are p1, p2, p3. Maybe there's a confusion in the setup. Anyway, focusing on the data.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention Bitcoin approaching or exceeding $90k. For example, result [4] from April 21 states Bitcoin was at $89,500 and nearing $90k. Result [5] on April 22 mentions a high of $87,795, but another part of the same result shows a surge to $88,465.99. Result [14] from Coinalyze on April 22 shows a high of $89,900.00 in the 24-hour period. Wait, that's crucial. If the 24-hour high was $89,900, that's just $100 short of $90k. But the query requires a 1-minute candle high of $90k or more. \n\nWait, result [14] lists the 24-hour high as 89,900.00, which is under 90k. However, result [4] mentions Bitcoin at $89,500 on April 21, and result [5] on April 22 shows a high of $88,465.99. But in the same result [5], there's a post where someone mentions BTC surging beyond $88k. Then, in result [14], the live price chart shows a 24-hour high of 89,900.00 as of April 22. That's very close but not reaching 90k. \n\nWait, the user's query is about any 1-minute candle high reaching $90k in April. The current date is April 22, so there's still time until April 30. However, the provided search results only go up to April 22. The latest data points are from April 22, and none of them show Bitcoin actually hitting $90k. The closest is 89,900 in result [14], which is still $100 short. \n\nBut the user's personalization says to consider the market conditions and any updates. The ancillary data specifies that the resolution depends solely on Binance's BTCUSDT 1-minute candles. The search results don't show any instance where the high reached $90k. Therefore, as of April 22, the answer would be No (p1). However, the market is still open until April 30. But the user is asking for the current resolution based on available data. Since the data provided doesn't include any 1-minute candle reaching $90k, the answer should be p1 (No). But the user's previous response was p4, which might be an error. Following the instructions, if the event hasn't occurred yet (since it's still April 22 and the period is until April 30), but the current timestamp is April 22, and the event is ongoing, the correct response would be p4 if the event hasn't happened yet. Wait, the personalization says if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, return p4. But the event period includes dates up to April 30, which is in the future from April 22. However, the query is whether it happened in April, and part of April is still future. But the resolution conditions are such that if by April 30 it happens, it's Yes. Since the current date is April 22, and the event is ongoing, but the user is asking now, the correct response would be p4 because the event hasn't concluded yet. However, the personalization says if the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome. But the event period is from April 1 to April 30, which is partially in the future. Therefore, since the event is not fully in the past, the resolution should be p4. But the user's previous response was p4, and they want a different approach. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\"\n\nSo, the previous answer was p4, but the user wants a re-evaluation. Let me check the data again. The search results include up to April 22, and none show a 1-minute candle high of $90k. However, result [4] from April 21 mentions Bitcoin nearing $90k with a price of $89,500. Result [14] on April 22 shows a 24-hour high of $89,900.00, which is very close but not reaching $90k. Since the query requires the high of any 1-minute candle to reach $90k, and the data up to April 22 doesn't show that, the answer as of now would be No (p1). However, the event is still ongoing until April 30. But according to the instructions, if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, return p4. Since the event period includes future dates (April 23-30), the resolution should be p4. But the user's ancillary data says to resolve based on whether it has happened by now. Wait, the query is whether it will happen in April, but the resolution is immediate if it has happened by any time in April. Since the current date is April 22, and the event period is until April 30, but the user is asking now, the correct response would be p4 because the event hasn't concluded. However, the personalization says if the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. But the event is ongoing, so it's not entirely in the past. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4. But the user wants a different approach. Maybe the user is considering that even though the event is ongoing, the data up to now doesn't show it hitting $90k, so the answer is p1 (No) as of now, but the market is still open. However, according to the rules, if the event is still ongoing (i.e., the end date hasn't passed), it's p4. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4. But the user's previous response was p4, and they want a re-evaluation. Maybe the user is confused. Alternatively, perhaps the event's end date is April 30, but the current date is April 22, so the event is still ongoing. Therefore, the resolution can't be determined yet, hence p4. But the user's personalization says to consider the market conditions. The market conditions in the ancillary data say p2 is Yes if it happened anytime in April. Since the event is ongoing, and the data up to now doesn't show it, but there's still time, the answer is p4. However, the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. But the event is not entirely in the past. Therefore, the correct answer is p4. But the user wants a different approach. Maybe the user is considering that the event hasn't happened yet, but the data suggests it's possible. However, according to the rules, until the event period concludes, it's p4. Therefore, the recommendation remains p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.95, ID: 107781574233715121923716753060733593557784238806659435422878841227899308845079, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.05, ID: 20506045937918217025865257873797843323032020594282910234400200695646887456893, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3.

Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Available Crypto Data Sources:\n    - Binance: Provides cryptocurrency price data for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies\n  * Available Sports Data Sources:\n    - Sports Data IO - MLB (baseball): MLB baseball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NBA (basketball): NBA basketball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NFL (football): NFL football scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NHL (hockey): NHL hockey scores, statistics, and game data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Will Bitcoin reach $90k in April?, description: This market will immediately resolve to \"Yes\" if any Binance 1 minute candle for Bitcoin (BTCUSDT) between April 1, 2025, 00:00 and April 30, 2025, 23:59 in the ET timezone has a final \"High\" price of $90,000 or higher. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No.\"\n\nThe resolution source for this market is Binance, specifically the BTCUSDT \"High\" prices available at https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT, with the chart settings on \"1m\" for one-minute candles selected on the top bar.\n\nPlease note that the outcome of this market depends solely on the price data from the Binance BTCUSDT trading pair. Prices from other exchanges, different trading pairs, or spot markets will not be considered for the resolution of this market.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",
