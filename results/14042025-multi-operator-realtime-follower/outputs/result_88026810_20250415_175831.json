      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"Common Sense\" during her next White House press briefing. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if she does, \"No\" otherwise. The key here is to check if she used the term in the most recent briefing on April 15, 2025.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided search results. The latest briefing mentioned is on April 15, 2025, which is the same day as the current date. The search result [2] and [6] both reference the April 15 briefing. However, the transcripts or detailed content of that specific briefing aren't provided in the search results. The available transcripts are from earlier dates like April 11, March 26, etc.\n\nLooking at the transcripts from previous briefings, Leavitt frequently uses \"common sense\" in her responses. For example, in the March 5 briefing [14], she mentions \"common-sense policy\" regarding men in women's sports. On January 31 [10][17], she uses \"common sense\" in discussing DEI initiatives. Similarly, on February 12 [13], she refers to \"common sense\" in the context of the Gulf of America naming.\n\nHowever, the critical point is the April 15 briefing. Since the search results don't include the transcript for that day, but the video is listed in [2] and [6], I need to infer based on available data. If the user's current timestamp is April 15, and the briefing happened earlier that day, but the transcript isn't provided, the answer depends on whether the term was used in that briefing.\n\nBut wait, the user provided search result [1] is from January 29, 2025, where she uses \"common sense\" in discussing federal bureaucracy. The April 11 briefing [15] doesn't mention \"common sense\" in the provided excerpt. The March 26 briefing [16] also doesn't show the term in the excerpt. The latest available transcript is April 11, which doesn't include \"common sense.\"\n\nSince the April 15 briefing's content isn't detailed here, but given her pattern of using the term frequently, there's a possibility she did. However, without explicit evidence from the April 15 transcript, the resolution should default to the available information. The user's personalization instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. But since the event (April 15 briefing) is on the same day as the current timestamp, and the briefing has already occurred, but the transcript isn't provided, we can't confirm. However, the user might have access to the live briefing or transcript, which isn't shown here. \n\nWait, the search result [6] is a YouTube video of the April 15 briefing. The transcript isn't provided, but the title is \"LIVE: White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt holds a briefing with reporters \u2014 4/15/2025\". Since the user's personalization says to use provided URLs heavily, but the transcript isn't here, maybe the video content isn't accessible. However, the user's query is about whether she said \"common sense\" in the next briefing, which on April 15 is the most recent. Since the search results don't include the transcript for that day, but her past behavior shows frequent use, it's possible. But without explicit evidence, the safe answer is \"No\" unless proven otherwise. However, the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Given her history, it's probable she used it, but without confirmation, the resolution should be p4? Wait, the resolution conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 0.5. The user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But if the event is on the same day and the briefing has happened, but no transcript is available, the resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve)? Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" Since the event date is April 15, same as current date, and the briefing has occurred, but no transcript is provided in the search results, we have to check if any sources mention her saying \"common sense\" on that day. The search results don't include the April 15 transcript, only that the briefing occurred. Therefore, there's no evidence she said it, so the resolution would be \"No\" (p1). But wait, the user's personalization also says if the user provides URLs, use them. The user provided a URL to the April 15 briefing video [6], but the transcript isn't included. Since the assistant can't watch the video, but the user might have access, but in the context of the provided search results, there's no mention of \"common sense\" in the April 15 briefing. Therefore, based on the provided data, the answer is \"No\". However, in the March 5 briefing [14], she said \"common-sense policy\", which would count as the term \"common sense\" in a compound form. But the user's query specifies that pluralization/possessive counts, but other forms do not. \"Common-sense\" as a hyphenated compound would count, so that instance would count. But that's from a previous briefing. The current query is about the next briefing, which is April 15. Since the provided search results don't show her using the term on April 15, the resolution is \"No\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"Common Sense\" during her next White House press briefing. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if she does, \"No\" otherwise. The key here is to check if she used the term in the most recent briefing on April 15, 2025.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided search results. The latest briefing mentioned is on April 15, 2025, which is the same day as the current date. The search result [2] and [6] both reference the April 15 briefing. However, the transcripts or detailed content of that specific briefing aren't provided in the search results. The available transcripts are from earlier dates like April 11, March 26, etc.\n\nLooking at the transcripts from previous briefings, Leavitt frequently uses \"common sense\" in her responses. For example, in the March 5 briefing [14], she mentions \"common-sense policy\" regarding men in women's sports. On January 31 [10][17], she uses \"common sense\" in discussing DEI initiatives. Similarly, on February 12 [13], she refers to \"common sense\" in the context of the Gulf of America naming.\n\nHowever, the critical point is the April 15 briefing. Since the search results don't include the transcript for that day, but the video is listed in [2] and [6], I need to infer based on available data. If the user's current timestamp is April 15, and the briefing happened earlier that day, but the transcript isn't provided, the answer depends on whether the term was used in that briefing.\n\nBut wait, the user provided search result [1] is from January 29, 2025, where she uses \"common sense\" in discussing federal bureaucracy. The April 11 briefing [15] doesn't mention \"common sense\" in the provided excerpt. The March 26 briefing [16] also doesn't show the term in the excerpt. The latest available transcript is April 11, which doesn't include \"common sense.\"\n\nSince the April 15 briefing's content isn't detailed here, but given her pattern of using the term frequently, there's a possibility she did. However, without explicit evidence from the April 15 transcript, the resolution should default to the available information. The user's personalization instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. But since the event (April 15 briefing) is on the same day as the current timestamp, and the briefing has already occurred, but the transcript isn't provided, we can't confirm. However, the user might have access to the live briefing or transcript, which isn't shown here. \n\nWait, the search result [6] is a YouTube video of the April 15 briefing. The transcript isn't provided, but the title is \"LIVE: White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt holds a briefing with reporters \u2014 4/15/2025\". Since the user's personalization says to use provided URLs heavily, but the transcript isn't here, maybe the video content isn't accessible. However, the user's query is about whether she said \"common sense\" in the next briefing, which on April 15 is the most recent. Since the search results don't include the transcript for that day, but her past behavior shows frequent use, it's possible. But without explicit evidence, the safe answer is \"No\" unless proven otherwise. However, the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Given her history, it's probable she used it, but without confirmation, the resolution should be p4? Wait, the resolution conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 0.5. The user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But if the event is on the same day and the briefing has happened, but no transcript is available, the resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve)? Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" Since the event date is April 15, same as current date, and the briefing has occurred, but no transcript is provided in the search results, we have to check if any sources mention her saying \"common sense\" on that day. The search results don't include the April 15 transcript, only that the briefing occurred. Therefore, there's no evidence she said it, so the resolution would be \"No\" (p1). But wait, the user's personalization also says if the user provides URLs, use them. The user provided a URL to the April 15 briefing video [6], but the transcript isn't included. Since the assistant can't watch the video, but the user might have access, but in the context of the provided search results, there's no mention of \"common sense\" in the April 15 briefing. Therefore, based on the provided data, the answer is \"No\". However, in the March 5 briefing [14], she said \"common-sense policy\", which would count as the term \"common sense\" in a compound form. But the user's query specifies that pluralization/possessive counts, but other forms do not. \"Common-sense\" as a hyphenated compound would count, so that instance would count. But that's from a previous briefing. The current query is about the next briefing, which is April 15. Since the provided search results don't show her using the term on April 15, the resolution is \"No\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.505, ID: 50815429862644589438645669121347385648144785778506146568275162465071390224181, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.495, ID: 113306789848940727981356903702882710428973821657644965265423120722254738212415, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market is relatively uncertain (YES: 0.505, NO: 0.495)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

The market resolves to \"Yes\" if she did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mentions of the April 15 briefing. Looking at the search results, the most recent ones are from April 11, 2025 (results 7, 13, 14). Result 13 mentions a live briefing on April 15, but the transcript isn't provided here. The user's current date is April 15, 2025, so the briefing in question might have just happened, but the available data doesn't include the transcript for that specific date.\n\nNext, I'll review all instances where \"common sense\" was mentioned in previous briefings. Results 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 15 show that Leavitt frequently uses the term \"common sense\" in various contexts, like policies on women's sports, tariffs, DEI initiatives, and government spending. For example, in result 2 from February 25, she mentions \"commonsense efforts to ban men from women's sports.\" In result 9 from January 31, she agrees that eliminating DEI is \"common sense.\" \n\nHowever, the key here is the April 15 briefing. Since the search results don't include the transcript for that specific date, I can't confirm if \"common sense\" was used there. The user's personalization instructs to focus on the April 15 briefing and verify directly from the transcript or video. Without access to that specific source, I can't definitively say \"Yes.\" \n\nAdditionally, the resolution conditions state that if no briefing happens by December 31, 2025, it resolves to \"No.\" But since the briefing did occur on April 15 (as per result 13), but the transcript isn't available in the provided data, I have to rely on the existing information. \n\nGiven the absence of the April 15 transcript in the search results and the requirement to base the answer solely on provided sources, I can't confirm the usage of \"common sense\" on that specific date.

Avoid speculative reasoning based on past usage patterns.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt said \"common sense\" during the April 15, 2025 White House press briefing. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if she did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mentions of the April 15 briefing. Looking at the search results, the most recent ones are from April 11, 2025 (results 7, 13, 14). Result 13 mentions a live briefing on April 15, but the transcript isn't provided here. The user's current date is April 15, 2025, so the briefing in question might have just happened, but the available data doesn't include the transcript for that specific date.\n\nNext, I'll review all instances where \"common sense\" was mentioned in previous briefings. Results 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 15 show that Leavitt frequently uses the term \"common sense\" in various contexts, like policies on women's sports, tariffs, DEI initiatives, and government spending. For example, in result 2 from February 25, she mentions \"commonsense efforts to ban men from women's sports.\" In result 9 from January 31, she agrees that eliminating DEI is \"common sense.\" \n\nHowever, the key here is the April 15 briefing. Since the search results don't include the transcript for that specific date, I can't confirm if \"common sense\" was used there. The user's personalization instructs to focus on the April 15 briefing and verify directly from the transcript or video. Without access to that specific source, I can't definitively say \"Yes.\" \n\nAdditionally, the resolution conditions state that if no briefing happens by December 31, 2025, it resolves to \"No.\" But since the briefing did occur on April 15 (as per result 13), but the transcript isn't available in the provided data, I have to rely on the existing information. \n\nGiven the absence of the April 15 transcript in the search results and the requirement to base the answer solely on provided sources, I can't confirm the usage of \"common sense\" on that specific date. Therefore, the recommendation would be \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.505, ID: 50815429862644589438645669121347385648144785778506146568275162465071390224181, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.495, ID: 113306789848940727981356903702882710428973821657644965265423120722254738212415, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market is relatively uncertain (YES: 0.505, NO: 0.495)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nIf the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt said \"common sense\" during the April 15, 2025 White House press briefing. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Yes\" if she uses the term, considering pluralization or possessive forms, but not other variations. The resolution sources are the video and transcripts of the briefing.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mentions of the April 15 briefing. Looking at the search results, there are entries for April 15 from sources like LiveNOW from FOX and CNBC Television (results 2 and 3). These are live briefings, but the transcripts or specific mentions of \"common sense\" aren't directly provided in the search results. \n\nNext, I should look for any transcripts or mentions of the April 15 briefing. The search results include transcripts up to April 11 (result 16) and mentions of briefings on April 1 (result 15) and April 8 (result 1), but nothing specific for April 15. The user provided a personalization instruction to focus solely on the transcript or video from the April 15 briefing. However, the available search results don't include the actual transcript or video content from that day. \n\nThere's a mention in result 4 from January 31, 2025, where Leavitt used \"common sense\" in the context of DEI initiatives. Another instance is in result 10 from January 28, 2025, where she mentioned restoring \"common sense to the federal government.\" However, these are from earlier dates and not the April 15 briefing.\n\nSince the user emphasized relying on the April 15 transcript or video, and the provided search results don't include that specific content, I can't confirm if \"common sense\" was mentioned. The available data doesn't show any evidence of her using the term on April 15. Without the actual transcript or video from that day, the answer must default to the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The user's instructions state that if no verifiable information is available and the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. Given that the event date is today (April 15, 2025) and the current time is 5:57 PM UTC, which is after the typical briefing time (12 PM to 3 PM ET), but without the transcript, the resolution would be \"No\" unless evidence is found. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. But since the briefing happened today and the transcript isn't available yet, maybe it's still pending. Wait, the current timestamp is 17:52:05 UTC on April 15, which is 1:52 PM ET. The briefing was scheduled for 1 PM ET. If the transcript isn't available yet, the market can't be resolved yet. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past relative to the current timestamp, which it is (5:57 PM UTC is after the briefing time), but without the transcript, we have to check. Since the search results don't include the transcript, and the user provided no updates, the answer would be p4. Wait, no, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But the ancillary data says if no briefing happens by Dec 31, resolve to No. But the briefing did happen on April 15, as per results 2 and 3. However, without the transcript, we can't confirm. The user's instruction says to focus solely on the transcript or video from April 15. Since it's not provided, and the event date is today, which is in the past, but no info is available, the resolution would be p4 (unknown). Wait, the resolution conditions have p3 as 0.5 for unknown. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, the ancillary data says if no such briefing happens, resolve to No. But the briefing did happen, so it's not about that. The lack of transcript means we can't confirm, so according to the rules, if no verifiable info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But how to determine that? Leavitt has used \"common sense\" in past briefings (results 4, 10, 16), so maybe it's probable she did again. But without evidence, we can't assume. The user's instruction says to avoid speculative reasoning based on past usage. Therefore, without the April 15 transcript, the answer must be p4. Wait, but the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, the ancillary data's resolution conditions have p3 as 0.5, but the user's instructions say to end with recommendation p1-p4. The market resolves to Yes (p2) if the term is used, No (p1) otherwise. Since the transcript isn't available, and we can't verify, the correct recommendation is p4. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But the instructions also say if the event date is in the past and no info, default to p4. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\" \n\nIn this case, the event happened (April 15 briefing occurred), but no transcript is available. The available information doesn't include the transcript, so we can't verify. Therefore, we can't reasonably infer the outcome, so default to p4. However, the user's additional instructions say to re-evaluate once the transcript is available, but since it's not provided, we have to proceed. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.).

If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744739525 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-15 17:52:05 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please provide a focused analysis on the April 15, 2025 briefing, verifying directly from the transcript or video whether 'common sense' was mentioned. Avoid speculative reasoning based on past usage patterns.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please re-evaluate once the transcript or video from the April 15, 2025 briefing is available. Focus solely on this source to determine if 'common sense' was mentioned.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt said \"common sense\" during the April 15, 2025 White House press briefing. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Yes\" if she uses the term, considering pluralization or possessive forms, but not other variations. The resolution sources are the video and transcripts of the briefing.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mentions of the April 15 briefing. Looking at the search results, there are entries for April 15 from sources like LiveNOW from FOX and CNBC Television (results 2 and 3). These are live briefings, but the transcripts or specific mentions of \"common sense\" aren't directly provided in the search results. \n\nNext, I should look for any transcripts or mentions of the April 15 briefing. The search results include transcripts up to April 11 (result 16) and mentions of briefings on April 1 (result 15) and April 8 (result 1), but nothing specific for April 15. The user provided a personalization instruction to focus solely on the transcript or video from the April 15 briefing. However, the available search results don't include the actual transcript or video content from that day. \n\nThere's a mention in result 4 from January 31, 2025, where Leavitt used \"common sense\" in the context of DEI initiatives. Another instance is in result 10 from January 28, 2025, where she mentioned restoring \"common sense to the federal government.\" However, these are from earlier dates and not the April 15 briefing.\n\nSince the user emphasized relying on the April 15 transcript or video, and the provided search results don't include that specific content, I can't confirm if \"common sense\" was mentioned. The available data doesn't show any evidence of her using the term on April 15. Without the actual transcript or video from that day, the answer must default to the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The user's instructions state that if no verifiable information is available and the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. Given that the event date is today (April 15, 2025) and the current time is 5:57 PM UTC, which is after the typical briefing time (12 PM to 3 PM ET), but without the transcript, the resolution would be \"No\" unless evidence is found. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. But since the briefing happened today and the transcript isn't available yet, maybe it's still pending. Wait, the current timestamp is 17:52:05 UTC on April 15, which is 1:52 PM ET. The briefing was scheduled for 1 PM ET. If the transcript isn't available yet, the market can't be resolved yet. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past relative to the current timestamp, which it is (5:57 PM UTC is after the briefing time), but without the transcript, we have to check. Since the search results don't include the transcript, and the user provided no updates, the answer would be p4. Wait, no, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But the ancillary data says if no briefing happens by Dec 31, resolve to No. But the briefing did happen on April 15, as per results 2 and 3. However, without the transcript, we can't confirm. The user's instruction says to focus solely on the transcript or video from April 15. Since it's not provided, and the event date is today, which is in the past, but no info is available, the resolution would be p4 (unknown). Wait, the resolution conditions have p3 as 0.5 for unknown. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, the ancillary data says if no such briefing happens, resolve to No. But the briefing did happen, so it's not about that. The lack of transcript means we can't confirm, so according to the rules, if no verifiable info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But how to determine that? Leavitt has used \"common sense\" in past briefings (results 4, 10, 16), so maybe it's probable she did again. But without evidence, we can't assume. The user's instruction says to avoid speculative reasoning based on past usage. Therefore, without the April 15 transcript, the answer must be p4. Wait, but the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, the ancillary data's resolution conditions have p3 as 0.5, but the user's instructions say to end with recommendation p1-p4. The market resolves to Yes (p2) if the term is used, No (p1) otherwise. Since the transcript isn't available, and we can't verify, the correct recommendation is p4. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But the instructions also say if the event date is in the past and no info, default to p4. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\" \n\nIn this case, the event happened (April 15 briefing occurred), but no transcript is available. The available information doesn't include the transcript, so we can't verify. Therefore, we can't reasonably infer the outcome, so default to p4. However, the user's additional instructions say to re-evaluate once the transcript is available, but since it's not provided, we have to proceed. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.505, ID: 50815429862644589438645669121347385648144785778506146568275162465071390224181, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.495, ID: 113306789848940727981356903702882710428973821657644965265423120722254738212415, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market is relatively uncertain (YES: 0.505, NO: 0.495)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744739525 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-15 17:52:05 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please re-evaluate once the transcript or video from the April 15, 2025 briefing is available. Focus solely on this source to determine if 'common sense' was mentioned."

        "critique": "The response from the perplexity solver is thorough and well-reasoned, focusing on the lack of available transcript or video from the April 15, 2025 briefing to make a definitive resolution. The solver correctly identifies that without the specific evidence required by the query (i.e., the transcript or video where 'common sense' could be verified), the recommendation must default to p4, indicating that the outcome cannot be determined at this time. The response is methodical and aligns with the user's instructions to avoid speculative reasoning based on past usage patterns and to focus solely on the transcript or video from the specified date. The solver navigates the complexities of the user's instructions and ancillary data effectively, arriving at a logical conclusion under the given constraints.",
