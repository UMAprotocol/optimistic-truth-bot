      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the outcome of the Carolina Hurricanes vs. Montreal Canadiens game on April 16, 2025. The key here is to determine the result of the game using the provided search results and apply the resolution conditions from the ancillary data.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current timestamp is April 17, 2025, which is after the game date of April 16. So the event has already occurred. The next step is to verify the outcome of the game from the search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the game. Source [1] is a box score from Fox Sports indicating the final score was Montreal Canadiens 3, Carolina Hurricanes 1. The play-by-play shows Montreal scoring three goals, including two in the second period and one in the third, while Carolina only managed one goal. \n\nSource [15] from ESPN's live score also confirms the final score as Canadiens 4, Hurricanes 2. However, there's a discrepancy here. Wait, let me check again. Source [15] shows a live score with the Canadiens winning 4-2, but the timestamps in the play-by-play are from the 3rd period. However, source [1] clearly states the final score as 3-1 for Montreal. This inconsistency needs resolving.\n\nLooking at other sources, source [14] mentions that Montreal needed one point to clinch a playoff spot and that Carolina was resting players. Source [16] also states that Montreal could clinch with a point and that they were in a must-win situation. Source [17] from Habs Eyes on the Prize details that the Canadiens earned a point in their previous game and needed one more to secure the playoff spot. \n\nWait, source [15] might be a different game. Let me check the dates. Source [15] is from the ESPN game on April 16, 2025, and shows a final score of 4-2 for Montreal. However, source [1] from Fox Sports on the same date shows a 3-1 Montreal win. This is conflicting. Which one is accurate?\n\nLooking deeper, source [1] provides a detailed box score with specific penalties and goals, including a goal by K. Guhle and N. Suzuki. Source [15] lists different goal scorers, like Jake Evans and Tyson Jost. This suggests that there might be two different games referenced. However, the user's query is specifically about the April 16 game. \n\nWait, source [9] is an ESPN game from February 25, 2025, where Montreal won 4-0. That's a different date. Source [12] is another game from February 25. So those are not relevant here. \n\nSource [15] is labeled as \"Hurricanes vs. Canadiens (Apr 16, 2025) Live Score - ESPN\" and shows a 4-2 Montreal win. Source [1] from Fox Sports also on April 16 shows a 3-1 Montreal win. This discrepancy is confusing. How can there be two different scores for the same game?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the sources. Let me cross-reference. Source [17] from Habs Eyes on the Prize mentions the game on April 16 as the final regular-season game where Montreal needed a point to clinch. It references a previous game where they tied with a power-play goal by Slafkovsky, but that's from an earlier game. The key point is that the April 16 game's result is critical.\n\nLooking at source [1], the Fox Sports box score clearly states the final score as CAR 1, MTL 3. The play-by-play shows Montreal scoring three goals, and Carolina one. This seems definitive. Source [15] on ESPN might be an error or a different game, but given the date in the URL and the context, it's likely the same game. However, the ESPN source shows a 4-2 score. This inconsistency needs resolution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ESPN source [15] is a different instance, maybe a playoff game or another matchup. But the user's query is about the April 16 regular-season game. Given that source [1] is a box score specifically dated April 16, 2025, and details the goals and penalties, it's more reliable. Additionally, source [14] from Sports Betting Dime mentions that Montreal needed a point and Carolina was resting players, which aligns with the Fox Sports report of Montreal winning 3-1.\n\nTherefore, the most reliable information indicates that the Montreal Canadiens won the game on April 16, 2025, with a score of 3-1. This would mean the market resolves to \"Canadiens,\" corresponding to p1 in the ancillary data. The resolution conditions state that if Montreal wins, it's p1. Therefore, the recommendation should be p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744854380 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-17 01:46:20 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query.

Source [16] also states that Montreal could clinch with a point and that they were in a must-win situation. Source [17] from Habs Eyes on the Prize details that the Canadiens earned a point in their previous game and needed one more to secure the playoff spot. \n\nWait, source [15] might be a different game. Let me check the dates. Source [15] is from the ESPN game on April 16, 2025, and shows a final score of 4-2 for Montreal. However, source [1] from Fox Sports on the same date shows a 3-1 Montreal win. This is conflicting. Which one is accurate?\n\nLooking deeper, source [1] provides a detailed box score with specific penalties and goals, including a goal by K. Guhle and N. Suzuki. Source [15] lists different goal scorers, like Jake Evans and Tyson Jost. This suggests that there might be two different games referenced. However, the user's query is specifically about the April 16 game. \n\nWait, source [9] is an ESPN game from February 25, 2025, where Montreal won 4-0. That's a different date. Source [12] is another game from February 25. So those are not relevant here. \n\nSource [15] is labeled as \"Hurricanes vs. Canadiens (Apr 16, 2025) Live Score - ESPN\" and shows a 4-2 Montreal win. Source [1] from Fox Sports also on April 16 shows a 3-1 Montreal win. This discrepancy is confusing. How can there be two different scores for the same game?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the sources. Let me cross-reference. Source [17] from Habs Eyes on the Prize mentions the game on April 16 as the final regular-season game where Montreal needed a point to clinch. It references a previous game where they tied with a power-play goal by Slafkovsky, but that's from an earlier game. The key point is that the April 16 game's result is critical.\n\nLooking at source [1], the Fox Sports box score clearly states the final score as CAR 1, MTL 3. The play-by-play shows Montreal scoring three goals, and Carolina one. This seems definitive. Source [15] on ESPN might be an error or a different game, but given the date in the URL and the context, it's likely the same game. However, the ESPN source shows a 4-2 score. This inconsistency needs resolution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ESPN source [15] is a different instance, maybe a playoff game or another matchup. But the user's query is about the April 16 regular-season game. Given that source [1] is a box score specifically dated April 16, 2025, and details the goals and penalties, it's more reliable. Additionally, source [14] from Sports Betting Dime mentions that Montreal needed a point and Carolina was resting players, which aligns with the Fox Sports report of Montreal winning 3-1.\n\nTherefore, the most reliable information indicates that the Montreal Canadiens won the game on April 16, 2025, with a score of 3-1. This would mean the market resolves to \"Canadiens,\" corresponding to p1 in the ancillary data. The resolution conditions state that if Montreal wins, it's p1. Therefore, the recommendation should be p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Hurricanes, Price: 0.11, ID: 107944170160741363705800430634384685663882940355713033638480380407958687769979, Winner: No\n- Token: Canadiens, Price: 0.89, ID: 32802437259986970770200594870062822857323268084866308564772599368890070744723, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Canadiens, p2 to Hurricanes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Canadiens, p2 = Hurricanes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Canadiens outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.890 = 89.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
