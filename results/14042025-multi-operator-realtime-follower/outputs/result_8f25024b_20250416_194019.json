      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump will say the word \"Deranged\" between April 12 and April 18, 2025. The resolution depends on any verbal mention in a recorded and publicly accessible audio or video. Written statements don't count.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is April 16, 2025. The event window is from April 12 to April 18, so we're in the middle of that period. The user provided several search results, so I'll go through each to see if there's any mention of Trump using \"Deranged\" verbally during this timeframe.\n\nLooking at the search results:\n\n1. **Result [5]**: From March 14, 2025, Trump calls opponents 'scum' and refers to \"deranged Jack Smith.\" This is within the DOJ speech. However, March 14 is outside the April 12-18 window, so this doesn't count.\n\n2. **Result [11]**: Also from March 14, 2025, Trump mentions \"deranged Jack Smith\" again. Same issue as above\u2014wrong dates.\n\n3. **Result [9]**: A YouTube video from April 11, 2025, discussing Trump's behavior. The transcript mentions Trump confusing \"insane asylums\" and \"political asylum,\" but the term \"deranged\" isn't used by Trump himself here. The video's date is April 11, which is just before the window starts, so it's excluded.\n\n4. **Result [12]**: An opinion piece from April 12, 2025, mentions mental health professionals calling Trump deranged, but this is written, not a verbal mention by Trump. Doesn't count.\n\n5. **Result [16]**: CBS News article from April 2, 2025, about tariffs. No mention of \"deranged\" by Trump in the provided snippet.\n\n6. **Result [7]**: March 20, 2025, article about tariffs. Trump's speech here uses \"Liberation Day\" but no \"deranged.\"\n\n7. **Result [8]**: March 5, 2025, opinion piece. Mentions Trump's speech being deranged but not him using the word.\n\n8. **Result [10]**: July 2024 RNC speech. Too old and outside the date range.\n\n9. **Result [13]**: Travel timeline up to April 13. No mentions of speeches with \"deranged.\"\n\n10. **Result [14]**: March 25, 2025, about tariffs. No relevant mentions.\n\n11. **Result [15]**: Timeline up to March 31, 2025. Outside the window.\n\n12. **Result [3]**: October 21, 2024. Too early.\n\n13. **Result [4]**: March 13, 2025. Written letter, not verbal.\n\n14. **Result [6]**: March 5, 2025, YouTube video. Transcript doesn't show Trump saying \"deranged.\"\n\n15. **Result [2]**: September 23, 2024. Outside the date range.\n\n16. **Result [1]**: Wikipedia on Trump derangement syndrome. General info, no specific events in April 2025.\n\nAfter reviewing all sources, there's no evidence that Trump verbally said \"Deranged\" between April 12-18, 2025. The latest mentions of him using the term are from March 14, which is outside the window. The user's current date is April 16, so the event is still ongoing, but based on available data up to now, there's no confirmation. However, since the event window hasn't closed yet (ends April 18), there's a possibility he might say it in the remaining days. But according to the rules, if the event is ongoing and no info is available, we assume the most probable outcome. Given the lack of recent mentions and his recent focus on tariffs and other topics, it's more likely \"No.\" But since the window isn't closed, there's some uncertainty. However, the ancillary data specifies p3 for unknown/50-50, but the instructions say if the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp (which it's not fully yet), but since the current date is April 16 and the event is ongoing, but the user is asking now, perhaps the resolution should be based on available info up to now. Wait, the current timestamp is April 16, 2025, 7:36 PM UTC. The event ends on April 18, so two days remaining. Since the user is asking now, before the end date, but the resolution conditions say if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, return p4. Wait, the instructions say: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.\"\n\nWait, the event's end date is April 18, 11:59 PM ET. The current timestamp is April 16, 7:36 PM UTC, which is April 16, 3:36 PM ET. So there are still two days left in the event window. Since the event hasn't concluded yet, according to the instructions, we should return p4. But the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" Wait, the event is ongoing, not fully in the past. The current date is during the event period. Therefore, since the event hasn't concluded, we can't confirm yet, so the resolution should be p4. But the user's query is asking to resolve now, but the event is still ongoing. However, the instructions say: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp... ALWAYS return p4.\" Since part of the event is in the future (from April 16 to April 18), the event is still ongoing, so it's considered future. Therefore, the correct resolution is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

The user wants to know if Donald Trump will say the word \"Deranged\" between April 12 and April 18, 2025. The resolution depends on any verbal mention in a recorded and publicly accessible audio or video. Written statements don't count.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is April 16, 2025. The event window is from April 12 to April 18, so we're in the middle of that period. The user provided several search results, so I'll go through each to see if there's any mention of Trump using \"Deranged\" verbally during this timeframe.\n\nLooking at the search results:\n\n1. **Result [5]**: From March 14, 2025, Trump calls opponents 'scum' and refers to \"deranged Jack Smith.\" This is within the DOJ speech. However, March 14 is outside the April 12-18 window, so this doesn't count.\n\n2. **Result [11]**: Also from March 14, 2025, Trump mentions \"deranged Jack Smith\" again. Same issue as above\u2014wrong dates.\n\n3. **Result [9]**: A YouTube video from April 11, 2025, discussing Trump's behavior. The transcript mentions Trump confusing \"insane asylums\" and \"political asylum,\" but the term \"deranged\" isn't used by Trump himself here. The video's date is April 11, which is just before the window starts, so it's excluded.\n\n4. **Result [12]**: An opinion piece from April 12, 2025, mentions mental health professionals calling Trump deranged, but this is written, not a verbal mention by Trump. Doesn't count.\n\n5. **Result [16]**: CBS News article from April 2, 2025, about tariffs. No mention of \"deranged\" by Trump in the provided snippet.\n\n6. **Result [7]**: March 20, 2025, article about tariffs. Trump's speech here uses \"Liberation Day\" but no \"deranged.\"\n\n7. **Result [8]**: March 5, 2025, opinion piece. Mentions Trump's speech being deranged but not him using the word.\n\n8. **Result [10]**: July 2024 RNC speech. Too old and outside the date range.\n\n9. **Result [13]**: Travel timeline up to April 13. No mentions of speeches with \"deranged.\"\n\n10. **Result [14]**: March 25, 2025, about tariffs. No relevant mentions.\n\n11. **Result [15]**: Timeline up to March 31, 2025. Outside the window.\n\n12. **Result [3]**: October 21, 2024. Too early.\n\n13. **Result [4]**: March 13, 2025. Written letter, not verbal.\n\n14. **Result [6]**: March 5, 2025, YouTube video. Transcript doesn't show Trump saying \"deranged.\"\n\n15. **Result [2]**: September 23, 2024. Outside the date range.\n\n16. **Result [1]**: Wikipedia on Trump derangement syndrome. General info, no specific events in April 2025.\n\nAfter reviewing all sources, there's no evidence that Trump verbally said \"Deranged\" between April 12-18, 2025. The latest mentions of him using the term are from March 14, which is outside the window. The user's current date is April 16, so the event is still ongoing, but based on available data up to now, there's no confirmation. However, since the event window hasn't closed yet (ends April 18), there's a possibility he might say it in the remaining days. But according to the rules, if the event is ongoing and no info is available, we assume the most probable outcome. Given the lack of recent mentions and his recent focus on tariffs and other topics, it's more likely \"No.\" But since the window isn't closed, there's some uncertainty. However, the ancillary data specifies p3 for unknown/50-50, but the instructions say if the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp (which it's not fully yet), but since the current date is April 16 and the event is ongoing, but the user is asking now, perhaps the resolution should be based on available info up to now. Wait, the current timestamp is April 16, 2025, 7:36 PM UTC. The event ends on April 18, so two days remaining. Since the user is asking now, before the end date, but the resolution conditions say if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, return p4. Wait, the instructions say: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.\"\n\nWait, the event's end date is April 18, 11:59 PM ET. The current timestamp is April 16, 7:36 PM UTC, which is April 16, 3:36 PM ET. So there are still two days left in the event window. Since the event hasn't concluded yet, according to the instructions, we should return p4. But the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" Wait, the event is ongoing, not fully in the past. The current date is during the event period. Therefore, since the event hasn't concluded, we can't confirm yet, so the resolution should be p4. But the user's query is asking to resolve now, but the event is still ongoing. However, the instructions say: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp... ALWAYS return p4.\" Since part of the event is in the future (from April 16 to April 18), the event is still ongoing, so it's considered future. Therefore, the correct resolution is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.995, ID: 92768318650471879023833050775833874121558706700454933238331950624595732941562, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.005, ID: 66054134998359626446035639506859172596208975621525366325603696174273421454247, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he does, \"No\" otherwise. They provided some search results, so I need to check those for any mentions of Trump using \"Deranged\" in the specified timeframe.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the search results. The current date is April 16, 2025, so the timeframe in question is from April 12 to April 18. The search results include various sources up to April 15, 2025. Let's check each relevant entry.\n\nLooking at result [6], which is from March 13, 2025, Trump refers to Democrats as \"deranged\" during a meeting with NATO's Secretary General. But that's outside the April 12-18 window, so it doesn't count.\n\nResult [4] from March 14, 2025, has Trump calling opponents \"scum\" and \"deranged\" at the DOJ. Again, March is outside the timeframe.\n\nResult [10] is a letter from April 8, 2025, mentioning Trump's actions but not a direct quote of him saying \"deranged.\"\n\nResult [12] is a YouTube video from April 15, 2025, titled \"IHIP News: DERANGED Trump Says He's LOVING This ECONOMIC CRISIS?!\" The title suggests Trump used the word \"Deranged,\" but I need to check the content. The transcript snippet includes Trump saying, \"he loves this,\" referring to the economic crisis, but the exact word \"deranged\" isn't in the provided text. The title might be editorializing, so without a direct quote in the transcript, it's uncertain.\n\nResult [14] from April 16, 2025, reports Trump commenting on a missile strike in Ukraine. He calls the attackers \"completely deranged scum.\" The exact phrase \"deranged\" is used here, and the date is within the timeframe. This seems to be a valid instance.\n\nResult [13] from April 13, 2025, mentions Trump's \"deranged lust for revenge\" in a Daily Kos article, but that's the author's description, not a direct quote from Trump.\n\nResult [7] from March 12, 2025, includes Trump's remarks, but again, outside the timeframe.\n\nResult [9] from March 20, 2025, discusses tariffs but doesn't have Trump using \"deranged.\"\n\nResult [15] from January 14, 2025, has Trump calling Jack Smith \"deranged,\" but that's way before April.\n\nSo the key here is result [14], where on April 16, 2025, Trump refers to the attackers as \"completely deranged scum.\" That's within the April 12-18 window and a direct verbal mention. The Politico.eu article confirms the statement was made on April 16. Since the market resolution depends on any verbal mention recorded and publicly accessible, this should qualify as a \"Yes.\"\n\nI need to ensure there's a video or audio recording of this statement. The source is Politico.eu, which is a reputable outlet, and they quote Trump directly. Assuming they have a recording, this would meet the criteria. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

This seems to be a valid instance.\n\nResult [13] from April 13, 2025, mentions Trump's \"deranged lust for revenge\" in a Daily Kos article, but that's the author's description, not a direct quote from Trump.\n\nResult [7] from March 12, 2025, includes Trump's remarks, but again, outside the timeframe.\n\nResult [9] from March 20, 2025, discusses tariffs but doesn't have Trump using \"deranged.\"\n\nResult [15] from January 14, 2025, has Trump calling Jack Smith \"deranged,\" but that's way before April.\n\nSo the key here is result [14], where on April 16, 2025, Trump refers to the attackers as \"completely deranged scum.\" That's within the April 12-18 window and a direct verbal mention. The Politico.eu article confirms the statement was made on April 16. Since the market resolution depends on any verbal mention recorded and publicly accessible, this should qualify as a \"Yes.\"\n\nI need to ensure there's a video or audio recording of this statement. The source is Politico.eu, which is a reputable outlet, and they quote Trump directly. Assuming they have a recording, this would meet the criteria. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.995, ID: 92768318650471879023833050775833874121558706700454933238331950624595732941562, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.005, ID: 66054134998359626446035639506859172596208975621525366325603696174273421454247, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
