      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the March 2025 border encounters were below 28,654, which was the February 2025 number. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if March is lower, \"No\" otherwise. The resolution source is CBP's data.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for March 2025 data. Looking at the sources:\n\n- Source [1] is CBP's March 2025 report. It states that USBP apprehended 7,181 illegal aliens at the southwest border. The Office of Field Operations (OFO) had 673 daily encounters nationwide. To find the total March encounters, I need to calculate OFO's total: 673/day * 31 days = 20,863. Adding USBP's 7,181 gives 28,044 total encounters. That's below February's 28,654. \n\nBut wait, source [11] mentions February's nationwide encounters as 28,654, which includes both USBP and OFO. The March total from [1] would be 7,181 (USBP) + 20,863 (OFO) = 28,044, which is indeed lower than 28,654. \n\nHowever, I need to confirm if \"nationwide encounters\" in the query refers to the same metric. Source [9] explains that nationwide encounters include USBP apprehensions, OFO inadmissibles, and Title 42 expulsions. But Title 42 was ended in 2023, so it's likely just Title 8 now. \n\nLooking at source [6], it mentions OFO's daily encounters in March as 673, which over 31 days is 20,863. Adding USBP's 7,181 gives 28,044, which is less than February's 28,654. \n\nBut wait, source [11] says February's Southwest border encounters were 11,709, but nationwide was 28,654. The March Southwest numbers are 7,181 (USBP) + OFO's 3,362 (from source [4], but that's February). Wait, no\u2014source [1] says OFO's nationwide encounters in March were 673 per day, which would be 673*31=20,863. So nationwide would be USBP's 7,181 (southwest) plus other USBP sectors (northern, etc.) plus OFO's 20,863. But the query's ancillary data references the nationwide encounters from February as 28,654. For March, if USBP's total nationwide apprehensions were 7,181 (southwest) plus any others, but the report in [1] says USBP's nationwide daily apprehensions were 264/day, which is 264*31=8,184. Then OFO's 673/day*31=20,863. Total nationwide encounters would be 8,184 + 20,863 = 29,047, which is higher than February's 28,654. Wait, this contradicts.\n\nWait, source [1] says: \"USBP apprehended 7,181 illegal aliens crossing the southwest border between ports of entry.\" But USBP's nationwide apprehensions (including northern border) averaged 264/day, so 264*31=8,184. So nationwide USBP is 8,184, and OFO's encounters are 673/day*31=20,863. Total nationwide encounters would be 8,184 + 20,863 = 29,047, which is higher than February's 28,654. But the user's query says the February number is 28,654, and March needs to be lower. \n\nBut wait, the ancillary data says the February number is 28,654, and the market resolves based on March's number. If March's total is 29,047, that's higher, so the answer would be \"No\". But this conflicts with the initial calculation from source [1] where southwest USBP was 7,181 and OFO's nationwide was 20,863, totaling 28,044. But that's only if OFO's 20,863 is the nationwide number and USBP's 7,181 is just southwest. However, the nationwide encounters include all USBP sectors, not just southwest. So the USBP nationwide number in March is 264/day *31=8,184, and OFO's is 673/day*31=20,863, totaling 29,047. That's higher than February's 28,654, so the answer would be \"No\". \n\nBut wait, source [1] says \"USBP apprehended 7,181 illegal aliens crossing the southwest border between ports of entry.\" That's just the southwest USBP number. The nationwide USBP would include other sectors. For example, in February, source [4] says USBP nationwide apprehensions averaged 330/day, which is 330*28=9,240, but they reported 8,347 in southwest. So nationwide USBP would be higher than southwest. Similarly, in March, USBP's nationwide daily apprehensions were 264, so 264*31=8,184 nationwide, of which 7,181 were southwest. So the rest (8,184 -7,181=1,003) would be from other sectors. Then OFO's encounters are 20,863 nationwide. Total encounters would be 8,184 (USBP) +20,863 (OFO) =29,047, which is higher than February's 28,654. Therefore, March's total is higher, so the answer is \"No\". \n\nBut the user's query says the market resolves based on the first report of data for March. The first report is source [1], which was released on April 14, 2025. According to that, the total nationwide encounters would be USBP's 8,184 plus OFO's 20,863, totaling 29,047, which is higher than February's 28,654. Therefore, the answer should be \"No\", corresponding to p1. \n\nBut wait, the ancillary data says the market resolves to \"Yes\" if March is less than February's 28,654. If the March total is 29,047, then it's higher, so \"No\". But maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me check again. \n\nSource [1] states: \"USBP apprehended 7,181 illegal aliens crossing the southwest border between ports of entry.\" That's just the southwest USBP number. The nationwide USBP apprehensions are mentioned as averaging 264 per day, which is 264*31=8,184. So nationwide USBP is 8,184. OFO's encounters are 673 per day nationwide, so 673*31=20,863. Total nationwide encounters would be 8,184 +20,863=29,047. February's total was 28,654. Therefore, March is higher, so the answer is \"No\" (p1). \n\nHowever, source [6] repeats the same numbers as [1], and source [3] also mentions 7,181 for USBP southwest. Source [5] says 7,181, which is southwest USBP. So the total nationwide would indeed be higher when including all USBP sectors and OFO. Therefore, the March number is higher than February's, so the resolution is \"No\", p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

If no data is posted for Mar 2025 (FYTD) by June 30, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThe resolution source is United States Customs and Border Protection (see: https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/nationwide-encounters)\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744731457 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-15 15:37:37 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the March 2025 border encounters were below 28,654, which was the February 2025 number. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if March is lower, \"No\" otherwise. The resolution source is CBP's data.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for March 2025 data. Looking at the sources:\n\n- Source [1] is CBP's March 2025 report. It states that USBP apprehended 7,181 illegal aliens at the southwest border. The Office of Field Operations (OFO) had 673 daily encounters nationwide. To find the total March encounters, I need to calculate OFO's total: 673/day * 31 days = 20,863. Adding USBP's 7,181 gives 28,044 total encounters. That's below February's 28,654. \n\nBut wait, source [11] mentions February's nationwide encounters as 28,654, which includes both USBP and OFO. The March total from [1] would be 7,181 (USBP) + 20,863 (OFO) = 28,044, which is indeed lower than 28,654. \n\nHowever, I need to confirm if \"nationwide encounters\" in the query refers to the same metric. Source [9] explains that nationwide encounters include USBP apprehensions, OFO inadmissibles, and Title 42 expulsions. But Title 42 was ended in 2023, so it's likely just Title 8 now. \n\nLooking at source [6], it mentions OFO's daily encounters in March as 673, which over 31 days is 20,863. Adding USBP's 7,181 gives 28,044, which is less than February's 28,654. \n\nBut wait, source [11] says February's Southwest border encounters were 11,709, but nationwide was 28,654. The March Southwest numbers are 7,181 (USBP) + OFO's 3,362 (from source [4], but that's February). Wait, no\u2014source [1] says OFO's nationwide encounters in March were 673 per day, which would be 673*31=20,863. So nationwide would be USBP's 7,181 (southwest) plus other USBP sectors (northern, etc.) plus OFO's 20,863. But the query's ancillary data references the nationwide encounters from February as 28,654. For March, if USBP's total nationwide apprehensions were 7,181 (southwest) plus any others, but the report in [1] says USBP's nationwide daily apprehensions were 264/day, which is 264*31=8,184. Then OFO's 673/day*31=20,863. Total nationwide encounters would be 8,184 + 20,863 = 29,047, which is higher than February's 28,654. Wait, this contradicts.\n\nWait, source [1] says: \"USBP apprehended 7,181 illegal aliens crossing the southwest border between ports of entry.\" But USBP's nationwide apprehensions (including northern border) averaged 264/day, so 264*31=8,184. So nationwide USBP is 8,184, and OFO's encounters are 673/day*31=20,863. Total nationwide encounters would be 8,184 + 20,863 = 29,047, which is higher than February's 28,654. But the user's query says the February number is 28,654, and March needs to be lower. \n\nBut wait, the ancillary data says the February number is 28,654, and the market resolves based on March's number. If March's total is 29,047, that's higher, so the answer would be \"No\". But this conflicts with the initial calculation from source [1] where southwest USBP was 7,181 and OFO's nationwide was 20,863, totaling 28,044. But that's only if OFO's 20,863 is the nationwide number and USBP's 7,181 is just southwest. However, the nationwide encounters include all USBP sectors, not just southwest. So the USBP nationwide number in March is 264/day *31=8,184, and OFO's is 673/day*31=20,863, totaling 29,047. That's higher than February's 28,654, so the answer would be \"No\". \n\nBut wait, source [1] says \"USBP apprehended 7,181 illegal aliens crossing the southwest border between ports of entry.\" That's just the southwest USBP number. The nationwide USBP would include other sectors. For example, in February, source [4] says USBP nationwide apprehensions averaged 330/day, which is 330*28=9,240, but they reported 8,347 in southwest. So nationwide USBP would be higher than southwest. Similarly, in March, USBP's nationwide daily apprehensions were 264, so 264*31=8,184 nationwide, of which 7,181 were southwest. So the rest (8,184 -7,181=1,003) would be from other sectors. Then OFO's encounters are 20,863 nationwide. Total encounters would be 8,184 (USBP) +20,863 (OFO) =29,047, which is higher than February's 28,654. Therefore, March's total is higher, so the answer is \"No\". \n\nBut the user's query says the market resolves based on the first report of data for March. The first report is source [1], which was released on April 14, 2025. According to that, the total nationwide encounters would be USBP's 8,184 plus OFO's 20,863, totaling 29,047, which is higher than February's 28,654. Therefore, the answer should be \"No\", corresponding to p1. \n\nBut wait, the ancillary data says the market resolves to \"Yes\" if March is less than February's 28,654. If the March total is 29,047, then it's higher, so \"No\". But maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me check again. \n\nSource [1] states: \"USBP apprehended 7,181 illegal aliens crossing the southwest border between ports of entry.\" That's just the southwest USBP number. The nationwide USBP apprehensions are mentioned as averaging 264 per day, which is 264*31=8,184. So nationwide USBP is 8,184. OFO's encounters are 673 per day nationwide, so 673*31=20,863. Total nationwide encounters would be 8,184 +20,863=29,047. February's total was 28,654. Therefore, March is higher, so the answer is \"No\" (p1). \n\nHowever, source [6] repeats the same numbers as [1], and source [3] also mentions 7,181 for USBP southwest. Source [5] says 7,181, which is southwest USBP. So the total nationwide would indeed be higher when including all USBP sectors and OFO. Therefore, the March number is higher than February's, so the resolution is \"No\", p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.765, ID: 50460956261204798908381212372811516778370033106037541767827145567110869865797, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.235, ID: 24636437954051629934126584540627942830322907472276536445986719971883660495057, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors YES outcome (0.765 = 76.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.
