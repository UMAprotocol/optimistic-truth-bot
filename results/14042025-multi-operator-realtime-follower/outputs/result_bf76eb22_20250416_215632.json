      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump said the word \"Elon\" during his FOX Noticias interview on April 15 and 16, 2025. The resolution depends on whether the term was used, considering pluralization, possessive, or compound words, but not other forms. If the interview was canceled or not aired by the deadline, it resolves to \"No\".\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mention of the interview in question. The search results include several sources about Trump's interviews, especially with Elon Musk and others. The key sources here are [9], [10], [11], [12], [14], [15], and [16], which discuss the FOX Noticias interview with Rachel Campos-Duffy.\n\nLooking at [9], it's a press release from FOX News about the interview, mentioning topics like tariffs, economy, immigration, and the border. However, there's no transcript or mention of Trump saying \"Elon\" here. \n\nSource [10] details the interview where Campos-Duffy tried to teach Trump Spanish phrases. It includes discussions about El Salvador's president and tariffs but no mention of Elon Musk or the term \"Elon\".\n\nSource [11] from Axios confirms the interview's scheduling and topics but again doesn't mention Elon Musk being discussed.\n\nSource [12] talks about a viral clip where Trump attempted to say \"Make America Great Again\" in Spanish. No reference to \"Elon\" here either.\n\nSources [14] and [15] focus on Trump's comments about sending criminals to El Salvador and tariffs. Again, no mention of Elon Musk or the term \"Elon\".\n\nThe interview in question is with Rachel Campos-Duffy, not Elon Musk. The search results provided don't indicate any involvement of Elon Musk in this particular interview. All mentions of Elon Musk in the search results are related to previous interviews, like the one with Sean Hannity in February 2025. \n\nSince the current interview is with Campos-Duffy and the topics are tariffs, immigration, and El Salvador, it's unlikely that Trump would mention \"Elon\" in this context. Additionally, none of the provided sources mention Trump saying \"Elon\" during the FOX Noticias interview. \n\nThe user also specified that if the interview wasn't released by the deadline, it resolves to \"No\". The interview was scheduled for April 15 and 16, and sources [9], [11], and [12] confirm it aired as planned. Therefore, the resolution is based on the content aired. \n\nGiven the absence of any mention of \"Elon\" in the provided context for this specific interview, the resolution should be \"No\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The user wants to know if Donald Trump said the word \"Elon\" during his FOX Noticias interview on April 15 and 16, 2025. The resolution depends on whether the term was used, considering pluralization, possessive, or compound words, but not other forms. If the interview was canceled or not aired by the deadline, it resolves to \"No\".\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mention of the interview in question. The search results include several sources about Trump's interviews, especially with Elon Musk and others. The key sources here are [9], [10], [11], [12], [14], [15], and [16], which discuss the FOX Noticias interview with Rachel Campos-Duffy.\n\nLooking at [9], it's a press release from FOX News about the interview, mentioning topics like tariffs, economy, immigration, and the border. However, there's no transcript or mention of Trump saying \"Elon\" here. \n\nSource [10] details the interview where Campos-Duffy tried to teach Trump Spanish phrases. It includes discussions about El Salvador's president and tariffs but no mention of Elon Musk or the term \"Elon\".\n\nSource [11] from Axios confirms the interview's scheduling and topics but again doesn't mention Elon Musk being discussed.\n\nSource [12] talks about a viral clip where Trump attempted to say \"Make America Great Again\" in Spanish. No reference to \"Elon\" here either.\n\nSources [14] and [15] focus on Trump's comments about sending criminals to El Salvador and tariffs. Again, no mention of Elon Musk or the term \"Elon\".\n\nThe interview in question is with Rachel Campos-Duffy, not Elon Musk. The search results provided don't indicate any involvement of Elon Musk in this particular interview. All mentions of Elon Musk in the search results are related to previous interviews, like the one with Sean Hannity in February 2025. \n\nSince the current interview is with Campos-Duffy and the topics are tariffs, immigration, and El Salvador, it's unlikely that Trump would mention \"Elon\" in this context. Additionally, none of the provided sources mention Trump saying \"Elon\" during the FOX Noticias interview. \n\nThe user also specified that if the interview wasn't released by the deadline, it resolves to \"No\". The interview was scheduled for April 15 and 16, and sources [9], [11], and [12] confirm it aired as planned. Therefore, the resolution is based on the content aired. \n\nGiven the absence of any mention of \"Elon\" in the provided context for this specific interview, the resolution should be \"No\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.99, ID: 111352997488707819119845127149668345929981692565388602762071456906346489555424, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.01, ID: 104658811422942797022476289923776739414226738060349313046277386434600187783123, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.990 = 99.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The search results include several interviews, including the one with Campos-Duffy. Let's look through each relevant source.\n\nLooking at the search results, most of them discuss Trump's interactions with Elon Musk, especially their joint interviews and Musk's role in the administration. However, the specific interview in question here is the one with Rachel Campos-Duffy. The search results 12, 13, 14, and 15 mention this interview. \n\nIn search result 12, the transcript excerpt shows Campos-Duffy teaching Trump to say \"Make America Great Again\" in Spanish. There's no mention of \"Elon\" here. Similarly, search result 13 discusses tariffs and transferring prisoners, but no mention of Elon. Search result 14 also covers the same interview, focusing on the Spanish lesson and other topics, but again, no reference to Elon Musk. Search result 15 is a press release about the interview but doesn't mention Elon.\n\nOther search results (1-11, 16-17) discuss Trump's interactions with Musk in other contexts, like their joint interview with Sean Hannity. However, the query specifically asks about the Campos-Duffy interview. Since the user provided the link to the press release (search result 15) which doesn't mention Elon, and the actual interview excerpts (12-14) also don't mention Elon, it's likely that Trump didn't say \"Elon\" during this particular interview. \n\nAdditionally, the user's note mentions that if the interview isn't released by the deadline, it resolves to \"No\". The current date is April 16, 2025, and the interview was scheduled for April 15 and 16. The search results don't indicate any cancellation, so we assume it aired. Since there's no evidence of Trump saying \"Elon\" in the Campos-Duffy interview, the resolution should be \"No\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744839650 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-16 21:40:50 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Re-evaluate the available information or seek additional sources that might explain the strong market sentiment favoring 'Yes'. Consider potential errors or omissions in the initial analysis.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump will say \"Elon\" during his FOX Noticias interview with Rachel Campos-Duffy on April 15 and 16, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he does, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mentions of Trump saying \"Elon\" in the interviews. The search results include several interviews, including the one with Campos-Duffy. Let's look through each relevant source.\n\nLooking at the search results, most of them discuss Trump's interactions with Elon Musk, especially their joint interviews and Musk's role in the administration. However, the specific interview in question here is the one with Rachel Campos-Duffy. The search results 12, 13, 14, and 15 mention this interview. \n\nIn search result 12, the transcript excerpt shows Campos-Duffy teaching Trump to say \"Make America Great Again\" in Spanish. There's no mention of \"Elon\" here. Similarly, search result 13 discusses tariffs and transferring prisoners, but no mention of Elon. Search result 14 also covers the same interview, focusing on the Spanish lesson and other topics, but again, no reference to Elon Musk. Search result 15 is a press release about the interview but doesn't mention Elon.\n\nOther search results (1-11, 16-17) discuss Trump's interactions with Musk in other contexts, like their joint interview with Sean Hannity. However, the query specifically asks about the Campos-Duffy interview. Since the user provided the link to the press release (search result 15) which doesn't mention Elon, and the actual interview excerpts (12-14) also don't mention Elon, it's likely that Trump didn't say \"Elon\" during this particular interview. \n\nAdditionally, the user's note mentions that if the interview isn't released by the deadline, it resolves to \"No\". The current date is April 16, 2025, and the interview was scheduled for April 15 and 16. The search results don't indicate any cancellation, so we assume it aired. Since there's no evidence of Trump saying \"Elon\" in the Campos-Duffy interview, the resolution should be \"No\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.99, ID: 111352997488707819119845127149668345929981692565388602762071456906346489555424, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.01, ID: 104658811422942797022476289923776739414226738060349313046277386434600187783123, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.990 = 99.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Therefore, it doesn't count towards this market's resolution.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.99, ID: 111352997488707819119845127149668345929981692565388602762071456906346489555424, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.01, ID: 104658811422942797022476289923776739414226738060349313046277386434600187783123, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.990 = 99.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3.

However, the specific FOX Noticias interview with Rachel Campos-Duffy is mentioned in sources [8], [9], [11], and [12]. \n\nLooking at source [8], it's an article from The Independent about Trump's interview on Fox Deportes. It mentions that Trump was taught to say \"Make America Great Again\" in Spanish but doesn't mention \"Elon.\" Source [9] from Axios confirms the interview's scheduling but doesn't provide a transcript. Source [11] is a press release from Fox News stating that a transcript would be available after the interview, but the provided text cuts off.

The current date in the context is April 16, 2025, 9:56 PM UTC, so the interview should have already aired. However, none of the provided search results include a transcript or specific mentions of Trump saying \"Elon\" during this particular interview. The available sources focus on earlier interviews, especially the February 2025 Hannity interview.\n\nSince the resolution source is the audio/video of the interview, and the provided search results don't include the transcript or any evidence of Trump saying \"Elon\" in the April interview, I can't confirm that he did. The absence of evidence in the provided sources suggests that the answer is \"No.\" However, the user mentioned that the market sentiment favors \"Yes,\" so I need to double-check if there's any overlooked information.\n\nReviewing again, sources [8] and [9] discuss the content of the April interview, like tariffs and immigration, but no mention of Musk or \"Elon.\" The other sources about Trump and Musk are from February. Without the actual transcript or a direct citation from the April interview mentioning \"Elon,\" I can't validate the \"Yes\" outcome.

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.990 = 99.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

Your task is to analyze the provided query and decide which AI solver is best suited to handle it.\n\nAvailable solvers: code_runner\n\nSolver descriptions:\n- perplexity: Uses the Perplexity AI search engine to find information online to answer general questions. Best for:\n  * Historical data and events\n  * General knowledge questions requiring context\n  * Questions needing interpretation of complex information\n  * Has knowledge cutoff and may not have very recent information\n\n- code_runner: Executes code to fetch real-time data from specific APIs. Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Currently available data sources based on API keys:\n    - MLB (Major League Baseball) data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Will Trump say \"Elon\" during his FOX Noticias interview?, description: Donald Trump is scheduled to sit for a two-part interview with Rachel Campos-Duffy which will be released on April 15 and 16, 2025. You can read more about that here: https://press.foxnews.com/2025/04/fox-noticias-to-present-an-exclusive-interview-with-president-donald-trump-on-april-15-and-16\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Donald Trump says the listed term during this interview. Otherwise, the market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nAny usage of the term regardless of context will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nPluralization/possessive of the term will count toward the resolution of this market, however other forms will NOT count.\n\nInstances where the term is used in a compound word will count regardless of context (e.g. joyful is not a compound word for \"joy,\" however \"killjoy\" is a compounding of the words \"kill\" and \"joy\").\n\nIf this interview is definitively cancelled by Trump or Fox, or otherwise is not released by April 16, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"No\". If the interview has not aired in its entirety by April 16, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve based on what has aired up to that point.\n\nThe resolution source will be audio/video of the interview.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe perplexity solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: perplexity\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744839650 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-16 21:40:50 UTC",
