For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), NHL hockey games (e.g., \"Who won the Maple Leafs vs Bruins game?\" or \"Did the Kraken beat the Golden Knights?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n"

The key sources here are the YouTube videos and news articles that might include direct quotes or summaries of his remarks.\n\nLooking at the search results, source [12] is a YouTube video titled \"Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025\" which likely contains the actual footage or transcript.

However, they do mention topics related to immigration, deportation, and border security, which are contexts where Trump might use the word \"border.\"\n\nFor example, in source [5], Trump is quoted discussing the southern border: \"Bukele told Mr. Trump what he's doing with the border is 'remarkable,' praising the plunge in crossings at the U.S. southern border.\" This indicates that the border was a topic of discussion, and Trump might have used the term multiple times.\n\nSource [9] mentions Bukele referring to Trump's efforts on the border, which could have prompted Trump to respond with the term. Additionally, source [10] includes a letter from Trump to Bukele where he writes about the southern border being an \"open door,\" which might have been reiterated during the meeting.\n\nHowever, without a full transcript, it's challenging to count exact mentions. The user's ancillary data specifies that the resolution source is the event's video. Since the provided search results don't include a full transcript, I have to infer based on the context. \n\nGiven the meeting's focus on immigration and deportation, it's plausible that Trump mentioned \"border\" multiple times. However, reaching 10 instances is uncertain. The news articles highlight the border's importance in their discussions but don't specify the exact count. \n\nSince the user's instructions state that if no verifiable information is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The event's context heavily involves border issues, making it likely that Trump used the term frequently. However, without explicit evidence of 10+ mentions, there's uncertainty. \n\nBut considering the emphasis on border security in the discussions and Trump's known rhetoric, it's reasonable to infer he met the threshold.

The user wants to know if Donald Trump said the word \"Border\" 10 or more times during his meeting with Nayib Bukele on April 14, 2025. The resolution depends on counting each instance of the term \"border\" (including plural or possessive forms) during the specified events.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any transcripts or mentions of Trump's speeches during that meeting. The key sources here are the YouTube videos and news articles that might include direct quotes or summaries of his remarks.\n\nLooking at the search results, source [12] is a YouTube video titled \"Donald Trump Holds a Bilateral Meeting with Nayib Bukele of El Salvador - April 14, 2025\" which likely contains the actual footage or transcript. The description mentions a transcript and analysis link, but since I can't access external links, I have to rely on the provided context.\n\nOther sources like [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [8], [9], [10], and [11] discuss the meeting but don't provide a verbatim transcript. However, they do mention topics related to immigration, deportation, and border security, which are contexts where Trump might use the word \"border.\"\n\nFor example, in source [5], Trump is quoted discussing the southern border: \"Bukele told Mr. Trump what he's doing with the border is 'remarkable,' praising the plunge in crossings at the U.S. southern border.\" This indicates that the border was a topic of discussion, and Trump might have used the term multiple times.\n\nSource [9] mentions Bukele referring to Trump's efforts on the border, which could have prompted Trump to respond with the term. Additionally, source [10] includes a letter from Trump to Bukele where he writes about the southern border being an \"open door,\" which might have been reiterated during the meeting.\n\nHowever, without a full transcript, it's challenging to count exact mentions. The user's ancillary data specifies that the resolution source is the event's video. Since the provided search results don't include a full transcript, I have to infer based on the context. \n\nGiven the meeting's focus on immigration and deportation, it's plausible that Trump mentioned \"border\" multiple times. However, reaching 10 instances is uncertain. The news articles highlight the border's importance in their discussions but don't specify the exact count. \n\nSince the user's instructions state that if no verifiable information is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The event's context heavily involves border issues, making it likely that Trump used the term frequently. However, without explicit evidence of 10+ mentions, there's uncertainty. \n\nBut considering the emphasis on border security in the discussions and Trump's known rhetoric, it's reasonable to infer he met the threshold. Therefore, the recommendation would be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.0045, ID: 7647573729413843368128932881958086641222957769832352438776337833144696828522, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.9955, ID: 67871839957674803175921886062441011433200176373580468170707147148516763231726, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (0.996 = 99.6% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nIf the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n"
