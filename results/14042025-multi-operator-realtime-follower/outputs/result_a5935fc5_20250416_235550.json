      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump will say the word \"Faith\" during his Easter Dinner on April 16, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he does, \"No\" otherwise. The event is specifically the Easter Dinner at the White House, and any usage of \"Faith\" in any context, including plural or possessive forms, counts. Compound words with \"Faith\" also count, but other forms don't. If the event is canceled or not aired by the deadline, it resolves to \"No\".\n\nFirst, I need to check if the event happened as scheduled. The current date is April 16, 2025, and the event was supposed to take place today. Looking at the search results, there are multiple sources mentioning the Easter Dinner on April 16. For example, source [8] states that Trump is holding the dinner on April 16 at 6:30 PM, and source [4] mentions Kenneth Copeland attending the dinner on April 16. Source [3] also confirms the dinner on Wednesday night (April 16). So the event did occur as planned.\n\nNext, I need to verify if Trump attended and spoke at the event. Source [8] mentions Trump is expected to attend, and sources [3], [4], [7], and [11] all indicate his participation, including giving remarks. So he was present and spoke.\n\nNow, the critical part: did he say \"Faith\" during his appearance? The user provided search results include transcripts and reports from the event. Let's look through them. \n\nSource [8] is a live update but doesn't provide a transcript. However, other sources detail the content of Trump's speeches. Source [9] includes his Palm Sunday message where he mentions defending the Christian faith, but that's a different event. The Easter Dinner remarks are covered in sources [2], [7], and [11]. \n\nSource [2] quotes Trump's message: \"renews its promise to defend the Christian faith.\" However, this is from the Holy Week proclamation, not the dinner. Source [7] mentions the pre-Easter dinner on Wednesday (April 16) with remarks from Trump and musical performances.

It quotes him urging prayers for an \"outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon our beloved nation\" and mentions the White House Faith Office's role.

The user's ancillary data specifies that any usage of \"Faith\" during the event counts. The White House Faith Office is mentioned multiple times in the context of organizing the event (sources [1], [2], [5], [7], [9], [10], [11]). If Trump referred to the Faith Office during his remarks, that would count. For example, if he said something like \"I want to thank the Faith Office for organizing this,\" that would include \"Faith.\" \n\nSource [7] quotes Jennifer Korn from the Faith Office discussing the events, but does Trump mention it? Source [9] mentions the Faith Office in the context of planning, but again, not Trump's direct speech. \n\nWithout a direct quote, it's challenging. However, given that the Faith Office was a key part of the event's organization, and Trump's administration emphasized faith during Holy Week, it's plausible he mentioned \"Faith\" in his remarks. However, without explicit evidence from the dinner transcript, it's uncertain. \n\nBut according to the rules, if there's no verifiable information, we assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The user prompt's ancillary data says to resolve based on the event's occurrence and the terms used. Since the event happened, and Trump's administration focused heavily on faith, it's likely he mentioned \"Faith.\" However, the exact evidence is missing. \n\nWait, source [12] is a 2017 speech, irrelevant here. Source [15] is a YouTube video without a transcript. \n\nGiven the lack of direct evidence in the provided sources, but considering the emphasis on the Faith Office and Trump's previous statements, it's possible he said \"Faith.\" However, the resolution requires definitive proof. Since the sources don't explicitly state he used the word during the dinner, the safe answer would be \"No\" unless confirmed. \n\nBut wait, source [7] mentions that during the pre-Easter dinner, Trump gave remarks. The Faith Office's role was highlighted, and Trump's message included defending the Christian faith. If he said \"defend the Christian faith\" during the dinner, that includes \"faith.\" However, the source [7] says the proclamation was issued earlier. The dinner remarks might have reiterated that message. \n\nIf the user's query allows any mention of \"faith\" regardless of context, and Trump said \"defend the Christian faith\" during his dinner remarks, then that would count. But the sources don't specify whether he used that exact phrase during the dinner or in the earlier proclamation. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and the requirement for the resolution source to be the video, and the provided search results not confirming the exact usage during the dinner, the answer would be \"No\" due to lack of verifiable evidence. However, considering the context, it's a close call. But per the instructions, if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome.

Since the event's theme was faith, and Trump's administration emphasized it, it's likely he mentioned \"faith.\" However, the instructions say to be strict. If the exact word isn't confirmed in the dinner, it's \"No.\" \n\nBut the ancillary data says any usage counts. If the Faith Office was mentioned by Trump, that's \"Faith.\" For example, \"I want to thank the Faith Office...\" would count. But do the sources confirm that? Source [7] mentions the Faith Office's role but doesn't quote Trump mentioning it. \n\nTherefore, without explicit confirmation, the answer is \"No.\" But this is conflicting. Alternatively, if the term was used in the context of the Faith Office during the event, even if not by Trump, but the query specifies Trump's usage. \n\nGiven the strict rules, and lack of direct evidence in the provided sources, the resolution would be \"No.\" However, considering the high probability given the context, it's a tough call.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744847607 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-16 23:53:27 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump will say the word \"Faith\" during his Easter Dinner on April 16, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he does, \"No\" otherwise. The event is specifically the Easter Dinner at the White House, and any usage of \"Faith\" in any context, including plural or possessive forms, counts. Compound words with \"Faith\" also count, but other forms don't. If the event is canceled or not aired by the deadline, it resolves to \"No\".\n\nFirst, I need to check if the event happened as scheduled. The current date is April 16, 2025, and the event was supposed to take place today. Looking at the search results, there are multiple sources mentioning the Easter Dinner on April 16. For example, source [8] states that Trump is holding the dinner on April 16 at 6:30 PM, and source [4] mentions Kenneth Copeland attending the dinner on April 16. Source [3] also confirms the dinner on Wednesday night (April 16). So the event did occur as planned.\n\nNext, I need to verify if Trump attended and spoke at the event. Source [8] mentions Trump is expected to attend, and sources [3], [4], [7], and [11] all indicate his participation, including giving remarks. So he was present and spoke.\n\nNow, the critical part: did he say \"Faith\" during his appearance? The user provided search results include transcripts and reports from the event. Let's look through them. \n\nSource [8] is a live update but doesn't provide a transcript. However, other sources detail the content of Trump's speeches. Source [9] includes his Palm Sunday message where he mentions defending the Christian faith, but that's a different event. The Easter Dinner remarks are covered in sources [2], [7], and [11]. \n\nSource [2] quotes Trump's message: \"renews its promise to defend the Christian faith.\" However, this is from the Holy Week proclamation, not the dinner. Source [7] mentions the pre-Easter dinner on Wednesday (April 16) with remarks from Trump and musical performances. It states that Trump's message included defending the Christian faith, but again, this might be from the proclamation. \n\nSource [11] reports Trump's comments during Holy Week events, including the dinner. It quotes him urging prayers for an \"outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon our beloved nation\" and mentions the White House Faith Office's role. The term \"Faith Office\" is used here, which includes the word \"Faith.\" However, the question is whether Trump himself said \"Faith\" during the dinner. \n\nSource [4] mentions Kenneth Copeland's attendance but doesn't provide Trump's exact words.

However, the exact transcript isn't provided.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3.

It carefully examines the available sources and the context of the event, focusing on whether Donald Trump said 'Faith' during the Easter Dinner. The solver's recommendation of 'No' (p1) is based on the absence of direct evidence of Trump using the word 'Faith' during the dinner, despite the thematic emphasis on faith-related activities. The response is cautious and adheres to the requirement for verifiable evidence, which is appropriate given the nature of the query.",
