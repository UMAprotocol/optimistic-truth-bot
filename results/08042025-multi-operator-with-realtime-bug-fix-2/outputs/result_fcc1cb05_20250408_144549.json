  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744116205 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-08 12:43:25 UTC",

The key here is to determine who won that game using the provided search results.\n\nFirst, I'll check the date and time. The current timestamp is April 8, 2025, so the game on April 4 has already occurred. That means I don't have to worry about it being a future event. Now, looking at the search results, there are several sources to consider.\n\nResult [1] is a betting odds page from April 4, but it doesn't mention the actual outcome. It lists the starting pitchers and some odds, but no final score. Result [2] is a preview of the home opener, also from April 4, but again, it's a preview, not a recap. The actual game results aren't here.\n\nResult [3] and [6] are YouTube video highlights from April 5, titled \"Guardians vs. Angels Game Highlights (4/4/25)\". These might show the game's outcome. The transcripts mention plays, like a home run by Logan O'Hoppe and Joe Adell's RBI double. The final score mentioned in [6] is 8-6 Guardians. That's a key point.\n\nResult [4] from ESPN's matchup page on April 5 shows the Guardians with 6 runs and the Angels with 4. But wait, the box score in [5] lists the Guardians with 9 runs and the Angels with 4. Hmm, inconsistency here. Need to check which is correct.\n\nResult [7] is an ESPN recap from April 5 titled \"Guardians 8-6 Angels (Apr 4, 2025) Game Recap\". The detailed recap states Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez hit three homers, leading the Guardians to an 8-6 victory. This seems definitive. The article also mentions the Angels' loss despite Mike Trout's homer. \n\nResult [8] from the LA Times on April 6 discusses a subsequent game on April 5 where the Angels won 10-4. But the query is about the April 4 game. \n\nCross-referencing the sources, the most reliable seems to be the ESPN recap [7] which clearly states the Guardians won 8-6. The YouTube highlights [3][6] also support this with the final score mentioned. The box score in [5] might have a typo or different game reference, but the recap is more trustworthy. \n\nTherefore, the Cleveland Guardians won the game on April 4, 2025. According to the ancillary data, a Guardians win resolves to p1. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, so no need for p3. The correct resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.).

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
