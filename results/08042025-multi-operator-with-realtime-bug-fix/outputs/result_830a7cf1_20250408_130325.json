  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744109865 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-08 10:57:45 UTC",

The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Yes\" if any previously classified files are released by that date. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is April 8, 2025. The deadline was April 4, so the event date is in the past. According to the rules, if the event date has passed and there's no verifiable information, I should assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But I need to check the provided sources for any evidence of release.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are several relevant sources. Source [1] from March 26, 2025, mentions Trump ordered immediate declassification, and the DOJ is instructed to release the materials. Source [5] is the actual presidential memorandum dated March 25, 2025, directing the Attorney General to make the declassified materials public immediately. Source [6] and [9] are videos from March 25 and 26 confirming the declassification order. Source [14] and [15] also report on the memorandum and the directive to release the files. \n\nHowever, the key point is whether the files were actually released by April 4. The search results don't explicitly mention the release happening by that date. The memorandum says \"immediately,\" but without a specific date in the sources, I can't confirm the release occurred by the deadline. There's a possibility that the DOJ complied immediately, but without explicit confirmation, it's uncertain. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that announcements without implementation don't count. So even though Trump ordered the declassification, if the DOJ didn't act by April 4, it would resolve to \"No.\" However, the primary source is the government's official information. If the memorandum itself is considered a release, but the user's query specifies that the files must be publicly released, not just declassified. \n\nWait, the user's query says \"publicly releases any previously classified... files.\" Declassification doesn't necessarily mean release. The memorandum orders declassification and public availability, but the actual release might take time. The sources don't provide a specific date when the files were made public. Therefore, without confirmation that the release happened by April 4, I can't definitively say \"Yes.\" However, the memorandum is an official order, and if the DOJ followed through immediately, then it would qualify. But given the lack of explicit evidence in the sources that the release occurred by the deadline, the safest resolution is \"No\" (p1). However, the user's ancillary data says that eliminations of redactions count. If the declassification includes removing redactions, that might qualify. The memorandum mentions redactions in the cover letter remain classified, but other materials are declassified. If those were released by April 4, then \"Yes.\" But without explicit confirmation, it's ambiguous. \n\nGiven the conflicting information and the requirement to rely on official sources, if the presidential memorandum is considered an official release, then maybe. But the user's query specifies that announcements without implementation don't count. So unless there's proof the files were released by April 4, it's \"No.\" However, the memorandum is dated March 25, and the DOJ was instructed to release immediately. If \"immediately\" means within the timeframe, then by April 4, it's possible. But without a specific date in the sources, it's uncertain. \n\nIn this case, since the event date is in the past and there's no verifiable information confirming the release by April 4, but the order was given, the most probable outcome based on the conditions is \"Yes\" (p2), assuming the DOJ complied promptly. However, the user's instructions say if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. The sources indicate the order was given, but not the actual release. Therefore, it's possible the release happened, but without confirmation, it's safer to resolve as \"No.\" Wait, but the primary resolution source is official government info. The memorandum is an official action, but the release is the key. If the DOJ followed the order, then the files were released. Since the order was on March 25, and the deadline is April 4, there's a 10-day window. The sources don't mention delays, so it's reasonable to assume compliance. Therefore, the resolution should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

However, this pertains to a different investigation (classified documents case) and not Crossfire Hurricane. \n\nWithout explicit confirmation from the sources that the files were publicly available by April 4, it's unclear if the order was executed in time. The ancillary data requires actual release, not just an order. Therefore, the resolution would lean towards \"No\" unless there's evidence the release occurred by the deadline. Since the current date is April 8, 2025, and no sources confirm the release by April 4, the answer is likely \"No\" (p1). However, the user's additional instructions ask to focus on verifying the actual release. Since the sources don't confirm the release happened by the deadline, despite the order, the recommendation would be p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744109865 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-08 10:57:45 UTC",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744109865 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-08 10:57:45 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please provide a more focused analysis on verifying the actual public release of the files by the deadline, using credible and specific sources. Avoid speculative conclusions."
