  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744109007 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-08 10:43:27 UTC",

The user wants to know if the market should resolve to \"Yes\" because Trump mentioned \"April Fool's\" between March 28 and April 4, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain.\n\nFirst, I need to check all the provided search results for any mentions of Trump saying \"April Fool's\" during that timeframe. The key dates here are March 28 to April 4. \n\nLooking at the search results:\n\n1. Result [1] from March 5, 2025: Trump mentions not wanting to announce tariffs on April 1 because of April Fool's Day. But this is before March 28, so it's outside the window. Doesn't count.\n\n2. Result [3] from April 1, 2024: Trump's campaign suspension prank. This is from 2024, so way outside the timeframe. Not relevant.\n\n3. Result [4] from March 4, 2025: Trump's video where he mentions avoiding April 1 due to April Fool's. Again, March 4 is before March 28. Doesn't count.\n\n4. Result [6] is the transcript of Trump's March 4, 2025 speech to Congress. He says, \"I wanted to make it April 1st, but I didn't want to be accused of April Fool's Day.\" Again, March 4 is outside the window.\n\n5. Result [8] from March 21, 2025: Mentions Trump dubbing April 2 as \"Liberation Day\" to avoid April Fool's. But the article is from March 21, and the mention here is in the context of his previous statements, not a new mention within the timeframe.\n\n6. Result [14] from March 5, 2025: Repeats the same March 4 speech content. Still outside the window.\n\n7. Result [15] from March 5, 2025: Again, the same March 4 speech reference. No new mentions in the required period.\n\nThe critical point is that all instances where Trump mentions \"April Fool's\" are from early March 2025, specifically March 4 and 5, which are before the March 28 start date of the market's resolution period. There's no evidence in the search results of Trump mentioning \"April Fool's\" between March 28 and April 4, 2025. \n\nAdditionally, the April 1, 2025, prank by Trump (results [2], [5], [7], [10]) doesn't involve him saying \"April Fool's.\" For example, in result [5], he says \"Happy April Fools Day\" in a written message, but the resolution conditions specify that written usages don't count. The video in result [5] is from 2024, so it's irrelevant. \n\nResult [13] from April 3, 2025, mentions a British April Fool's joke but doesn't involve Trump. \n\nSince there are no verified instances of Trump verbally mentioning \"April Fool's\" within the specified dates, the market should resolve to \"No,\" which is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.).

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
