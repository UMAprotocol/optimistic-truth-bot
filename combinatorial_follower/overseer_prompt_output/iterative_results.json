    "original_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Volodymyr Zelenskyy will say \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" during his press conference with the Irish PM on March 12, 2025. Wait, actually, the query mentions Donald Trump's press conference with Miche\u00e1l Martin, not Zelenskyy. The user might have mixed up the names, but based on the ancillary data, the market is about Trump's presser with Martin.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The search results include several sources about Trump's meeting with Martin, discussions about crypto policies, and Zelenskyy's past statements. But the key here is the event on March 12, 2025, between Trump and Martin.\n\nLooking at the search results, sources [1], [4], [5], [7], [8], [19] discuss the meeting between Trump and Martin. Notably, in [7], Trump talks about trade issues with Ireland, including pharmaceutical companies, but there's no mention of him using \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" during that meeting.\n\nSources [9], [10], [11], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18] discuss Trump's crypto policies, including the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the White House crypto summit. However, these events are separate from the March 12 press conference with Martin. The crypto summit was on March 7, 2025, as per [12], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18].\n\nThe press conference in question is the St. Patrick's Day reception on March 12. Source [19] mentions that Trump hosted Martin at the White House for this event, but the discussion focused on trade tariffs and Ukraine, not crypto. There's no indication in any of the provided sources that Trump mentioned \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" during this specific event.\n\nAdditionally, the resolution conditions state that the press conference must be the one scheduled for March 12. The updates mention the St. Patrick's Day Reception at 5 PM ET as the resolution source. None of the search results indicate that Trump used those terms during that event.\n\nZelenskyy's involvement in crypto, as per [3] and [6], relates to Ukraine legalizing crypto in 2022 and market reactions in 2025, but he wasn't part of the Trump-Martin press conference. The query might have a typo, but based on the data, the focus is on Trump's statements during the March 12 event.\n\nTherefore, since there's no evidence in the provided sources that Trump mentioned \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" during the March 12 press conference with Martin, the resolution should be \"No\".\n</think>\n\nBased on analysis of the verified sources, there is no evidence that Donald Trump mentioned \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" during his March 12, 2025 St. Patrick's Day press conference/reception with Irish Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin. The meeting focused on trade relations, pharmaceutical companies, and geopolitical issues rather than cryptocurrency topics[1][4][7][19]. While Trump announced crypto-related policies earlier in March 2025[9][14][15], these occurred at separate events like the March 7 White House Crypto Summit[12][16]. The resolution source specifically concerns the March 12 bilateral engagement where no cryptocurrency terminology was used by either leader according to available transcripts and reports[1][4][19].\n\nrecommendation: p1\n",

The current date given is March 14, 2025, which is after March 12. So the game should have already taken place. Let me look through the search results to confirm the outcome.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources ([1], [4], [5], [7], [8], [9]) mention the game on March 12, 2025. Specifically, result [1] states that the Red Wings won 7-3. Other sources like [4] and [8] also confirm the Red Wings' victory with Patrick Kane's 5-point performance. The box score in [7] shows the final score as 7-3 in favor of Detroit.\n\nSince the game was played and the Red Wings won, the market should resolve to p1. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the results. All sources indicate the game occurred as planned. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Detroit Red Wings defeated the Buffalo Sabres 7-3 in their NHL game on March 12, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources detailing the final score, key player performances, and game highlights[1][4][7][8]. Patrick Kane led the Red Wings with two goals and three assists, while Marco Kasper and Alex DeBrincat contributed multi-point efforts. The game included three fights and 68 penalty minutes in the third period but concluded without postponement or cancellation[1][5][9].\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\n\nBased on the above information, please provide your review, satisfaction level, reasoning, and follow-up prompt if needed.\n",
