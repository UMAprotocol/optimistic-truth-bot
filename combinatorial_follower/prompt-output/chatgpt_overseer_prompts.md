Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump will invite the Philadelphia Eagles to the White House by March 31, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. 

First, I need to check the search results to see if there's a clear answer. From the sources, especially [6], [7], [10], [11], and [12], it's clear that Trump did invite the Eagles. He announced the invitation on February 25, and the Eagles accepted by March 10. The White House confirmed the acceptance and even set a date for April 28. 

Some earlier sources like [1] and [2] mention initial confusion and rumors about declining, but later reports confirm the invitation was sent and accepted. The key here is the timeline: the invitation was extended before March 31, which is the cutoff. 

Since the invitation was officially sent and accepted, the answer should be p2 (Yes). The conflicting reports were resolved, and credible sources like Fox News, CBS, and the White House itself confirm the invitation. No ambiguity here. The market should resolve to Yes.
</think>

President Donald Trump extended an invitation to the Philadelphia Eagles to visit the White House following their Super Bowl LIX victory, fulfilling the requirement for this market. On February 25, 2025, Trump explicitly stated in a press conference: **"They will be extended that invitation... We'll do that right away"**[1][3][9]. The White House followed through, sending the official invitation the same day[7][10], and the Eagles organization confirmed acceptance by March 10[6][7][10][12]. 

Key timeline:
- **Feb. 25**: Trump announces intent to invite[1][3][9]
- **March 10**: Eagles confirm acceptance[6][7][10]
- **April 28**: Scheduled White House visit[12][13]

While early rumors suggested potential refusal[1][8], these were debunked by multiple credible sources including White House officials, ESPN, and CBS Sports[4][5][6][10]. The Eagles’ acceptance aligns with Trump’s public confirmation and subsequent logistical planning[11][12].

q: title: Will Trump say "Israel" during his presser with Ireland PM?, description: Donald Trump is scheduled to hold a press conference with MicheÃ¡l Martin, the Prime Minister of Ireland, on March 12, 2025.

This market will resolve to "Yes" if Donald Trump says the listed term during his appearance at this event. Otherwise, the market will resolve to "No".

Any usage of the term regardless of context will count toward the resolution of this market.

Pluralization/possessive of the term will count toward the resolution of this market, however other forms will NOT count.

Instances where the term is used in a compound word will count regardless of context (e.g. joyful is not a compound word for "joy," however "killjoy" is a compounding of the words "kill" and "joy").

If this event is definitively cancelled, or otherwise is not aired by March 12, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to "No".

This market is explicitly about the scheduled press conference with MicheÃ¡l Martin. Preceding bilateral meetings will not qualify toward this market's resolution. If the press conference contains a Q&A, it will count toward the resolution of this market.

The resolution source will be video of the press conference.

Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said "Israel" during his press conference with the Irish Prime Minister on March 12, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. 

First, I need to check the search results provided. The key sources here are the transcripts and articles from the event. Let's go through them one by one.

Looking at source [4], during the meeting with Martin, Trump mentioned Israel several times. He talked about Israel being under siege and the October 7 attacks. Direct quotes include: “Israel has been under siege, but you can see they had to fight back. Oct. 7 was a terrible thing..." and “We’re working hard with Israel. We’re working hard to see if we can solve the problem...” This clearly shows he used the word "Israel."

Source [11] also mentions Trump discussing Israel and the hostages, again using the term "Israel." Similarly, source [13] reports Trump's comments on Israel's actions and his administration's efforts. 

In the YouTube transcript from source [7], Trump is quoted saying, “Israel has been under siege as you can see and uh they had to fight back October 7th was a terrible thing...” Here, he explicitly says "Israel."

Additionally, source [12] includes a Sky News report where Trump discusses Israel's situation, though the exact term isn't quoted, but given the context, it's likely he used "Israel." However, the direct evidence from other sources is sufficient.

All these instances occur during the press conference with the Irish PM. The resolution criteria state that any usage of "Israel" during the event counts, regardless of context. Since multiple sources confirm Trump used the term, the answer should be "Yes," corresponding to p2.
</think>

During the March 12, 2025, press conference with Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin, Donald Trump explicitly mentioned "Israel" multiple times. He referenced Israel’s response to the October 7 attacks, stating, *“Israel has been under siege, but you can see they had to fight back. Oct. 7 was a terrible thing”*[4][7][13]. Trump also discussed U.S. collaboration with Israel, saying, *“We’re working hard with Israel. We’re working hard to see if we can solve the problem”*[4][7]. These remarks occurred during the bilateral meeting and subsequent press engagement, fulfilling the market’s criteria for resolution.

First, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date given is March 14, 2025, which is after March 12. So the game should have already taken place. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game occurred. Sources [1], [6], and [7] all mention the game on March 12, with the Clippers winning 119-104. 

Source [1] from CBS News states the Clippers beat the Heat 119-104. ESPN's recap [6] also reports the same score. YouTube highlights [2] and [7] back this up, showing the game happened. The betting prediction in source [3] was for the Clippers to win, which aligns with the actual result. 

Since the game was played and the Clippers won, the market should resolve to p2 (Clippers). There's no mention of postponement or cancellation in any of the sources. All evidence points to the game being completed as scheduled with a Clippers victory. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.

The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Miami Heat 119-104 on March 12, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources[1][6][7].

The game occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in the search results.

Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Seton Hall vs. Villanova game. First, I need to check if the game has already happened. The current date provided is March 14, 2025, and the game was scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 9:00 PM ET. Since March 12 is two days before the current date, the game should have already taken place.

Next, I need to verify the outcome of the game. The ancillary data mentions that if Seton Hall wins, the market resolves to "Seton Hall" (p2), and if Villanova wins, it's "Villanova" (p1). If the game was postponed or canceled, it's p3 (50-50). 

I should look for sources that confirm the game's result. The search results include a link to ESPN's game summary. Checking that, it shows Seton Hall won 66-56. This is a reliable source, so the result is confirmed. Since the game wasn't postponed or canceled, the resolution should be p2. 

Finally, ensure the response follows the required format, ending with the recommendation. The last line must be "recommendation: p2".

As the game concluded without postponement or cancellation, the market resolves based on the outcome where Seton Hall emerged victorious.

Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Air Force vs. UNLV basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET. The resolution conditions are straightforward: if UNLV wins, it's p1; if Air Force wins, p2; if postponed, wait; if canceled, p3 (50-50). 

First, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date given is March 14, 2025, which is after March 12, so the game should have already taken place. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game occurred. For example, source [1] from goairforcefalcons.com details the game's outcome where UNLV won 68-58. Similarly, source [4] from themw.com reports a 68-59 UNLV victory, and source [7] mentions a 68-59 win as well. ESPN's score in [8] also lists UNLV 68-59 Air Force. 

There's a slight discrepancy in the exact scores (68-58 vs. 68-59), but all sources agree that UNLV won. The difference might be a typo in one of the reports, but the consensus is clear. The key point is that the game was played, and UNLV was the victor. Since the event has occurred and the result is verified by multiple reliable sources, the market should resolve to p1. 

I also need to ensure there's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources discuss the game as having taken place on March 12, so no issues there. Therefore, the resolution is p1.
